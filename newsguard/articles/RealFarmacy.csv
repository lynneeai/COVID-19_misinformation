"Chinese Market at Center of Coronavirus Outbreak Sold Live Koalas, Rats, Snakes, and Wolf Puppies","The threat of China’s deadly coronavirus spreading to Australia is very real, experts warn.
As China continues to take extraordinary measures to contain the deadly coronavirus outbreak, “wet markets”—outdoor food markets selling both live and dead animals—have been labeled “ground zero” by authorities in regard to the viral epidemic.
The market facing the most scrutiny allegedly sells the meat of over 100 animals including exotic snakes, live rats, wolf puppies, live peacocks, porcupines, and even koalas, according to images circulating online.
??I volunteer to translate Public Livestock Wild Game menu items and prices:Live Sika Deer 梅花鹿 6000元Live ostrich 活鸵鸟 4000元Live peacock 活孔雀 500元Live #civet cat 活果子狸 130元Crocodile tongue 鳄鱼舌 45元/1斤Camel meat 骆驼肉 25元/1斤Bull testicles 牛蛋 12元/1斤
On Wednesday, state authorities banned the trade of live animals at wet markets. The popular Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan where the virus is believed to have begun was previously closed on January 1.
Dr. Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese agency charged with controlling and preventing diseases, confirmed that the virus—now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)—likely came from “wild animals at the seafood market” but did not go into specifics. The first to suffer from the virus were reportedly the employees at the Wuhan market.
The vast outdoor marketplace is comprised of rows and rows of narrow lanes cluttered with shopkeepers, butchers, and consumers looking for the freshest cuts of uncooked meat. As Business Insider reports, people and animals—both alive and dead—are in constant contact at the market, making it far easier for the virus to spill over from animal hosts into the human population.
Relatively common animals include pigs, hares, chicken, shrimp, and dogs, but an incredible array of exotic cuts can be found including giant salamanders, crocodile tongue, and civets. Chinese consumption of civet meat was the cause of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003, according to AFP. The SARS virus, which originated with bats, was found across wildlife markets in China.

One menu advertising a Wuhan market vendor boasts:
“Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door. Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses.”
While Chinese authorities have outlawed the trafficking of numerous wild species—especially since the outbreak of SARS—conservationists claim that the regulations are too loose in general but especially for species that are farmed for commercial purposes.
Exotic species are famously seen as delicacies across China and other Asian countries largely due to the legendary and often unproven medicinal benefits of eating the wild creatures. The consumption of exotic and even live animals is also seen as a symbol of social status.

However, revelations of the live animal sales have even shocked many locals.
One user of Chinese social network Weibo wrote:
“Just took a closer look at the viral wild animal menu – they even eat koalas.”
While another user responded:
“There’s nothing Chinese people won’t eat.”
In a statement made on Wednesday, Dr. Christian Walzer, executive director of the U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society’s Health Program, said:
“Chinese scientists believe the Wuhan Coronavirus originated in wildlife sold illegally in a live animal market. This virus is closely related to SARS and it now appears the spill-over to humans followed a similar transmission path. China closed Wuhan markets where this new virus was tracked back to – but similar markets occur in other cities across China and other Asian countries. 
If these markets persist, and human consumption of illegal and unregulated wildlife persists, then the public will continue to face heightened risks from emerging new viruses, potentially more lethal and the source of future pandemic spread.
Poorly regulated live animal markets, where wild animals, farmed-wildlife, and domestic animals are transported from across the regions and housed together to sell for human consumption provide ideal conditions for the emergence of new viruses that threaten human health, economic stability, and ecosystem health.”
Beijing is struggling to keep the coronavirus under control, imposing a quarantine on three cities after the virus killed 17 people and infected nearly 640.
Meanwhile, experts have warned it is “quite possible” that the deadly virus will spread to Australia.
“We do have a lot of traffic from China and I think it’s quite possible we will get some cases here but I’m very ­confident that we’re well ­prepared to respond if we do,” Australia’s Chief Medical Officer ­Brendan Murphy said.
Just moments ago, health authorities in Australia confirmed that a person in Sydney is under quarantine after possibly contracting the deadly coronavirus.

Italy Quarantines Entire Country Amid COVID-19 Outbreak,"Image: A military officer in the Piazza del Duomo in Milan on Tuesday after Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte declared a nationwide lockdown. Flavio Lo Scalzo/Reuters
Italy woke up on to deserted streets in an unprecedented lockdown on Tuesday after the government extended quarantine measures across the entire country in a bid to slow Europe’s worst outbreak of the coronavirus.
The measures, announced late on Monday by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, widen steps already taken in the rich northern region of Lombardy and parts of neighboring provinces, clamping down on movement and closing public spaces. 
“The future of Italy is in our hands. Let us all do our part, by giving up something for our collective good,” Conte said in a tweet, encouraging people to take personal responsibility. 
For at least the next three weeks, people have been told to move around only for reasons of work, for health needs or emergencies or else stay at home. Anyone traveling will have to fill in a document declaring their reasons and carry it with them. 
Large gatherings and outdoor events, including sports, have been banned, while bars and restaurants will have to close from 6 p.m. Schools and universities will remain closed until April 3. 
“The whole of Italy is closed now,” was the headline in the Corriere della Sera newspaper.
As day broke, the streets of Rome were eerily much quieter than normal, with cars circulating freely under a clear blue sky in the normally traffic-clogged center, reflecting the atmosphere in the financial capital Milan, already under stricter controls. 
Rome commuters could easily find seats in the usually jam-packed underground system during the morning rush hours. 
People wearing masks in the streets of the capital was more widespread than before. 
Shortly after the measures were announced, shoppers in Rome rushed to late-night supermarkets to stock up on food and basic necessities, promoting the government to declare that supplies would be guaranteed and urging people not to panic buy. 
Shops are allowed to remain open as long as customers maintain a minimum distance of a meter between them. 
The measures came after the latest data showed the coronavirus outbreak continuing to rise, with 9,172 positive cases recorded as of Monday and 463 deaths, the second highest-level in the world after China.

Deal Reached on $2-Trillion Coronavirus Bill. Payments to Citizens…,"After days of disagreements in the Senate over details in the coronavirus bill intended to help the economy and struggling Americans, Democrats and the White House agreed Tuesday to a nearly $2-trillion stimulus package. This includes direct payments to most Americans and a half-trillion-dollar fund to shore up struggling companies.
The stimulus bill — by far the largest ever proposed — comes with a price tag equivalent to 9% of the nation’s gross domestic product and is meant to provide direct financial aid to help individuals, hospitals, and businesses. It includes $300 billion for small businesses, $150 billion for local and state governments and $130 billion for hospitals, according to those involved in the negotiations.
Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) negotiated through Monday night and all day Tuesday to resolve outstanding issues.
A Senate vote on the deal could occur quickly, with the House potentially following soon after.
House members have not returned from their scheduled recess, and remote voting is not allowed under House rules. Pelosi indicated Tuesday that the fastest way for the House to approve the Senate bill would be by unanimous consent, a tactic generally reserved for small, noncontroversial legislation. It requires the consent of all current 430 House members, meaning a single representative could object, as long as he or she was on the floor to do so.
If that happens, Pelosi said she would probably need to call back the entire chamber for an in-person vote, a more time-consuming process that would also raise health risks and logistical challenges for members. It could also lead to potential changes to the legislation that would have to be reconciled with the Senate.
Despite the unusually bitter partisan bickering Monday on the Senate floor, Pelosi said earlier in the day that the final bill would represent a solid compromise between Senate Republicans — who crafted the initial draft with Democrat input– and Democrats, who delayed passage to ensure it included more of their priorities. “We think the bill has moved sufficiently to the side of workers,” she said.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) appeared to leave the final negotiations to Schumer and Mnuchin, though the Treasury Secretary made frequent trips between the leaders’ offices Tuesday.

New York Hospitals Now Treating Coronavirus Victims With Vitamin C,"Coronavirus patients in New York state’s largest hospital system who are seriously ill are being given megadoses of vitamin C. This is based on promising reports that it is being used successfully to treat the virus in hard-hit China.
Pulmonologist and critical-care specialist, Dr. Andrew G. Weber is affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island. He says his intensive-care coronavirus patients are immediately given 1,500 milligrams of intravenous (IV) vitamin C.
The crucial vitamin is given to the patients three or four times per day, Dr. Weber said.
Just one of these treatments is 16 times more than the National Institutes of Health’s daily recommended dose of vitamin C. NIH recommends just 90 milligrams for adult men and 75 milligrams for adult women administered orally. This is less than a tenth of a typical supplemental dose of vitamin C (1,000mg).
The IV vitamin C regimen for coronavirus is based on experimental treatments administered to COVID-19 patients in Shanghai, China, Weber said.
“The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C,” he said.
A spokesman for Northwell (which operates 23 hospitals, including Lenox Hill Hospital, Manhattan) said vitamin C was being “widely used” as a coronavirus treatment throughout the system. They also noted that medication protocols varied from patient to patient.
Out of 700 patients it is unclear how many are getting the vitamin C treatment.
The vitamin C is administered in addition to medicines such as hydroxychloroquine, the antibiotic azithromycin, various biologics, and blood thinners, Dr. Weber said.
New York hospitals have been granted federal permission to use hydroxychloroquine for desperately ill patients on a “compassionate care” basis. This drug is a synthetic version of quinine, the centuries old treatment for malaria that comes from the bark of the cinchona tree.
President Trump stated that the hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin combination therapy has “a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.”
Dr. Weber said vitamin C levels drop dramatically in coronavirus patients when they suffer sepsis. This is an inflammatory response that occurs when their bodies overreact to the infection.
“It makes all the sense in the world to try and maintain this level of vitamin C,” Dr. Weber said.
A clinical trial investigating intravenous vitamin C for coronavirus patients began Feb. 14 at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China.
The triple-blind, randomized study involves approximately 140 participants and is expected to be complete by the end of September, according to information posted on the US National Library of Medicine’s website.

Hospitals Considering Universal Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders…,"Hospitals on the front lines of the pandemic are engaged in a heated private debate over a calculation few have encountered in their lifetimes — how to weigh the save-at-all-costs approach to resuscitating a dying patient against the real danger of exposing doctors and nurses to the contagion of coronavirus.
The conversations are driven by the realization that the risk to staff amid dwindling stores of protective equipment – such as masks, gowns and gloves – may be too great to justify the conventional response when a patient “codes,” and their heart or breathing stops.
Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago has been discussing a universal do-not-resuscitate policy for infected patients, regardless of the wishes of the patient or their family members – a wrenching decision to prioritize the lives of the many over the one.
Richard Wunderink, one of Northwestern’s intensive-care medical directors, said hospital administrators have asked Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker for help in clarifying state law and whether it permits the policy shift.
“It’s a major concern for everyone,” he said. “This is something about which we have had lots of communication with families, and I think they are very aware of the grave circumstances.”
Officials at George Washington University Hospital in Washington say they have had similar conversations, but for now will continue to resuscitate covid-19 patients using modified procedures, such as putting plastic sheeting over the patient to create a barrier. The University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle, one of the country’s major hot spots for infections, is dealing with the problem by severely limiting the number of responders to a contagious patient in cardiac or respiratory arrest.
Several large hospital systems – Atrium Health in the Carolinas, Geisinger in Pennsylvania and regional Kaiser Permanente networks – are looking at guidelines that would allow doctors to override the wishes of the coronavirus patient or family members on a case-by-case basis due to the risk to doctors and nurses, or a shortage of protective equipment, say ethicists and doctors involved in those conversations. But they would stop short of imposing a do-not-resuscitate order on every coronavirus patient. The companies declined to comment.
Lewis Kaplan, president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and a University of Pennsylvania surgeon, described how colleagues at different institutions are sharing draft policies to address their changed reality.
“We are now on crisis footing,” he said. “What you take as first-come, first-served, no-holds-barred, everything-that-is-available-should-be-applied medicine is not where we are. We are now facing some difficult choices in how we apply medical resources – including staff.”
The new protocols are part of a larger rationing of lifesaving procedures and equipment – including ventilators – that is quickly become a reality here as in other parts of the world battling the virus. The concerns are not just about health-care workers getting sick but also about them potentially carrying the virus to other patients in the hospital.

"Japan Punishing Those Profiteering On Face Masks With Year in Prison, 1 Million Yen Fine, Or Both","The Japanese government is taking aim at those seeking to profit from the coronavirus pandemic by making the reselling of masks a crime punishable by a one-year prison term or ¥1 million ($9,800) fine, or both, Tokyo announced Tuesday.
The new rule is set to come into effect on Sunday and aims to prevent unethical would-be profiteers from using the scarcity of masks to their advantage for monetary gain, reports Japan Times.
However, a trade ministry official stressed that the rule does not seek to bar people from redistributing masks to friends and family or reselling them for the same price they were purchased for, or for lower prices.
The official said that the government simply seeks to “ensure that the average consumer can get their hands on masks.”
The rule is being implemented through a revised version of a law enacted to control panic-buying and price-gouging during 1973 oil crisis, when the world economy was upended after members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries launched an oil embargo.
At present, other in-demand products including diapers and disinfectants are not being included in the new rule, but they may be added later if Tokyo deems the move necessary. The rule will be lifted following a return to normal demand.
The move also comes after the trade ministry asked e-commerce and online retail firms such as Rakuten and Mercari to suspend online auctions of face masks on March 14, but resellers have still persisted in seeking to flip the highly sought-after masks.
Manufacturers have struggled to meet the surging demand for masks, even as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promised that the country would boost the supply of face masks to 600 million a month, with a priority on stocking nursing facilities.
Shizuoka prefectural assemblyman Hiroyuki Morota recently issued a televised apology after he was revealed to have made ¥8.9 million ($85,000) by selling packets of 2,000 face masks online in auctions for ¥30,000 to ¥170,000 each. The independent lawmaker, who runs a trading company, claims that he had surplus stock of the masks following the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome that first appeared in 2012.
Because Morota operates a trading company, he may not be classified as a reseller and could possibly be exempt under the new rule, the trade ministry official said.
Also Tuesday, Prime Minister Abe extended a request for large sports and cultural events to be canceled or postponed due to viral spread of the outbreak. The Japanese Cabinet also approved a bill that would allow the prime minister to declare a state of emergency if necessary as the East Asian country struggles to control coronavirus infections ahead of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, Kyodo News reports.

Canada Closes Border to All Travelers Who Are Not Canadian Citizens or Permanent Residents With Few Exceptions,"Canada is barring entry to all travelers who are not Canadian citizens or permanent residents, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced today — one of a set of extraordinary new measures being introduced to stop the spread of COVID-19.
There will be exceptions for air crew, diplomats, immediate family members of citizens and, “at this time,” U.S. citizens, Trudeau said.
The prime minister also said no one who is displaying symptoms will be permitted to board a flight to Canada, and that air operators will be required to complete a basic health assessment of every passenger based on guidelines from the Public Health Agency of Canada.
“I know this news will spark concern among Canadians traveling abroad. I want to assure you that our government will not leave you unsupported,” he said.
“To help asymptomatic Canadians to return home, our government will set up a support program for Canadians who need to get on a plane. Canadian travelers will be able to get financial assistance to help them with the costs of returning home or temporarily covering basic needs while they wait to come back to Canada.”
Trudeau also said as of March 18, international flights will be permitted to land only at the international airports in Montreal, Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver, in order to enhance screening.
“I know that these measures are far-reaching. They are exceptional circumstances calling for exceptional measures,” he said.
Trudeau said the new border controls will not apply to trade and commerce in order to keep Canada’s supply chain open.
CBC News is streaming the prime minister’s comments live.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is stepping up manpower, educational materials and screening measures at airports and all other entry points to Canada to help stop the spread of COVID-19.
Beginning today, all incoming travelers, no matter where their country of origin is, will be asked if they are experiencing symptoms such as coughing, difficulty breathing or fever. They also will need to acknowledge that they are being asked to self-isolate for 14 days if they’re arriving from any international location.
#COVID19: New enhanced measures continue to be added at all of #Canada's international airports including these new screening questions for ALL travellers arriving from ANY international destination. #FlattenTheCurve pic.twitter.com/kGZaDPt28N
All travelers seeking entry into Canada will have to answer the health screening questions and CBSA officers will be on the lookout for visible signs of illness. They will refer any traveler who they suspect of being ill, regardless of how the traveler answered the health screening question, to public health authorities for further evaluation.
A number of top cabinet ministers leading the COVID-19 response will also hold a news conference in Ottawa.
During a news conference in Toronto Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford urged the federal government to do more to contain the virus, including closing the border to all visitors. He said the border could remain open for trade and commerce, and to Canadian citizens returning home from other countries.
“I’m very concerned about reports coming out of the border. We need the federal government to tighten up the border and ensure proper screening and protocols are being enforced, and be prepared to take even greater steps to protect the health and safety of all Canadians,” Ford said.
There are now about 375 presumptive and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Canada.
The CBSA said it is adjusting its “operational posture” with enhanced border measures, and will continue to adjust to the “constantly evolving” situation.

"Man Busted for Stealing, Selling 2 Million Face Masks","New reports indicate that a Spanish entrepreneur ripped off approximately 2 million face masks from a warehouse and then sold all but 100 to neighboring Portugal before he was busted.
The suspect, identified only as the director of a well-known local real estate firm, swiped the masks and other protective equipment including surgical gloves back in February from a locked warehouse in the city of Santiago de Compostela — where a medical supplies company that had gone into liquidation was storing them, local police said, according to Metro UK.
The suspected thief then sold the items to contacts in Portugal, police said. Portuguese authorities helped investigators crack the case.
Meanwhile, the Spanish government was forced to buy face masks from China in an emergency purchase as the virus infected its citizens, according to the report.
Alfonso Rueda, vice president of the Xunta de Galicia regional government, visited the theft site Monday and found that only about 100 of the 2 million face masks stored there were left untouched.
“The police received a tip-off that there could have been valuable health equipment here which would have been so necessary in the fight against COVID-19,” he said, according to Metro. “It had been cleaned out by the time they arrived. We calculate 2 million face masks have been stolen. Only the boxes are left.”
“There are also empty boxes which contained surgical gloves but we don’t know at this stage exactly how many are missing,” Rueda added.
The alleged thief deliberately selected items he knew would have high resale value, the official said.
The man was identified and arrested by authorities, and has already made an initial court appearance, according to Rueda.

Boomerang: Now China Bars Entry to Foreigners…,"China announced Thursday it will temporarily suspend entry for foreign nationals with visas or residence permits beginning at midnight on March 28 in an effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Why it matters: It’s a sign that China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, is seeking to curb the number of imported cases in order to stop its epidemic from flaring up again. Diplomatic visas will not be affected.
What they’re saying:
“The suspension is a temporary measure that China is compelled to take in light of the outbreak situation and the practices of other countries. China will stay in close touch with all sides and properly handle personnel exchanges with the rest of the world under the special circumstances. The above-mentioned measures will be calibrated in light of the evolving situation and announced accordingly.”
— Ministry of Foreign Affairs
The big picture: Chinese authorities introduced unprecedented measures in January in an effort to contain the coronavirus, including suspending all travel in and out of all cities in Hubei province like Wuhan — where the virus was first discovered — and preventing the province’s 59 million people from leaving home.
On March 19, health officials reported no new coronavirus cases in a 24-hour period for the first time since the outbreak began.

15 Apps Parents Should Keep an Eye Out for on Their Kids’ Phones,"The arrests of 25 Florida men this summer for allegedly trying to have sex with children has prompted the sheriff to issue another ‘app warning’ for parents. So before your kids head back to school after the coronavirus panic passes, you should become familiar with the following information.
The aforementioned arrests occurred this past summer in July after the suspects responded to internet ads, online apps, and social media sites; says the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office.
In response, the sheriff listed 15 apps as ones that parents need to know about. (Six of them were used by suspected predators who were recently arrested.)
The first is ‘MeetMe,’ an app where teens can easily be in contact with users much older than them, with an emphasis on dating.
‘WhatsApp’ and ‘SnapChat’ are for messaging, but what you should know is teens can send unlimited messages, have video chats and even share their live location with other users, people they may not even know. 
‘Skout’ is a flirting app that’s used to meet and chat with new people. Teens and adults are in different groups, but ages aren’t verified. 
‘TikTok’ is used for sharing user created videos that can contain bad words, even adult content.
‘Badoo’ and ‘Bumble’ are dating apps for adults, but teens can still find ways to join. 
‘Grindr’ is geared towards the LGBTQ community. It allows users to share photos and meet up based on phone’s GPS location.  
‘Kik’ is specifically for kids, but anyone can join and anyone can contact or direct message your child. 
‘LiveMe’ is a live streaming app, but you don’t know who’s watching and your kids location is revealed.
‘Holla’ is all about connecting strangers around the world through video chat. Enough said. 
‘Whisper’ is a social confessional where kids can remain anonymous, but still share their feelings. And it can reveal your child’s location for a meet up. 
‘ASKfm’ encourages people to allow anonymous users to ask them questions, which opens the door for online bullying.
‘Hot or Not’ rates users on attractiveness.. There’s no age verification and users can send each other messages. 
And lastly, ‘Calculator%’ apps are several secret apps that allows kids to hide their photos, videos, even browser history. 
“Unfortunately, the internet allows for easy and anonymous access to children by strangers who are hiding behind a computer screen,” Sheriff Tom Knight said.

Seattle-Area Officials Report 3 More Coronavirus Deaths,"Update 2:55pm EST: At the news conference, five total deaths in the area were announced until Dr. Ettore Palazzo, the chief medical and quality officer at EvergreenHealth where some patients are being treated, announced a sixth death in Snohomish County. State health officials said they didn’t know about this death.
“So six should be the correct number,” said Dr. Kathy Lofy, state health officer for the Washington State Department of Health. “We were, at the department, aware of the five deaths from King County. We had not received the report about the Snohomish County patient just yet … apologize for that”
There are currently at least 18 cases in Washington state. Fourteen of which are in King County where the nursing facility is located. Four are in Snohomish County. Officials say there are 29 other cases pending test results.

Posted March 2nd, 2:38pm EST:Three more deaths due to COVID-19 have been confirmed in Washington State. This brings the total number of deaths in the U.S. to five. Health officials in Seattle reported the nation’s first two deaths over the weekend. They also said that several people at a local nursing home tested positive prompting a wider range of tests including 50 other residents and staff.
“We’re reporting four new cases today. Of these four new cases, two have died. In addition, one of our previously reported patients has died. This brings the total number of cases to 14, including five deaths total,” said King County public health officer Dr. Jeff Duchin.

Department of Justice Seeks New Emergency Powers; Detain People Indefinitely Without Trial…,"The Justice Department has quietly asked Congress for the ability to ask chief judges to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies — part of a push for new powers that comes as the coronavirus spreads through the United States.
Documents reviewed by POLITICO detail the department’s requests to lawmakers on a host of topics, including the statute of limitations, asylum and the way court hearings are conducted. POLITICO also reviewed and previously reported on documents seeking the authority to extend deadlines on merger reviews and prosecutions.
A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on the documents.
The move has tapped into a broader fear among civil liberties advocates and Donald Trump’s critics — that the president will use a moment of crisis to push for controversial policy changes. Already, he has cited the pandemic as a reason for heightening border restrictions and restricting asylum claims. He has also pushed for further tax cuts as the economy withers, arguing that it would soften the financial blow to Americans. And even without policy changes, Trump has vast emergency powers that he could legally deploy right now to try and slow the coronavirus outbreak.
The DOJ requests — which are unlikely to make it through a Democratic-led House — span several stages of the legal process, from initial arrest to how cases are processed and investigated.
In one of the documents, the department proposed that Congress grant the attorney general power to ask the chief judge of any district court to pause court proceedings “whenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation.”

Mexico Holds Massive Music Festival Despite COVID-19 Concerns,"While the coronavirus pandemic has led authorities around the globe to cancel concerts and sporting events, and even shut down daily activities in some places, Mexico City is going ahead with Vive Latino — one of the most important music festivals in the country.
Some acts backed out, but tens of thousands of music fans flocked on Saturday to the first day of the festival, which still expected Guns N’ Roses, Carlos Vives and Zoe to be among its headliners. Organizers said more than 70,000 tickets had been sold for each of the festival’s two days. 
Concerns about the new COVID-19 illness were evident, though. At the entrance, the usual security checks for such events had a new filter: Each person entering was checked for fever and a strong smell of antibacterial gel permeated in the air.

Google Releases Location Data To Help Authorities Check Lockdowns,"Google is releasing location data to officials in 131 countries so they can see if people are obeying self-isolating rules.
Alphabet’s Google division has on Thursday published data for 131 countries that shows whether people are obeying self-isolating and quarantine rules.
The ‘Community Mobility Reports’ from the search engine giant showed whether visits to shops, parks and workplaces dropped in March, Reuters reported.
March is when many countries around the world brought in their lock-down rules, and readers can click here to see the Google reports on their particular country.
Community Mobility Reports
The Google data comes after surveillance firm NSO Group this week claimed it was in talks with governments around the world about using its tracking software, which is already being tested by some nation states.
Google’s analysis of location data meanwhile has come from billions of users’ phones (those phones with a Google account that has location sharing enabled).
Google said that its Community Mobility Reports “were developed to be helpful while adhering to our stringent privacy protocols and protecting people’s privacy. No personally identifiable information, such as an individual’s location, contacts or movement, will be made available at any point.”
The Google data is said to contain charts that compare traffic from 16 February to 29 March on tube, train and bus stations, as well as supermarkets and other broad categories of places.
Country breakdowns
Italy of course remains one of the hardest hit countries in the world.
According to data from the World Health Organisation (WHO), 13,915 people have died in that country, with Spain’s death toll currently sitting at 10,348 as of Thursday 3 April 2020.
The Google data shows that Italians were obeying the lock-down rules, with visits to retail and recreation locations, including restaurants and cinemas, falling 94 percent, while visits to places of work fell 63 percent.
To underline how severe the impact Coronavirus is having in Italy, even visits to supermarkets pharmacies in Italy dropped 85 percent and park visits were down by 90 percent.
Meanwhile in the United States, California, which was the first to implement a statewide lock-down, visits to retail and recreation locations were cut by half.
But the Google data also showed that visits to supermarkets surged in countries such as Singapore, and the United Kingdom.
However, it should noted that the UK only implemented its lock-down rules on the evening on 22 March.

TikTok Coronavirus Prankster Arrested on Terror Charges After Licking Grocery Store Items on Video,"Warrenton, Virginia Police arrested a 26-year-old man after a video clip (below) was shared online of him saying “who is scared of coronavirus.”
The viral video led to calls from one of Britain’s morning show hosts for him to be arrested. 
Cody Pfister, 26, has been charged with making a terrorist threat following the “disgusting” act at a Walmart.
Viewers as far away as the UK and Netherlands are said to have made reports to the police.
Police said in a statement: “We take these complaints very seriously and would like to thank all of those who reported the video so the issue could be addressed.”
Piers Morgan, one of the hosts of Good Morning Britain, aired the clip on Monday as he blasted the gross behavior.
He showed the video in the hope people in the UK don’t get the same idea.
Piers led calls for his arrest and said he should be denied healthcare if he comes down with the killer bug.
He furiously said: “This is of somebody in America, who went to a supermarket knowing the coronavirus is attacking everyone in the United States and he did this and posted it online.
“What I would like to happen to him is I’d like him found, and I am sure they will get him.
“I would like him put in prison, immediately. And then I would like him deprived of any healthcare should he then get the virus having tried to deliberately give it to potentially lots of other people.
“That might concentrate the minds of these morons and it might concentrate the minds of these morons we have here.”
It was originally thought the video was filmed in Missouri, which is were Pfister is from.
Piers also tweeted: “Find him, arrest him, imprison him, and deny him any healthcare if he gets the virus.

America Stress-Bought All the Baby Chicks,"For chicken hatcheries, the weeks leading up to Easter are always the busiest. Spring is in the air for people shaking off long winters spent watching Netflix under a blanket who had hoped to emerge into a world of budding flowers, green grass and baby animals.
While spring might be calling people to congregate outside, health authorities are saying the opposite. Many schools and businesses are closed, and states and cities are implementing “shelter in place” orders to keep cases of the new coronavirus from skyrocketing.
The combination of an enormous rise in unemployment, anxious free time for those not struggling with illness, and financial instability has created a number of strange moments in economics. Here’s another: For the next few weeks, baby chickens are next to impossible to find.
Apparently when times are tough, people want chickens. Chick sales go up during stock market downturns and in presidential election years.
Murray McMurray Hatchery, of Webster City, Iowa, ships day-old poultry through the Postal Service, and is almost completely sold out of chicks for the next four weeks.
“People are panic-buying chickens like they did toilet paper,” said Tom Watkins, the vice president of the company.
Down at your Tractor Supply Company, a national chain of farm stores, long lines snake out the door into the parking lot before the store opens on the morning of a chick delivery. Many feed stores report they are selling out of chicks almost as fast as they can get new orders in.
Some of these buyers are simply replenishing their flocks, having put in orders weeks or months ago. But many people who have bought chicks in the last week are first-timers.
Amy Annelle, 48, is a musician in Austin, Texas, who hadn’t planned on getting chickens until the South by Southwest festival and an upcoming tour were canceled. Suddenly she found herself with plenty of time at home to raise birds, just as eggs and chicken began to run low at her local grocer.
According to the Agriculture Department, last week wholesale egg prices rose more than 50 percent in some parts of the country, because of demand; eggs have been running low if not sold out altogether in many stores in the United States. The egg supply is normal, of course; demand just grew significantly.
Ms. Annelle bought four hens and a rooster a week ago. “I thought I’d get some chicks before everyone panics at once and buys them,” she said. “We also wanted a fun project to keep us busy,” she added, referring to her and her partner.
Though Ms. Annelle cited food security as one of the reasons she wanted to have chickens, she realized that it would be at least five months before her hens are old enough to lay eggs.
She doesn’t know how long the quarantines and business closures will last, but said “it just seems like having a steady food source is a good idea right now.” The chicks have also been comforting in another way. “It’s just very hopeful watching them grow,” Ms. Annelle said.
Dominique Greenwell in Spokane, Wash., bought four chicks on March 23 from a nearby breeder (the feed stores were sold out) after a few days of internet research on how to care for the birds.
The hair salon she works at closed the week before, which has given her a lot of time to obsess over her new charges. “I go in there every 15 minutes to make sure the temperature is OK or to hold them,” Ms. Greenwell, 26, said.
She’s an animal lover with a miniature pig, a bearded dragon, two dogs and a cat already living in the household. “You can’t control the world around you but you can control the love you give to your animals,” she said.

Police Beg Public to Stop Calling 911 Because They ‘Ran Out of Toilet Paper’,"Police in Oregon posted a reminder to their Facebook page that urged the public to refrain from calling 911 if they run out of toilet paper due to the coronavirus panic.
“It’s hard to believe that we even have to post this,” police in Newport, Oregon wrote. “Do not call 9-1-1 just because you ran out of toilet paper. You will survive without our assistance.”
The post then pointed out the different methods used throughout history before suggesting other items that could be used in lieu of “your favorite soft, ultra plush two-ply citrus scented tissue.”
Among their suggestions: grocery store receipts, newspaper, cloth rags, magazine pages, cotton balls, and even leaves.
“Be resourceful. Be patient. There is a TP shortage. This too shall pass. Just don’t call 9-1-1. We cannot bring you toilet paper,” the post concluded.

United States Announces Extension of Virus Travel Restrictions to Include United Kingdom and Ireland,"President Donald Trump said the U.S. will broaden its temporary travel restrictions related to the coronavirus pandemic to include the U.K. and Ireland, two countries left out of an earlier order.
Trump confirmed reports that the restrictions are pending during a Saturday news conference at the White House that followed a meeting of his coronavirus task force.
“They’ve had a little bit of activity, unfortunately,” Trump said of the U.K. and Ireland. “We actually already have looked at it. That is going to be announced.”
The restrictions will go into effect Monday at midnight, said Vice President Mike Pence. “All our health experts” were unanimous on the advisability of the move, he said.

Coronavirus Patients Ordered to Wear GPS Ankle Monitors,"Two coronavirus patients and a family member in Louisville, Kentucky have been ordered by circuit judges to isolate and wear tracking devices after health officials learned they’d been in public against medical advice.
Issuing health-related civil orders is new territory for the courts, according to Judge Charles Cunningham, who issued two Friday. The third was issued earlier this month when a South End resident who tested positive for coronavirus refused to self-isolate.
But the orders are essential for keeping the community safe when infected patients refuse to self-quarantine, officials said during Mayor Greg Fischer’s Facebook Live briefing Tuesday.
As of Tuesday, seven people have died of the virus in Jefferson County and 18 across Kentucky.
“The home incarceration program is well-suited for this,” said Amy Hess, the city’s chief of public services, which includes oversight of Metro Corrections and Emergency Services. “It provides us with the proper amount of distancing. We can monitor activity after (the monitoring device) gets affixed to them … to make sure they’re not further affecting the community.
“We would prefer not to have to do it at all,” she said.

Hospitals Turn to Snorkel Masks to Ease Respirator Overload,"As hospitals face an overload of COVID-19 patients struggling to breathe, innovative medical staff are turning to snorkelling masks from sports stores to stop their lungs collapsing.
The idea started in Italy, the European country worst-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with hospitals in other nations taking note and adding their own specific medical parts to make it work.
One such is the Erasme Hospital on the outskirts of Belgium’s capital Brussels. It is attached to the city’s ULB university — and through it to a private spin-off, Endo Tools Therapeutics, whose knowhow in 3D printing for medical use has proved invaluable.
“They are to be used for patients with severe respiratory problems. The aim is to avoid having to intubate the trachea of the patient and put them on a respirator,” said Frederic Bonnier, a respiratory physiotherapist at the hospital who also teaches at the university.
He spearheaded the design of a custom-made valve that fits to the top of full-face masks, where the snorkel is meant to go, allowing them to connect to standard BiPAP machines that feed pressurised air into masks.
This helps prevent the collapse of alveoli, lung air sacs needed for the intake of oxygen into our bodies and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Pneumonia brought on by COVID-19 inflames the lung membrane and fills those sacs with liquid.
In the worst-case infections, patients have to be hooked up to respirators in intensive-care units.
But respirators are in desperately short supply worldwide because of the sheer number of patients.
The snorkelling mask solution could be a stop-gap measure for patients on the brink of intensive-care treatment but for whom no beds nor respirators are available. Hospital masks for the less-intensive BiPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure) machines are also lacking.

Timeline of China’s Coronavirus Outbreak and Cover-up,"Here is an eye-opening timeline compiled by Axios of the earliest weeks of the coronavirus outbreak in China, highlighting when the cover-up started and ended — and showing how, during that time, the virus already started spreading around the world, including to the United States. 
Why it matters: A study published in March indicated that if Chinese authorities had acted three weeks earlier than they did, the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by 95% and its geographic spread limited.
Dec. 10: Wei Guixian, one of the earliest known coronavirus patients, starts feeling ill.
Dec. 16: Patient admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital with infection in both lungs but resistant to anti-flu drugs. Staff later learned he worked at a wildlife market connected to the outbreak.
Dec. 27: Wuhan health officials are told that a new coronavirus is causing the illness.
Dec. 30:
Ai Fen, a top director at Wuhan Central Hospital, posts information on WeChat about the new virus. She was reprimanded for doing so and told not to spread information about it.
Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang also shares information on WeChat about the new SARS-like virus. He is called in for questioning shortly afterward.
Wuhan health commission notifies hospitals of a “pneumonia of unclear cause” and orders them to report any related information.
Dec. 31:
Wuhan health officials confirm 27 cases of illness and close a market they think is related to the virus’ spread.
China tells the World Health Organization’s China office about the cases of an unknown illness.
Jan. 1: Wuhan Public Security Bureau brings in for questioning eight doctors who had posted information about the illness on WeChat.
An official at the Hubei Provincial Health Commission orders labs, which had already determined that the novel virus was similar to SARS, to stop testing samples and to destroy existing samples.
Jan. 2: Chinese researchers map the new coronavirus’ complete genetic information. This information is not made public until Jan. 9.
Jan. 7: Xi Jinping becomes involved in the response.
Jan. 9: China announces it has mapped the coronavirus genome. 
Jan. 11–17: Important prescheduled CCP meeting held in Wuhan. During that time, the Wuhan Health Commission insists there are no new cases.
Jan. 13: First coronavirus case reported in Thailand, the first known case outside China.
Jan. 14: WHO announces Chinese authorities have seen “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus.”
Jan. 15: The patient who becomes the first confirmed U.S. case leaves Wuhan and arrives in the U.S., carrying the coronavirus.
Jan. 18:
The Wuhan Health Commission announces four new cases.
Annual Wuhan Lunar New Year banquet. Tens of thousands of people gathered for a potluck.
Jan. 19: Beijing sends epidemiologists to Wuhan.
Jan. 20:
The first case announced in South Korea.
Zhong Nanshan, a top Chinese doctor who is helping to coordinate the coronavirus response, announces the virus can be passed between people. 
Jan. 21:
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms the first coronavirus case in the United States.
CCP flagship newspaper People’s Daily mentions the coronavirus epidemic and Xi’s actions to fight it for the first time.
China’s top political commission in charge of law and order warns that “anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of [virus] cases out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity.”
Jan. 23: Wuhan and three other cities are put on lockdown. Right around this time, approximately 5 million people leave the city without being screened for the illness.
Jan. 24–30: China celebrates the Lunar New Year holiday. Hundreds of millions of people are in transit around the country as they visit relatives.
Jan. 24: China extends the lockdown to cover 36 million people and starts to rapidly build a new hospital in Wuhan. From this point, very strict measures continue to be implemented around the country for the rest of the epidemic.
The bottom line: China is now trying to create a narrative that it’s an example of how to handle this crisis when in fact its early actions led to the virus spreading around the globe.

"14 Plants and Herbs That Boost Lung Health, Heal Respiratory Infections, & Even Repair Pulmonary Damage","In addition to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), a wave of other viral and bacterial infections are sweeping across the world, and people are taking longer to heal from an array of symptoms within the respiratory system. If you are resorting to conventional medicine to address these infections with antibiotics, you are not only adding to the problems associated with antibiotic resistance, but you’re also doing little to address the healing mechanisms within your body to address the cause. Herbal remedies not only boost lung health, but they can heal infections and even repair lung damage. Here are 14 of the best herbs to boost lung health.
1. LICORICE ROOT
Licorice is one of the more widely consumed herbs in the world. In Traditional Chinese Medicine it occurs in more formulas than any other single herb because it is thought to harmonize the action of all other herbs. Licorice is very soothing and softens the mucous membranes of the throat and especially the lungs and stomach and at the same time cleanses any inflamed mucous membrane that needs immune system support. . It reduces the irritation in the throat and yet has an expectorant action. It is the saponins (detergent-like action) that loosen the phlegm in the respiratory tract, so that the body can expel the mucus. Compounds within this root help relieve bronchial spasms and block the free radical cells that produce the inflammation and tightening of the air ways. The compounds also have antibacterial and antiviral effects to them as well which helps fight off viral and bacterial strains in the body that can cause lung infections. Glycrrhizins and flavonoids can even help prevent lung cancer cells from forming which means they can even prevent lung cancer.
2. COLTSFOOT
Coltsfoot has been used traditionally by Native Americans for thousands of years to strengthen the lungs. It clears out excess mucus from the lungs and bronchial tubes. It soothes the mucus membranes in the lungs, and has been shown in research to assist with asthma, coughs, bronchitis, and other lung ailments. Coltsfoot is available in dried form for tea or as an alcohol extract known as a tincture.
3. OSHA ROOT
Osha is an herb native to the Rocky Mountain area and has historically been used by the Native Americans for respiratory support. The roots of the plant contain camphor and other compounds which make it one of the best lung-support herbs in America. One of the main benefits of osha root is that it helps increase circulation to the lungs, which makes it easier to take deep breaths. Also, when seasonal sensitivities flare up your sinuses, osha root which is not an actual antihistamine, does produce a similar effect and may be help calm respiratory irritation.
4. THYME
Thyme is very powerful in the fight against chest congestion. It produces powerful antiseptic essential oils which are classified as naturally antibiotic and anti-fungal. Thyme is a well known to zap acne than expensive prescription creams, gels and lotions. Thyme tea has the power to chase away and eliminate bacteria and viruses so whether your infection is based on either, it will work. Thyme has been used as a lung remedy consumed since antiquity and is used extensively to day to prevent and treat respiratory tract infections and bacterial infection pneumonia.
5. OREGANO
Although oregano contains the vitamins and nutrients required by the immune system, its primary benefits are owed to its carvacrol and rosmarinic acid content. Both compounds are natural decongestants and histamine reducers that have direct, positive benefits on the respiratory tract and nasal passage airflow. Oil of oregano fights off the dangerous bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, better than the most common antibiotic treatments. Oregano has so many health benefits that a bottle of organic oregano oil should be in everyone’s medicine cabinet.
6. LOBELIA
Did you know that horses given lobelia are able to breath more deeply? Its benefits are not limited to equestrians. It has been used as “asthmador” in Appalachian folk medicine. Lobelia, by some accounts, is thought to be one of the most valuable herbal remedies in existence. Extracts of Lobelia inflata contain lobeline, which showed positive effects in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tumor cells. Lobelia contains an alkaloid known as lobeline, which thins mucus, breaks up congestion. Additionally, lobelia stimulates the adrenal glands to release epinephrine, in effect, this relaxes the airways and allows for easier breathing. Also, because lobelia helps to relax smooth muscles, it is included in many cough and cold remedies. Lobelia should be part of everyone’s respiratory support protocol!
7. ELECAMPANE
Elecampane has been used by Native Americans for many years to clear out excess mucus that impairs lung function. It is known as a natural antibacterial agent for the lungs, helping to lessen infection particularly for people who are prone to lung infections like bronchitis. Herbal practitioners often recommend one teaspoon of the herb per cup of boiling water, drunk three times daily for two to three weeks but elecampane is also available in tincture format for ease.
8. EUCALYPTUS
Native to Australia, eucalyptus isn’t just for Koala bears! Aborigines, Germans, and Americans have all used the refreshing aroma of eucalyptus to promote respiratory health and soothe throat irritation. Eucalyptus is a common ingredient in cough lozenges and syrups and its effectiveness is due to a compound called cineole. Cineole has numerous benefits — it’s an expectorant, can ease a cough, fights congestion, and soothes irritated sinus passages. As an added bonus, because eucalyptus contains antioxidants, it supports the immune system during a cold or other illness.
9. MULLEIN
Both the flowers and the leaves of the mullein plant are used to make an herbal extract that helps strengthen the lungs. Mullein is used by herbal practitioners to clear excess mucus from the lungs, cleanse the bronchial tubes, and reduce inflammation that is present in the respiratory tract. A tea can be made from one teaspoon of the dried herb to one cup of boiled water. Alternatively, you can take a tincture form of this herb.
10. LUNGWORT
Lungwort is a tree-growing lichen that actually resembles lung tissue in appearance. However, this natural remedy doesn’t just look the part. As early as the 1600s, lungwort has been used to promote lung and respiratory health and clear congestion. Pulmonaria selections come in all kinds so seek an herbologist for direction. Lungwort also contains compounds that are powerfully effective against harmful organisms that affect respiratory health.
11. CHAPARRAL
Chaparral, a plant native to the southwest, has been appreciated by the Native Americans for lung detoxification and respiratory support. Chaparral contains powerful antioxidants that resist irritation and NDGA which is known to fight histamine response. NDGA inhibits aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis (the energy-producing ability) of cancer cells. Chaparral is also an herb that fights harmful organisms. The benefits of chaparral are most available in a tincture extraction but chaparral tea may support respiratory problems by encouraging an expectorant action to clear airways of mucus.
12. SAGE
Sage’s textured leaves give off a heady aroma, which arises from sage’s essential oils. These oils are the source of the many benefits of sage tea for lung problems and common respiratory ailments. Sage tea is a traditional treatment for sore throats and coughs. The rich aromatic properties arising from sage’s volatile oils of thujone, camphor, terpene and salvene can be put to use by inhaling sage tea’s vapors to dispel lung disorders and sinusitis. Alternatively, brew a strong pot of sage tea and place it into a bowl or a vaporizer.
13. PEPPERMINT
Peppermint, and peppermint oil, contains menthol — a soothing ingredient known to relax the smooth muscles of the respiratory tract and promote free breathing. Dried peppermint typically contains menthol, menthone, menthyl acetate, menthofuran and cineol. Peppermint oil also contains small amounts of many additional compounds including limonene, pulegone, caryophyllene and pinene. Paired with the antihistamine effect of peppermint, menthol is a fantastic decongestant. Many people use therapeutic chest balms and other inhalants that contain menthol to help break up congestion. Additionally, peppermint is an antioxidant and fights harmful organisms.
14. PLANTAIN LEAF
Plantain leaf has been used for hundreds of years to ease cough and soothe irritated mucous membranes. Many of its active constituents show antibacterial and antimicrobial properties, as well as being anti-inflammatory and antitoxic. Clinical trials have found it favorable against cough, cold, and lung irritation. Plantain leaf has an added bonus in that it may help relieve a dry cough by spawning mucus production in the lungs.
Seek the advice of an herbologist or Naturopathic Doctor on the preparation, appropriate dosages and frequency according to your condition. Many of the herbs above may also be combined for cumulative effects. All of the above are available in various forms, as nutritional supplements, tea blends and prepared oils. You can always grow your own as well to ensure your herbs are organic and ethically harvested.

"Italy Goes Full “Wuhan” — Orders Most Restrictive Lockdown Yet, as Global Case Total Passes 300k","Summary:
Massive surge in number of deaths and cases in UK, Germany, Spain, Italy, and France
New York, New Jersey deaths, cases accelerate
Italy goes under full lockdown
Rikers outbreak worsens: 21 inmates
NY Gov Cuomo: “months, not weeks” to control virus
Ukraine declares total quarantine
Belgium sees 25% jump in cases
Saudi Arabia reports 10% spike
German gov’t ends years of fiscal restraint with 365 billion euro aid package
NYC airspace closed after positive Air Traffic Controller test
NJ declares full state lockdown; “will take action” for people not following precautions
FDA authorizes first 45-minute COVID-19 test

Officials increasingly calling for the cancellation of the Tokyo Olympics
*  *  *
(ZH) (0940ET): After one of his aides tested positive, VP Pence was tested, and as it turns out, has tested negative, along with his wife, Karen Pence.
As New York emerges as America’s premier hot spot, the situation on Riker’s Island, the nation’s second-largest prison system, is growing increasingly dire. According to information from the city’s Board of Correction, 21 Rikers inmates, 12 jail employees and five correctional health workers have tested positive for COVID-19, up from just 8 the day before.
Already, one worker at the complex has died. Just like the prison outbreaks in China, the virus spread rapidly from workers on the periphery to the corrections officers to the prisoners. According to the New York Times, It started with a jails investigator in an office three miles from Rikers Island. Then, a correction officer at a security checkpoint near the entrance to the jail complex got it. Hours later, it was an inmate in a crowded housing unit.
Within days, the investigator had died and three more correction officers and two other staff members had tested positive for the coronavirus, confirming fears that the highly contagious disease had arrived in the nation’s second-largest jail system, endangering 5,300 inmates and twice as many guards.On Thursday, the jail system’s chief physician, Ross MacDonald, took to Twitter with a warning: “A storm is coming.”
Civilian employees in the prison system were ordered to remain home for two weeks to limit the number of people entering the prisons. More controversially, visits by friends and family have been suspended, something that the inmates aren’t exactly thrilled about.
Let’s hope they don’t react like some prisoners in Italy did. 
*  *  *
Update (1835ET): Even after threatening Italians in some areas with serious criminal penalties for violating their stringent quarantine orders, it seems Italy’s coronavirus containment efforts have failed.
After reporting another shocking jump in deaths, the Italian government has gone full “Wuhan”, ordering a complete shutdown of industrial production for 15 days.
In a speech delivered just before midnight on Saturday in Rome, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced that he is ordering ALL non-essential businesses to be closed, and for Italians to stay home.
These measures are slightly more restrictive than the current measures, which allow Italians more freedom to move about their towns and communities. They will also likely result in a much larger economic hit, as Italy’s industrial stalwarts are forced to pause operation.
And just like that, an entire country – 60 million Italians – is now under ‘shelter in place.’
Elsewhere, as Middle Eastern countries escalate their crackdowns, Kuwait announced that it would start imposing a curfew between 5pm and 4am due to what the government called “non-compliance with Ministry of Health’s instructions to stay indoors.” Meanwhile, the UAE has closed beaches and parks for two weeks.
As the number of confirmed cases in Europe and North America soar, the total global case total has surpassed 300k on Saturday.
Finally, an interesting snippet from the FT: Researchers on multiple continents say an usual symptom has emerged in the majority of Covid-19 patients: a loss of the sense of smell.
*  *  *
Update (1510ET): Across Europe on Saturday, deaths accorded to COVID-19 soared, with Italy reporting a record 793 deaths on Friday, and Spain reporting another 300 cases, bringing their totals to 4,825 and 1,326.
The UK also reported another string of deaths, as millions await a lockdown order on London, while hospitals and intensive care units in Italy and Spain are struggling to cope, despite some Madrid hotels being temporarily converted and of the Fair of Madrid, the capital’s main exhibition space.
As we’ve mentioned before, now is a good time for coffinmakers and funeral homes in Italy.

But these weren’t the only states seeing a spike. The total number of cases of coronavirus in Belgium rose by over 500 in 24 hours, a 25% jump bringing its total number to 2,815. The government also reported deaths had risen to 67, an increase of 30 over the same time period. According to the FT, a spokesman for the Belgian government’s crisis center advised people to establish a clear daily routine to avoid mental health issues.
In Ukraine, Arsen Avakov, the country’s interior affairs minister, called for a nationwide “total full quarantine,” warning that strict lockdowns and possibly martial law would soon be declared to stop the spread of the virus.
As we mentioned earlier, Germany is set to abandon six years of fiscal restraint with a blow-out budget designed to save its economy from the brutal effects of the coronavirus pandemic of €356 billion .
Even Saudi Arabia saw a 10% spike in cases announced on Saturday, with 48 new cases confirmed, bringing the total number in KSA to 392.
*  *  *
Update (1415ET): Just as Gov. Cuomo hinted earlier this week, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy has signed an executive order mandating that all non-essential workers living in the state stay home.
Meanwhile, a group of European countries have reported new figures, including Spain, which announced that more than 5,000 new cases and ~300 new deaths were confirmed over the past day, increasing the total number of cases in the country by 25% to 24,926, according to the Spanish Ministry of Health.
The death toll in the country is at 1,326.
Germany confirmed that it has agreed to take on over €150 billion of new debt as part of a €350 billion package of emergency measures to save its economy from the brutal effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
More devastating figures were released from Italy on Saturday, including announcing 793 new deaths, the highest total yet, bringing its total to 4,825, well above China’s total, and the latest in a grim string of records that has so far tracked the worst fears of epidemiologists. In total, more than 53,578 cases have been confirmed.
UK today saw total deaths reach 233 as the number of cases soared by more than 1000 to 5,015 from 3,983 on Friday. Italy was at that death figure on March 7. The UK patients were aged between 41 and 94 years old and all had underlying health conditions, according to NHS England. Earlier, two more deaths were recorded in Wales, bringing its total to five, and another death in Scotland, taking the number to seven. Northern Ireland has recorded one death.
Finally, France also just reported the biggest daily jump in covid cases, which soared by 1,847 to 14,459, while the number of deaths spiked the most yet, or 112 to 562 overnight.
Meanwhile, in Asia, Bangkok, Thailand’s capital, imposed a partial shutdown from Sunday as the number of confirmed cases surged past 400 with a rising number of people in critical condition. Malls in Bangkok will be closed, and shops offering food and essential services will be among the few allowed to remain open, Bangkok Governor Aswin Kwanmuang said during a press briefing on Saturday. The restrictions will begin Sunday, and continue until at least April 12, he said.
*  *  *
(1230ET): New cases are being reported out of New York State and NYC are being reported faster than we can keep up, as the state ramps up testing.
NYC officials just announced that the total number of confirmed cases in the city has climbed to 7,530. An hour ago, Gov. Cuomo put the number at 6,211.
By our count, this puts the new total cases in New York State at 11,675.
Last night, de Blasio described NYC as the “epicenter” of the US outbreak.
New York City has 5,151 confirmed cases of COVID-19, Mayor de Blasio announced, and said the largest U.S. city is now the epicenter of the crisis. Follow latest updates here: https://t.co/1S9iYGfKZK pic.twitter.com/u4FPfOxHBf
*  *  *
Update (1145ET): During Saturday’s press briefing, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made clear that he wasn’t waiting around for the military and FEMA to solve his state’s problems.
After announcing new restrictions that closed all “non-essential” businesses and threatened fines and other punishments for any “non-essential” New York workers who violate his ‘stay at home’ order (though, of course, certain activities like buying food, medication and doctors appointments will be permitted).
As state’s scramble to follow President Trump’s advice to try and acquire equipment through their own supply chains, Cuomo revealed that New York State had ordered 6,000 ventilators.
He also announced that he would be traveling around the state on Saturday with state workers looking for appropriate staging areas for the Army Corp of Engineers, which is preparing to renovate buildings to prepare more space for COVID-19 patients.
With a federal cost-sharing rate of 75%, New York State will be able to dole emergency funds out to counties, towns and cities, as well as the state’s Native American tribes. Nonprofits working in the state can also receive money if they meet certain criteria. Part of the money will pay for ‘crisis counseling’ for New Yorkers who are psychologically or physically impacted by the crisis.
As Cuomo’s press conference was ending, the state reported another 3,254 new cases of the virus, bringing its total to 10,356, making New York State the first in the US to pass 10,000.
Here’s a video from Cuomo’s press briefing:
Holding a briefing with updates on #Coronavirus. WATCH LIVE: https://t.co/uSqQdxYRUQ
In addition to ordering all nonessential businesses to cease operating outside the home, Cuomo ordered all people over 70 or with underlying health conditions to avoid public transportation and stay home except for solitary exercise.
*  *  *
For nearly a week now, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been begging the White House or the Pentagon to send in the Army Corp of Engineers to quickly transform existing businesses into coronavirus hospitals where patients from the impending surge can be isolated and treated.
If the state doesn’t quickly make up for its twin shortages of hospital beds and medical equipment, Cuomo warned, it could lead to thousands of preventable deaths.
Now, a few days after President Trump and Defense Secretary Mark Esper dispatched a Navy hospital ship to New York to help with the outbreak, President Donald Trump formally approved FEMA aid to the state late Friday night after declaring New York the nation’s first “major disaster area” since the start of the national outbreak.
Billions of dollars in emergency funding are now available to help combat the outbreak in the state, FEMA said in a statement.
“Federal funding is also available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency protective measures,” FEMA said in a statement.
President Trump’s national emergency declaration earlier this month activated FEMA, and made a pot of $42 billion in disaster-relief funds available.
The decision comes after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio claimed that his city has become the epicenter of the national outbreak, as public health authorities in the city counted at least one coronavirus-linked death per hour on Friday.
Between just 10 am and 6 pm, 14 people in NYC died from the virus, raising the death toll in America’s largest city to 43. It was the first time NYC’s daily death toll hit double-digits.
NYC Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot warned on Saturday morning that double-digit increases in deaths may become the new normal for New Yorkers, for at least a time.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if we get to a day when we have double-digits new people dying every day,” she said at a City Hall press conference Friday afternoon.
“With more and more cases confirmed here each day, it’s imperative that the federal government does everything within its power to stem the spread of the deadly coronavirus.”
In another rare moment of political unity, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praised the president’s decision.
Pres. Trump just approved a major disaster declaration for New York to fight coronavirus.Sen. @GillibrandNY and I pushed for this!FEMA needs to get to work NOW to open these MANY billions in direct aid for New York and individuals to help save lives and protect public health.
Yesterday, Cuomo ordered 100% of the state’s workforce to stay home, effective Sunday evening. Only essential businesses are allowed to stay open. And that’s not a request, that’s an order.
“These are not helpful hints…they will be enforced,” as Cuomo said during his Friday press conference, as we reported.
The latest data show 8,299 confirmed cases in New York State. And as the state runs out of hospital beds and precious ventilators, Trump is sending in the military, which is now working on plans to takeover hotels, college dormitories and sports arenas and turn them into ICU-like medical facilities, as the Daily Mailreports.
According to the latest federal data, at least 19,624 people have been diagnosed with the virus, and at least 260 deaths have been recorded. So far, 147 people have recovered. Globally, there have been at least 275,000 diagnosed cases and more than 11,000 coronavirus-related deaths.
With billions in federal funding flowing into New York, Trump’s decision to declare New York a “major disaster” will open up money available to eligible local and tribal governments and even nonprofits who meet the criteria, so long as they operate in areas affected by COVID-19 in New York State.
Initially, it seemed like the outbreak was developing in the suburbs,
Public health officials in New York State were gripped with anxiety earlier this month as a cluster of cases was confirmed in New Rochelle, including the town’s “patient zero”, a lawyer who commuted into Manhattan into his wife, also a lawyer. Both contracted the virus, kicking off a wave of infections in a Jewish community in and around New Rochelle.
Now, it appears swift action in wealthy Westchester County has brought the outbreak under control (or so it seems, at least).
The bigger problem now is an outbreak in Jewish communities in Brooklyn, based in the neighborhoods of Williamsburg and Borough Park. The clusters, though so far not explicitly acknowledged as such by the state, appear to be the biggest centers of infection in the city. De Blasio even admitted that Brooklyn is seeing the worst of the outbreak.
Switzerland reported another batch of new cases, bringing its total to 6,100 infections and 56 deaths.
As the global panic deepens, and the number of cases continues to multiply at an alarming rate, more officials are calling for the 2020 Tokyo Games to be postponed – an unprecedented event that would probably rattle confidence in global markets, at least momentarily, as the world grapples with the unprecedented situation at hand. The IOC chief rebutted these calls again Saturday morning, according to reports in the Japanese press, but it definitely makes one wonder: If things keep getting worse, how much longer can they hold off?

Update (1355ET): NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio just released the latest figures on infections in NYC.
NYC REPORTS 3,615 POSITIVE COVID-19 CASES AND 22 FATALITIES
BROOKLYN HAS MOST CASES AMONG NYC BOROUGHS WITH 1,030 REPORTED
By the looks of it, the rumored cluster in Borough Park, an ultraorthodox neighborhood, is real. A report published by Gothamist claimed that more than 100 members of the ultraorthodox community in Borough Park and Williamsburg have tested positive at a clinic in the area.
Brooklyn: Clip, Borough park residents are being urged to listen to the health professionals who are trying to contain the #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/IAJ5nHFM1R
The CEO of the testing facility, which caters to the ultraorthodox community, confirmed the report.
John Lieberman, the CEO of Asisa Urgent Care, confirmed in a statement that the facility, which caters to Brooklyn’s Hasidic population, had identified more than 100 infections as of Tuesday.
“We are working on educating the Jewish community in particular to advise them how crucial it is to quarantine themselves, stay away from people, stay home and do not congregate,” he said. “We are hopeful the community will continue to understand the importance of this issue.”
The cases were first reported by the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. Asked about the possible cluster during a press briefing on Tuesday afternoon, Mayor Bill de Blasio denied any knowledge of the new development. “If we had a cluster, I assure you, we would tell you,” he said. “I asked this very day, we do not have any clusters in New York City.”
We suspect the city will soon change their tune and acknowledge that clusters have emerged within the community.

Update (1315ET): Italy just published updated coronavirus case data for the last 24 hours, and just as expected, the death toll from the outbreak in the Italy, with a population of just 60.5 million, has surpassed the death toll from the outbreak in China, a country whose population is more than 20x Italy’s.
ITALY DEATH TOLL FROM CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK RISES 427 TO 3,405, OVERTAKING CHINESE DEATH TOLL – OFFICIAL TOTAL
NUMBER OF CONFIRMED CASES OF CORONAVIRUS IN ITALY RISES TO 41,035 FROM 35,713 ON WEDNESDAY – OFFICIAL
The number of confirmed cases in Italy is roughly half that of China, which reported zero new cases in Wuhan – the epicenter of the global pandemic – yesterday.
So far, one in every twelve people to be infected in Italy are health workers.

Update (1208ET): A stunning video that has been making the rounds on social media – and has now been picked up by the BBC – shows the Italian Army helping to move coffins to cemeteries and morgues as Italy’s death toll is on track to pass China’s.

Update (1100ET): New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reported yet another round of new case data on Thursday as he held his daily press briefing following an earlier interview on “the TODAY Show”.
As NY emerges as the countrywide leader in testing, Cuomo announced that the state tested ~7,500 people on Wednesday night alone. The state confirmed 1,769 new cases last night, bringing the total to 4,152. 21 New Yorkers have died so far, along with 7 additional deaths in Conn (2) and NJ (5), bringing the tri-state area death toll to 28.
The new cases announced by Cuomo brought the total number confirmed in the US to more than 10,000. 
He also instituted a 90-day relief period allowing New Yorkers to delay mortgage payments during the period, but only due to financial hardship (not just because they feel like it). The state has already postponed any foreclosures, banned negative credit reporting and waiving overdraft, debit card and credit card fees.
Remember: We know that as more people are tested we will find more cases. Last night we tested over 7,500 New Yorkers and found 1,769 new positive cases. We will keep increasing testing to help #StopTheSpread. pic.twitter.com/Ai6NTzVnFZ
Watch his press conference below:

Cuomo also said he has no plans for a ‘shelter in place’ order.
After ordering businesses earlier this week to let at least half of their employees stay home on any given workday, Cuomo said the state would now require 75% of “non-essential” workers to stay home.
Germany’s latest batch of new cases raised its national total to 13,944, up from 12,307, and an additional 14 deaths, bringing the total to 43.
The Pentagon just confirmed that 2,000 national guard soldiers are deployed across the country as more governors have called up the national guard to assist with the virus response effort. According to the Military Times, governors across 23 states have mobilized components of the Army and Air National Guard to assist in their state’s response to the pandemic.
The states where guardsmen have been mobilized include California…
Gov. @GavinNewsom Places National Guard Personnel on Alert to Support COVID-19 Community Readiness pic.twitter.com/YjiyiFhZxC
…Illinois…
Governor JB Pritzker has activated about 60 Illinois National Guard service members to assist with COVID-19 response. These include 43 Airmen from the Peoria-based 182nd Airlift Wing's Medical Group and 17 planners and liaison officers from both Army and Air National Guard units.
…and Maryland, among other states.
I am prohibiting utility providers from shutting off any residential customer’s service or charging any residential late fees, and prohibiting Maryland courts from ordering the eviction of any tenant who can show that their failure to pay rent was the result of COVID-19.
Additionally, the Navy is dispatching two hospital ships, plus millions of pieces of vital medical equipment.
The State Department advised Americans not to travel, and told those still abroad to either ‘come home, or shelter in place’. 
Meanwhile, President Trump and the White House task force are preparing for today’s briefing, where President Trump is expected to unveil measures to get experimental treatments into the hands of patients, despite some resistance from the FDA.

Update: In keeping with the coordinated central bank response via Europe, the BoE held an emergency meeting on Thursday and has announced some unprecedented stimulus measures, including launching a £645 billion bond-buying program of government and corporate bonds “as soon as operationally possible.”
Meanwhile, the cut the target from a record low of 0.25% to a new record low of 0.1%

Update (0930ET): Just before the US open, health officials in the Netherlands reported a jump in cases to 2,460.
The Dutch government has announced a rescue package designed to shield companies from the impact of the coronavirus that Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said is unlimited but will likely cost tens of billions of euros. The government is working on eight measures, including a fund that makes it easier for firms to request compensation for lost revenues and helps them pay wages, Hoekstra said Tuesday at a news conference.
Swiss authorities warned Thursday that the situation in the southern canton of Ticino is rapidly unraveling as the government scrambles to secure more hospital beds. Ticino is situated along the Swiss border with Italy, and is the worst-hit region of the small Alpine nation.
Meanwhile, Tiffany said it would temporarily close all stores in the US.

(0920ET): With oil price benchmarks around the world sliding below $30 a barrel, the US, the strategic petroleum reserve will immediately buy 30 million barrels of oil, and eventually buy as much as 70 million.
In China, police in Wuhan on Thursday officially revoked the government admonition issued to Dr. Li Wenliang, the martyred doctor who was censored for trying to warn the government and the people about the outbreak.

Update (0835ET): It’s shaping up to be another busy day on Thursday as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said his goal is to get checks into the hands of Americans within three weeks, up from two yesterday.
Some updates from Europe: the Swiss press is reporting that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country climbed to 3,888.
Back in New York State, Cuomo reported another ~600 case jump to 2959 cases. The death toll in the state has climbed to 21, with at least 11 of those in NYC, as Gov. Cuomo warns that
After signing a paid sick leave law to guarantee pay for those under mandatory or precautionary quarantine into law, Cuomo appeared on “the Today Show” to discuss his response to the crisis, which has won him accolades from practically everyone, including President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and other conservatives like Candace Owens.
We are seeing the enemy on the horizon and they are approaching very quickly.What we do between now and then matters gravely.Do everything you can. Do everything you can to flatten the curve.It's up to all of us. pic.twitter.com/puhB4g99sC
The NY governor repeated his claim that the ‘hysteria’ surrounding the outbreak is more damaging and dangerous than the virus itself during a Thursday appearance on the “Today Show.”
It’s a claim he’s made several times during press briefings and television appearances.
“We know what we have to do on the virus. It’s going to be hard, it’s going to be disruptive but we know what we have to do there. The fear and the panic can actually get out of control more than the virus can,” he said in an interview on “TODAY” with Savannah Guthrie.
While he warned against increasing fear and panic, Cuomo said, “This is a war, Savannah. We have to treat it like a war.”
Cuomo appeared on the show one day after NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio. When asked about his spat with de Blasio over the ‘shelter in place’ order, Cuomo again rejected the idea, saying it would be unnecessary thanks to NY’s proactive efforts to quarantine clusters like New Rochelle.
“States don’t fight wars…they need the federal government…equipment, equipment, equipment is going to be key…the federal government has recognized and is acting  that responsibility…” Cuomo said, referring to the Defense Production Act invocation and the Army’s plan to send 2 Navy Hospital ships and millions of pieces of medical equipment across the US. Even Nancy Pelosi called on Trump to use his powers this morning.
New Yorkers should prepare to see an “astronomical” jump in cases as testing ramps up, Cuomo said. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing: the more cases exposed, the more quickly the government can act to stop the spread.
Meanwhile, in Spain, the country’s health minister declared that the government of PM Pedro Sanchez will pass a €210 billion stimulus package to help alleviate the crisis as the total number of cases in Spain has climbed 28% to 17,147. 169 new deaths were reported, raising the country’s death toll to 767, as we noted earlier.
At the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin and his staff are reportedly considering issuing a 50-year bond and 25-year bond to finance the $1.3 trillion stimulus, despite telling Congress during testimony earlier this year that demand for the 50-year bond was tepid.
As the number of cases explodes in India, PM Modi has halted arrivals of international flights for at least a week beginning on Sunday.
And as the virus spreads in Africa, South Africa said its total cases confirmed climbed to 158 on Thursday after reporting its first case of human-to-human transmission within the country.
In Hong Kong, researchers have apparently found samples of the novel coronavirus inside another dog, the second time the pet of a Covid-19 patient was also found to be carrying the virus.
However, pet owners needn’t worry – at least not yet. As CNBC’s Eunice Yoon reports, there’s no evidence that these dogs can be the source of the virus for humans.
Please don’t panic. So far #HongKong officials found no evidence that pet animals can be a source of the virus for humans- or that the virus can cause the disease in dogs. They advise to maintain good hygiene and “under no circumstances” feel the need to abandon your pet. ? https://t.co/kwnNQsQTdT
As more countries ramp up stimulus spending to calm shaky markets and nervous people, the German government is planning to eliminate the debt brake on Monday.

Following a barrage of easing measures by global central banks overnight, and more talk of German fiscal stimulus Thursday morning, stock futures have sunk back into the red as promising gains from overnight fizzled. 
It seems the world is finally waking up to some disappointing realities: In many places around the US, and around the world, millions of people simply aren’t heeding advisories – and, in some cases, emergency declarations – pertaining to avoiding.
In California, the backlash against Elon Musk and Tesla has intensified as the billionaire openly beckoned employees of his Fremont, Calif. factory back to work despite a ‘shelter in place’ order requiring everyone to stay home to avoid the virus. Now that testing is finally ramping up around the country, with New York State taking the lead with its aggressive drive-thru push, the total number of cases confirmed in the US climbed to 9,415 (according to Johns Hopkins data), an increase of roughly 50% overnight.
It’s becoming increasingly clear that President Trump’s decision to stop travel from China, although prescient, was clearly not enough to stop the virus’s spread in the US. Officials squandered the entire month of February, and the Trump Administration is finally beginning to realize just how far it has fallen behind.
The biggest news overnight was out of Italy, which has been reporting record numbers of newly confirmed cases and deaths, as well as a surprising number of young and healthy people hospitalized in serious condition. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte said Thursday that the government would extend the nation-wide lockdown beyond April 3 because too many Italians are disregarding the orders. The extension comes as Italy faces an alarming milestone: On Thursday, Italy is very likely to officially overtake China as the country with the largest number of deaths from the virus. 475 people lost their lives on Wednesday, the largest daily jump yet, taking the total in Italy to 2978. Officially, China’s death toll is 3,231, according to the WHO, though many suspect the real death toll is much, much higher.
As of Thursday morning in New York, Italy has recorded 35,713 cases, along with 2,978 deaths.
After pleading with Schengen Zone members to keep their borders open, the EU has closed its external borders to non-EU citizens as a growing number of countries close their borders. In the South Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, members of the British Commonwealth, have barred non-resident, non-citizens from entry. The closures will take effect on Friday, local time.
China again tightened its restrictions on foreign nationals traveling to the country by requiring airlines to “reduce” international flights.
In other news, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, announced on twitter Thursday that he had tested positive.
I would like to inform you that I have tested positive for #COVID19. I am doing well and in good spirits. I am following all the necessary instructions, as is my team. For all those affected already, and for all those currently in isolation, we will get through this together.
By now, we’ve heard dozens of dire predictions from Wall Street banks about the economic fallout from the crisis. At this point, a recession is virtually assured, and an all-out global depression – the likes of which haven’t been seen for nearly a century in the developed world – could arrive by the second quarter, according to JPM Morgan and Mohammed El-Erian.
Now, Germany’s Ifo Institute forecast a 1.5% contraction in the German economy after one of its preliminary gauges released on Monday showed a sharp drop in sentiment.
Yesterday, we saw some rumblings about Russian disinformation campaigns targeting the West, as Vladimir Putin seizes the opportunity to destabilize the West after taking steps to fortify Russia from the onslaught (by being one of the first major countries to close its border with China, among other measures).
A document sent to European lawmakers Monday by EU officials asserted that Russia is carrying out a “significant disinformation campaign” in an effort to sow discord and panic in Western nations over the coronavirus, according to a Reuters report. Reuters apparently got its hands on the 9-page memo, and now a handful of left-wing media organizations like Axios and the Daily Beast are spreading the news.
How much longer until the West blames the severity of the “Chinese Virus” outbreak on Vladimir Putin? At any rate, despite Russia’s lockdown measures, the country recorded its first virus-related death on Thursday. A 79-year-old woman died in a Moscow hospital, the country’s pandemic response agency said on Thursday.
Yesterday, we shared a report published by the Telegraph claiming that PM Boris Johnson had asked his cabinet heads to draw up plans for a total lockdown in London, with hefty criminal penalties for all those who disobey. Dozens of reports across social media showed how millions of Londoners appear to be ignoring the government’s advice, prompting the NHS to prepare to be overwhelmed by cases. Some have warned that tens of thousands could die in the UK thanks to Johnson’s perhaps misguided hope that he could shield the British economy from the worst of the fallout by simply focusing on containing the sick. Unfortunately, one of the themes of this outbreak has been millions of people putting their own petty wants and desires above protecting the public health.
Good morning to everyone who isn’t actively interfering with the public health effort.
Florida and Texas have finally shut down most of the beaches where thousands of undaunted spring breakers have continued to party.
It’s likely this crisis won’t truly be over until a vaccine is mass-produced. And looking forward, headlines pertaining to drug trials for treatments and vaccines might be some of the only positive news investors get. Unfortunately, the opposite happened on Thursday, when the first scientifically controlled clinical trial of existing antiviral drugs to treat Covid-19 has delivered disappointing results.
As the FT reminds us, the next important controlled clinical trial result to look out for involves remdesivir, a drug originally developed by Gilead Sciences of the US to treat Ebola. That trial is also taking place in Wuhan. Meanwhile, in the US, a vaccine trial is underway in the Pacific Northwest.
Though the trials are continuing in Wuhan, the epicenter of the crisis, which has been struggling against the virus since it first emerged in early December, finally saw a day where no new coronavirus cases were reported. While it’s important to take this news with a grain of salt, the city has pretty much reopened for business.
A few days ago, the NYT ran a story praising India’s response to Covid-19, which had kept the number of confirmed cases down. Unfortunately, the good times couldn’t last forever, and the Indian people are finally getting a taste of the hoarding and panic that has come to dominate life in the US. After Prime Minister Modi announced plans to deliver a televised address on Thursday, which prompted Indians to scramble to stock up on essentials as they feared a national lockdown order could be delivered during that speech.
In the US, Amazon announced that it had closed one of its warehouses in New York for deep cleaning after a worker tested positive for coronavirus.This is a major threat to the US, since Amazon has emerged as a last lifeline for US consumers. If its warehouses are sidelined by the virus, the gears of consumption could truly come to a screeching halt, per Bloomberg.
Bafin, the German financial regulator, joined Italy’s Consob and a handful of other European regulators by imposing restrictions on short-selling. Though the West has been reluctant to adopt the heavy handed measures imposed on China’s population, when it comes to markets, China style crackdowns on shortsellers are apparently more palatable. Handelsblatt reported Thursday morning that Germany could move ahead with suspending its constitutional ‘debt brake’ as soon as Monday.
After UK PM Boris Johnson announced earlier this week that he would close UK schools for all except the children of essential workers and those who wouldn’t have access to food otherwise, Gavin Williamson, his education secretary, said there are “certainly no plans” at this stage to force the closures of bars and restaurants, even as speculation about a possible London lockdown continues to grow. Another government spokesperson said Thursday that there is a “zero chance” of a London lockdown.
A few minutes ago, Spain reported another alarming jump in deaths and confirmed cases that was on par with the figures coming out of Italy. Spanish Covid-19 cases rose to 17,147 (prev. 13,716) and deaths climbed to 767 (prev. 558):
Back in the US, the state of Connecticut on Thursday confirmed its second virus-linked death as the US death toll nears 140, with 137 deaths confirmed so far.
Meanwhile, as millions of young people brush off the risks to their personal health due to the virus, Bloomberg has some disappointing news: New evidence from Europe and the US suggests that younger adults aren’t as impervious to the virus as they would like to think.

Watch: Quarantined Italians Record Video Messages With Dire Coronavirus Warning,"The video was produced by “A Thing By,” which is described as “a collective of filmmakers based in Milano,” according to the YouTube channel. The video was released on March 15, after Italy implemented a nationwide lockdown on March 9 in a desperate bid to contain the spread of COVID-19.
“Up until 10 days ago, I went to meetings for work, I’d go to dinner with friends, to the gym, to the hairdresser. The usual boring things, and that never hurt anybody,” said one woman.
“But in 10 days, life won’t be like this anymore,” said another quarantined resident. 
The people in the video go on to explain that infections in the country “will continue to increase,” urging their past selves to take the pandemic seriously with one man addressing his past self, saying the video would prove to him that “this all wasn’t bulls**t like you thought.”
“Ten days ago we had 2,000 people infected, now we’re at 18,000,” warns another resident. “We already passed 1,000 deaths,” he added. 
A health care worker also chimes in to address how dangerous conditions are at local hospitals. 
The description of the video says, “It is believed nations like the US, England, France, Spain and Germany are about 9-10 days behind Italy in the COVID-19 progression.” 
The video ends with hopeful messages from the residents explaining how they are coping with the lockdown, but urges those who are behind in social distancing practices to consider what will happen if the pandemic continues to go ignored. 
In bold writing at the end of the video, “We underestimated this. You don’t have to do the same,” appears as a final warning.

"GOP Senate Candidate Claims Coronavirus ‘Created in a Lab’ in Wuhan, China","A Republican running for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire has repeatedly claimed China likely created the novel coronavirus in a laboratory, a theory widely rejected by scientists and also pushed by pro-Kremlin voices seeking to sow discord. 
Donald Bolduc, a retired U.S. Army brigadier general and the former commander of American Special Operations Forces in Africa, is running to unseat Democratic incumbent Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in November. 
Like Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), who endorsed him in January, Bolduc has been telling reporters that he believes the virus was potentially engineered in a Chinese lab as a biological warfare experiment.
“It’s China’s fault,” Bolduc said Tuesday during an interview with “Gun Shop Guys,” a local New Hampshire podcast. “They started this shit and they weren’t transparent about it. And they probably created it in a lab. And now we’re stuck with it. And the whole world is stuck with it.”
He expanded on his theory during an interview with WMUR on Thursday, claiming the virus was an attempt at population control that was designed to have “a fatal effect on our older generation.”
“China created this worldwide epidemic,” he told WMUR. The virus was “probably a biological program they put together and it got beyond their ability to contain.” 
Bolduc that day also retweeted Twitter user @AngelWarrior321, an anonymous, pro-Trump account that has shared sexist, racist and Islamophobic content targeting Democrats. The tweet claimed the virus was “not designed just to kill us” but to also “destabilize the West’s economy” because “China wants to rule the world.”
Asked about the retweet Monday, Josh McElveen, senior adviser to Bolduc’s campaign, told HuffPost the tweet was shared in error and would be removed.
“As much as we’d like to have a zero defect environment, an unintended retweet occurred during an audit of social media accounts,” McElveen said in a statement. 
Bolduc reiterated his lab theory in a phone interview with HuffPost on Monday. He said he’s not a scientist, but he has a hunch that is based on his military experience as well as reports that are available to the public.
“I would not take off the table the possibility of it being a lab-created virus that was either accidentally leaked due to carelessness,” Bolduc said, “or at worst ― at worst ― intentionally released to see what the effects would be and it just got out of control.”
He later added: “I am not on the fence about it. I’m pretty much convinced in my own mind based off of the way China has reacted inside of China and outside of China that this was created in a lab and they’re trying to cover their tracks.”

Israeli Doctor in Italy: We no longer help those over 60…,"Italy suffered more coronavirus-related victims than China with 4,825 confirmed deaths and 5,000 confirmed patients in the last 24 hours, Channel 12 reported on Sunday.
Israeli doctor Gai Peleg, who is currently working to save lives in Parma, Italy, told Channel 12 that things are only getting worse as the number of patients keeps growing.  
As his department receives coronavirus patients who are terminally ill the focus is to allow patients to meet loved ones and communicate with them during their last moments despite the quarantine regulations.
Other reports claim that, as the numbers of dead increases, some families find themselves unable to secure a proper burial for their loved ones.  
Peleg said that, from what he sees and hears in the hospital, the instructions are not to offer access to artificial respiratory machines to patients over 60 as such machines are limited in number.

Italy Starts Mass Treatment with Hydroxychloroquine,"Doctors in Italy have finally began widely prescribing hydroxychloroquine in certain combinations in Rome and the wider region of Lazio with a population of around six million.
According to Corriere della Sera, a well known Italian daily newspaper, Dr. Pier Luigi Bartoletti, Deputy National Secretary of the Italian Federation of General Practitioners, explains that every single person with Covid-19 that has early signs, like a cough or a fever for example, is now being treated with the anti-malaria drug.
The drug “is already giving good results,” Bartoletti says while Malaysia reveals they have been using it since the very beginning. Bartoletti further adds that the drug:
“Must be used with all the necessary precautions, it must be evaluated patient by patient. It can have side effects. But those that take it are responding really well. 
We have just understood that the virus has an evolution in two phases and that it is during the second phase, after a few days (about a week), that the situation can suddenly, in 24 or 48 hours, worsen and leads to respiratory failure requiring intensive care.
The results that we are starting to accumulate suggest that hydroxychloroquine administered early, gives the possibility of avoiding this evolution in a majority of patients and is also helping us to prevent hospitals from filling up.”
Incredible. What is more incredible are the statements of Professor Christian Perronne, Head of the Infectious Diseases Department at the Garches University Hospital, made in an interview with a French weekly magazine.
Referring to the European Discovery trial in which UK is taking part with only 800 patients, Perronne says:
“I refused to participate because this study provides for a group of severely ill patients who will only be treated symptomatically and will serve as control witnesses against four other groups who will receive antivirals. It is not ethically acceptable to me. 
We could perfectly well, in the situation we are in, evaluate these treatments by applying a different protocol. In addition, the hydroxychloroquine group (which was added to this study at the last minute), should be replaced by a hydroxychloroquine group plus azithromycin, the current reference treatment according to the most recent data. 
Finally, the protocol model chosen will not provide results for several weeks. Meanwhile, the epidemic is galloping. We are in a hurry, we are at war, we need quick assessments.”
America is to start yet another study which is to take one month even while one thousand people or more are dying worldwide today. In Italy however doctors are finally not waiting anymore with Perronne saying:
“Even though the overwhelming evidence from large randomized studies is still lacking, I am in favor of a broad prescription for the following reasons:
1. We have a large body of evidence showing that in vitro hydroxychloroquine blocks the virus. We also have several clinical results indicating that this product is beneficial if administered early and we have no mention that it harms or is dangerous in this infection (only one study, poorly detailed, Chinese, on 30 patients with control group, did not observe any benefits but also no harmful effects). What is the risk of administering chloroquine straight away: nothing! 
2. This drug is very inexpensive 3. It is well tolerated in long-term treatment. Personally, I have successfully used it clinically in the chronic form of Lyme disease for 30 years at a dose of 200 mg or even 400 mg/day. 
I and hundreds of other doctors are able to judge its excellent tolerance in humans. The main contraindications are severe retinal and unbalanced heart disease. 
Cardiovascular events remain exceptional if care is taken: to proscribe self-medication – to check with the elderly taking a lot of drugs that there are no drug interactions (with long-term diuretics in particular) and that the rate of blood potassium is within the norm. 
Apart from these precautions, the undesirable effects are minor. They are even more so as the treatment is short, which is the case against Covid-19. 
It would therefore be wise to produce hydroxychloroquine in very large quantities without further delay, to make it easily accessible to infected people…

Hospital Uses Drive-Thru for Coronavirus Testing,"In the small German town of Gross-Gerau, you don’t go to the drive-thru for a burger and fries. You go to get tested for the novel coronavirus.
Designed to minimize exposure to medical staff and patients, the drive-in at the local hospital is one of several unexpected ways healthcare providers are tackling a fast-spreading outbreak that has killed over 500 people across Europe. [View sick map here]
“Extraordinary times call for extraordinary solutions,” doctor Roxana Sauer, a medical director at Gross-Gerau District Hospital, told AFP.
Since last week, suspected patients have been able to call ahead and consult a physician by phone, who decides whether they should be tested.
The person is then assigned a time slot and asked to park outside a side entrance of the hospital, where they are met by a doctor clad head to toe in protective gear.
After rolling down the car window, the potential patient is swabbed in the mouth or nostril before driving off again.
Their sample is sent to a lab which returns the result within 24 hours, of which the person is notified by phone.
Similar drive-through testing sites have sprung up in other German hospitals in recent days, as well as in South Korea, the United States and Britain.
“People love that it can be done so quickly and easily,” said Sauer.
The hospital’s managing director Erika Raab added: “For Germans, the car is their safe space, it’s where they feel comfortable.”

South Korean cases rise 60 to 893, Daegu city locked down.
In their latest update, South Korea has admitted 60 more cases, making a total of 893.
And, as the virus spreads, South Korea is about to go ‘full China’ on its people as Yonhap reports  the cities of Daegu and Gyeongbuk, where the virus is spreading rapidly, have been designated as special disease management areas for infectious diseases.o
Simply put, this means that, as Democratic Party spokesman Hong Ik-pyo explained, “A blockade is being considered by the government, and we are considering using some administrative power in areas such as movement.”
Locals have called this a strategy to “enforce the maximum containment policy” – in other words, full lockdown of a city of 2.5 million people (the 4th largest in the country).
*  *  *
Update (1845ET): The CDC has outmaneuvered the State Department and issued a travel warning on South Korea.
CDC WARNS AMERICANS ON TRAVEL TO SOUTH KOREA
This just hours after President Trump tweeted that it’s time to buy stocks because the crisis is under control.

Update (1825ET): As we mentioned earlier, the state of California has thousands of individuals under a ‘self-imposed quarantine’. But what, exactly, does this mean?
As the SF Chronicle points out, this figure is up from 6,700 last week.
The Press Democrat reports that all of the people under self-imposed quarantine recently visited China, but have no other connection to a sick individual, and have shown no other signs of the virus.
These people returned to the US either on or after Feb. 2 as countries started tightening borders.
While making a case for full-on quarantine might be difficult, Italy and SK have identified cases where the chain of infection is murky. Some haven’t traveled abroad. Some visited hot zones weeks ago and are just beginning to show symptoms.
It’s certainly something to think about consider that, as we reported earlier, the CDC only has only tested about 400 individuals.
* * *
Update (1745ET): Here’s more news while we wait for the new China and South Korea numbers to hit.
In the latest virus-related update out of Europe, Spain just reported its third case, according to Spanish newspaper El Pais.
According the report, the individual is a “traveler” from Italy.
SPAIN REPORTS 3RD CASE OF COVID-19 TRAVELER FROM ITALY – EL PAIS NEWS
In other virus news, two companies, UAL withdrew its 2020 forecasts on Monday night, citing a “~100%” decline in near-term demand from China. Mastercard also forecast lower revenue growth, citing the virus impact.

Update (1450ET): We spotted an interesting tidbit at the bottom of a recent update to the Monday’s NYT coronavirus liveblog:
The new virus presents Europe with perhaps its greatest challenge since the 2015 migration crisis. It could test the principle of open borders within much of Europe and the vaunted but strained European public health systems.
Could the outbreak present an opening for Matteo Salvini as he struggles to displace the Five Star-PD coalition and become prime minister?
In a country as badly in need of revenue as Italy, it would take a true disaster to suspend tax collection. Alas, it looks like that has finally happened, as Italy’s finance minister suspended tax payments in regions hard-hit by the virus.
* * *
Update (1425ET): Following the CDC confirming 18 new cases in the US, including two that were non-Diamond Princess related, Canadian public health officials have just confirmed that two individuals have tested positive for the virus, bringing the total number of infected in the US’s northern neighbor to 11, the Washington Post reports.
Like their American counterparts, Canadian officials insisted that the overall risk to the population remains “low”.
In British Columbia, a man in his 40s tested positive for the virus, provincial health officer Bonnie Henry told reporters. He is a close contact of a woman who health officials said last week tested positive for the virus after traveling to Iran, and is in stable condition at home.
Henry described the woman’s case as a “sentinel event” because it indicated that there could be “more widespread transmission” of the virus since she had not traveled to China or its neighboring countries.
Earlier Monday, Eileen de Villa, Toronto’s medical officer of health, said that a woman in her 20s who recently traveled to China also tested positive for the virus. She arrived in Toronto on Friday and had spent some time in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the outbreak.
Earlier, WaPo reported that the White House is alarmed by gaps in the American supply chain that could impact the response to the coronavirus if the outbreak becomes an out-of-control catastrophe.
The US insists that all of the cases in the country so far were infected in China, excerpt for 2, according to the NYT:
All the new cases reported Monday occurred among people who were flown back from Asia to the United States by the State Department, the C.D.C. reported, and nearly all involve former passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked in Japan. They are in quarantine on military bases in California and Texas.
Twelve other cases occurred in people who had traveled to China, returned on their own and became ill after arriving back in the United States. Two of their close contacts also became infected.
Those 14 people are either isolating at home (under supervision from health officials), being treated at hospitals, or have already done so. Four of those infected people have recovered, been through the quarantine periods and are back out in the world.
* * *
Update (1420ET): We’re noting some new info from the CDC about the latest cases diagnosed in the US. Of the 14 non-Diamond Princess-related cases cited earlier, two of them are new: One is in Humboldt County, and the other in Sacramento County, both in California, per the Guardian.
The CDC added that it’s preparing for outbreaks that could warrant the closure of schools and universities in the US.

Update (1350ET): Reports claim Washington is weighing a decision to expel Chinese journalists after Beijing cancelled the press credentials of 3 WSJ reporters over an allegedly ‘racist’ opinion column.
In response to Beijing’s decision, the State Department published an official condemnation.
The United States condemns the move by China to expel three @WSJ journalists. Mature, responsible countries understand that a free press reports facts and expresses opinions. China should not restrict #freespeech. https://t.co/szm0ujq2Ua
Looks like Bloomberg got the scoop:
Scoop from @nwadhams @SalehaMohsin and @JenniferJJacobs White House considering retaliating against China's expulsion of WSJ journalists with journalist expulsion of its ownhttps://t.co/pWmvg4AOwK
By expelling Chinese journalists, the US would be seeking to show Beijing that it won’t stand idly by and tolerate these press restrictions. For President Trump, whose administration has been characterized by a deep and abiding animosity toward the press, it marks an unusual example of Trump siding with the American media.
It also comes after the State Department last week designed five Chinese media organizations as “foreign missions”: these included Xinhua and the PD.
Also, it’s notable that the meeting where the administration officials reportedly discussed the retaliation was led by Matt Pottinger, a deputy national security advisor and former WSJ reporter who is purportedly the administration’s point man on Asia policy.
The administration’s options were to be discussed in a meeting of senior administration leaders at the White House later Monday led by Matt Pottinger, the deputy national security adviser who was once a Wall Street Journal reporter in Beijing, according to U.S. officials familiar with the deliberations.
There’s an intense debate over how severely to respond to the expulsions last week. Some advocate ordering dozens — and perhaps hundreds — of Chinese reporters to leave, while others say that’s not legally possible or in keeping with American values on freedom of the press, according to several of the officials.
While declining to comment on specific actions under consideration, John Ullyot, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said Friday that China’s move against the American reporters was an “egregious act.”
It’s also notable that WSJ is owned by Trump ally Rupert Murdoch.
In other news, the American consulate in Milan has said it will halt visa approvals until March 2 as the outbreak in Italy worsens.
Can’t say we blame them: Here’s an update of our chart of the cases in four of the countries with the largest outbreaks outside China.

Update (1340ET): A Chinese airline is reopening domestic flights as Chinese officials start to lower their crisis-level outbreak standards, while UAL said Monday that it wouldn’t cancel flights between the US and South Korea.
As China tries to encourage its people to get back to work, it looks like the CCP is now telling villagers that only obedience to The Party will cure the virus.

Update (1220ET): US stocks took another leg lower, falling to their lowest levels of the session with the Dow down 1,000 points, following the latest headlines out of the CDC confirming 39 cases of the virus have been detected among the rest of the ~300 individuals from the ‘Diamond Princess’.
The CDC reportedly opposed the State Department’s decision to allow 14 individuals who were confirmed to be infected to travel on the evac flight after their cases were confirmed just before takeoff, thanks to one of the many botched, drop-the-ball moments attributed to Japanese health officials.
This is exactly what they warned about: In addition to the 14 people who were already infected, it appears another 25 were infected on the flight back – where the sick individuals were separated by the rest using duct tape and a thin tarp-like sheet.
That brings total US cases to 53.
Meanwhile, the CD isolated 14 cases outside those who caught the virus aboard the DP.
U.S. CDC SAYS 14 CONFIRMED CASES OF COVID-19 AS OF FEB. 24, 39 CASES AMONG THOSE REPATRIATED TO U.S.
Six of these cases are believed to be in San Antonio, according to local press reports.

Update (1215ET): Just figured we’d point out: While WHO warns that there’s nothing to fear, Beijing is trying to force its population back to work after six provinces outside Hubei lowered their emergency ratings earlier.
Six provinces in #China lower #coronavirus emergency response level as of late AM today. Guangdong, Shanxi lowered response to level 2. Gansu, Liaoning, Guizhou, Yunnan lowered response to level 3.
That push has led to more scenes like this one:

Update (1115ET): Shortly before it voted to postpone its annual national congress, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in China passed legislation approving a crackdown on the illegal wildlife trade on Monday.
Though SJWs have insisted that criticizing Chinese practices like eating ‘bat soup’ is ‘racist’, WHO scientists warned Monday morning that initial research suggests that the virus was transmitted to the first human cases via consumption of a bat, or possibly a pangolin that had been exposed to the virus via a bat, WaPo reports.
We published an explainer about how the wildlife trade, which has been illegal on paper for years, managed to flourish in the Chinese countryside as a king of grey market due to its immense profitability. 
Now, it appears local farmers will be forced to return to growing crops, a far less lucrative trade than hawking bats and snakes, apparently.
* * *
Update (1015ET): As the White House prepares to request an emergency spending package from Congress as soon as this week – a package that could seek close to $1 billion, as we’ve previously noted – WHO’s Dr. Tedros said during the organization’s Monday morning press briefing that the outbreak isn’t yet a true “pandemic” because the world hasn’t seen “large-scale deaths”.
That’s right: On the same morning that the Chinese government is marching people back to work, warning them that if they get infected, they’re on their own, as if the entire country was one giant concentration camp, the WHO – which has repeatedly run interference for the regime – is insisting that the outbreak isn’t really that bad.
The cases in Italy and South Korea are definitely concerning he said, but are we seeing an uncontrolled outbreak? No.
An Iranian lawmaker just blew the whistle on some 50 deaths in Iran, and now suddenly cases are popping up all over the Middle East and Europe, and the situation isn’t really that bad.
But Tedros says we’re not witnessing “uncontained global spread” and that “using the word pandemic does not fit the facts. We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic.”
All nations battling the outbreak should prioritize three areas, Dr. Tedros added. These include: the safety of hospital workers, communities most at risk like the elderly, and others with co-occurring health conditions.
“This is a shared threat,” Tedros said. “We can only face it together, and we can only overcome it together.”
This comes nearly one month after the WHO declared the outbreak a global public-health emergency.
And this is what the curve looks like for cases outside China:
Confirmed cases in Italy:
Confirmed cases in South Korea:
Nothing to see here, gentlemen. Please, focus on the excellent dip-buying opportunity in front of you.
Finally, repeating some of his florid praise from the early days of the outbreak, Tedros said “other countries need to learn from China’s response”. Which we presume means that medieval lockdown is the way to go – but if you can tweak one thing, maybe try to get on top of the situation a little sooner.
Meanwhile, as Stars & Stripes reported earlier, US soldiers in South Korea are doing everything in their power to prevent an outbreak on an American base – a huge risk for US national security officials and the Pentagon – after the widow of a retired soldier who recently visited stores on a base in the southeastern part of South Korea.

Meanwhile, the first indications that the virus has already spread from Iran to some of its regional neighbors have already emerged: Oman has reported the first two confirmed coronavirus cases. The two cases are individuals who recently visited Iran.
This follows Bahrain reporting its first case overnight.
* * *
Update (0835ET): As the WHO team wrapped up its Monday press conference with what was essentially tantamount to a global confidence-building exercise in China’s response, a senior official from China’s National Health Commission said the coronavirus risk from Wuhan had gone ‘way down.’
Of course, if that’s true, then why did officials cancel a planned easing of the lockdown?
The official added that China has managed to stop the ‘rapid rise’ of infections in Wuhan, though they haven’t stopped the epidemic yet, and that the situation remains “grim and complex” – as President Xi said over the weekend.
Meanwhile, over in Italy, ANSA reports that a sixth person has died.
Even more alarming for futbal fans across the country: Four Serie A matches were postponed on Sunday, while others on Saturday went ahead.

When American traders logged off on Friday, they might have noticed a few suspicious headlines out of Italy reporting a sudden spike in cases. But anybody who spent the weekend away from their desks and Twitter might be surprised to find that the Europe’s third-largest economy is now host to a genuine crisis.
More than a dozen towns in Lombardy – the hardest hit region with 167 confirmed cases and 4 deaths – are on complete lockdown. According to the latest update, there are now 219 confirmed cases in Italy, as well as five deaths.
Angelo Borrelli, head of the country’s civil protection agency, said Monday during a press briefing that another 91 people are currently in isolation inside their homes.
Following the weekend spike,  Italy’s neighbors are getting nervous. Austria is exploring border controls, though Germany said Monday that it’s not currently considering closing its borders with Italy, an obvious attempt by the de facto leader of the EU to try and quell a continent-wide panic.
Elsewhere, more countries are tightening restrictions on South Koera. Hong Kong on Monday declared that it would stop non-residents from South Korea from entering Hong Kong.
This has sparked a bemused response from Hong Kongers on twitter.
A recent poll showed that a majority of the people in Hong Kong don’t trust the data provided by the Chinese government or the WHO.
* * *
In Italy, it seems like most of the dead fit the profile of elderly patients with co-occurring health problems. One of the two most recent deaths was reported to be a man from the village of Val Alzano Lombardo. He died at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo, near Milan. The hospital said the 83-year-old man (reports on his age differ) had a serious underlying health problem, but it didn’t specify what it was, according to CNN.
As WHO officials finished off preparations for their big press conference Monday morning, Beijing announced that it would delay the National People’s Congress, which had been set for early March. The move was telegraphed by leaked media reports well in advance.
Officials said Monday the key political meetings, originally due to take place from March 5, would be rescheduled. Analysts said the government in Beijing was worried about the optics of holding a large-scale public event while millions are living under lockdown. We agree – that would not be a good look for the CCP right now, especially after all of those videos of police rounding up violators of the lockdown who were probably just trying to find something to eat.
President Xi said one day earlier that China is in a “crisis” that would inevitably impact the country’s economy. But whatever the fallout, he promised it would be brief and manageable.
Following the departure of the WHO team from Wuhan, local authorities made an extraordinary decision: all of a sudden, the cities’ most senior officials announced a loosening of the city’s lockdown. Millions rejoiced.
But they were soon disappointed: Because three hours later, the order was reversed, we assume, after Beijing caught wind of it.
According to the SCMP, the retracted announcement was issued by a ‘subordinate working group’ that didn’t have official approval from their superiors. The individuals responsible will be ‘reprimanded’. The lockdown has been in effect since Jan. 23.
The order would have allowed non-residents with no symptoms and no contact with infected patients to leave, a decision that would have freed thousands of foreign students.
In other news, Guangdong, China’s second worst-hit province, has downgraded its level of alert, with local officials saying the outbreak has mostly been contained to Hubei.
As we reported last night, figures released early Monday in China reported 409 new cases of the novel coronavirus and 150 new deaths from the outbreak on Sunday. That brings the total number of confirmed cases to 77,150, with a death toll of 2,592 (which will be higher if the Iran deaths are confirmed). The majority of new cases, 398, were in Hubei.
In Israel, PM Benjamin Netanyahu is fighting for his political future in a critical upcoming election that could see him jailed if he doesn’t hang on to power. So the heavy-handed measures to contain foreigners suspected of carrying the virus are hardly a surprise. In the latest step to contain the virus, Israel will send hundreds of East Asian nationals back to their home countries in the coming days, according to the Israel Airport Authority.
While Iran remains the epicenter of the outbreak in the Middle East, and several neighbors have already closed their borders, the first confirmed case was detected in Bahrain overnight.
Now, just imagine if Trump did that.

"After Dog Tests Positive for Coronavirus, Pets Now Face Quarantine","All pets of people in Hong Kong infected with the coronavirus will be quarantined, with one dog already in isolation, the city’s authorities said Friday.
The move is the first reported case anywhere in the world of a government quarantining pets over the outbreak and was prompted by a positive test in the pet of an infected patient.
The canine has been placed in quarantine for 14 days as a precaution but has no “relevant symptoms”, Hong Kong officials said Friday.
“Nasal and oral cavity samples tested weak positive for COVID-19,” a government spokesman said without explaining why they tested the animal in the first place.
He said it was unclear whether the dog had actually contracted the virus or tested positive for low levels due to environmental contamination of the dog’s mouth and nose.
The animal was collected from the owner’s home on Wednesday after the 60-year-old woman was diagnosed with the contagion and placed in a hospital isolation ward.
It would be closely monitored, undergo further tests and held in quarantine until it returned a negative result, authorities said.
There is no evidence domestic animals such as dogs and cats can catch the virus or transmit it to humans but the department said all pets of infected people should be quarantined and tested for the virus for 14 days.
The financial hub has confirmed 94 cases of the new coronavirus in humans, with two deaths earlier this month.
The epidemic, which emerged in central China in December, has infected more than 83,000 people globally.

"Delta, United Airlines Sending Planes to Desert","Ninety miles south of Phoenix is an airport located in the middle of the Arizona desert just off of an isolated strip of I-10. With only one runway and no passenger terminal, Pinal Air Park doesn’t see commercial airline service but it is home to some of the most iconic aircraft ever to roam the skies. 
Known in the industry as an aircraft boneyard, Pinal Air Park is where aircraft are housed for long-term storage. In other words, it’s a retirement home of sorts for grounded airliners whose time has come as newer, younger planes take their place in airline fleets across the world. 
At the airfield in Marana, Arizona, the skeletons of old workhorses, including some from airlines that do not exist anymore, can be found baking in the desert sun. While their time in the sky has long passed, their parts continue to prove useful to current sky-bound aircraft.
Though most aircraft that enter storage in Marana never take to the skies again, the COVID-19 crisis has given the town a slew of new arrivals that airlines hope will only be temporary visitors rather permanent residents. 
Take a look at which aircraft some of the world’s airlines are sending to the Arizona desert to ride out the industry downturn caused by the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona is one the many aircraft boneyards located in the American Southwest, a region known for its hot, dry climates that help preserve aircraft.

Study Finds Coronavirus Looks Different in Kids Than in Adults,"We’ve all heard that coronavirus generally doesn’t appear to infect children with harsh, harmful side effects, compared to older adults.
Now, a paper released this week in the journal Pediatrics, which was based on 2,143 young people in China, details the spread of the virus in children. It reveals some more good news, but also some bad news.
The study reiterates that coronavirus infections are typically less severe in kids. In fact more than 90% of cases in children are mild to moderate, or even entirely asymptomatic (exhibits no symptoms).
The bad news: Children may be a critical factor in the disease’s rapid spread.
It’s important to realize that kids aren’t simply immune to infection. Children are getting infected across all age groups and genders and can easily spread the virus.
Half of the patients studied were from Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak, while the others were from neighboring areas. Their ages ranged from newborn to 18 years. The median age of patients was 7 years.
What does coronavirus really look like in children?
The analysis by Shanghai Children’s Medical Center researchers Yuanyuan Dong, Xi Mo and co-authors noted that 52 percent of subjects exhibited mild cases which were marked by the typical symptoms of a cold. These symptoms included fever, fatigue, cough, sore throat, runny nose, and sneezing.
An important revelation is that some of the patients who tested positive for coronavirus had no fever and only digestive symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
39 percent of the subjects were said to have ‘moderate infection’ which included pneumonia with frequent fever and cough, mostly dry cough, followed by a wetter cough. Some children had wheezing but no obvious shortness of breath.
Severe cases only accounted for 5 percent of the subjects. Even more rare were those who required critical care (0.4 percent.) Subjects with severe cases had early respiratory symptoms which were sometimes accompanied by gastrointestinal issues. 
Around one week after infection some children tended to have more difficulty breathing. Although rare, the severe cases quickly progressed to critical illness with acute respiratory distress or failure which in turn led to other organ dysfunction such as heart failure or kidney injury.
Pediatricians should pay special attention to the group of seven infants (11 percent of the total number of infants in the study), and two children in the age 1 to 5 range (15 percent), who progressed to critical condition. 
The study authors wrote, that “young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable.”
This is an important discovery because up until now young children were thought to have no issue combating the disease. With that being said, most young children are able live through a coronavirus infection without serious complications. Nevertheless it is important to be aware of dire possibilities, no matter how unlikely.
“Why most of the children’s COVID-19 cases were less severe than adults’ case is puzzling,” Dong and Mo wrote. “This may be related to both exposure and host factors.”
One theory is that kids are more isolated at home after the onset of the outbreak, and thus exposed to fewer potential vectors of infection. Researchers also suggested something in the children’s biology, perhaps a cell receptor that binds to the virus, might be less sensitive. Kids often experience colds and other respiratory infections during the winter months, they added. So children may have more antibodies protecting them than adults in the winter.
The editors of Pediatrics stated that they were releasing this paper early, ahead of its official publication due to the topic’s importance.
 Associate editors Andrea Cruz MD and Steve Zeichner MD say the study suggests “children may play a major role in community-based viral transmission.”
The data strongly suggests that children may have more symptoms that make them contagious. These symptoms include runny nose and gastrointestinal symptoms. This also raises concerns for the virus being in the feces for several weeks after infection.
“Prolonged shedding in nasal secretions and stool has substantial implications for community spread in day-care centers, schools, and in the home,” Cruz, a pediatrician from the Baylor College of Medicine, and Zeichner, an immunologist from the University of Virginia, wrote.
Adam Ratner, a doctor in pediatric infectious diseases at NYU Langone Health said the clear takeaway from the study is that coronavirus “is still something that has the ability to cause severe disease across the age spectrum.” He added that his hospital and his colleagues’ were “taking the idea of covid-19 in children very seriously.”
“We’re learning more and more about this disease every day for better or for worse,” Ratner said. “It’s still very early days.”

[Watch] U.S. Coronavirus Task Force Holds News Briefing,"Members of the White House coronavirus task force spoke today about measures being taken against the spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Vice President Mike Pence announced that U.S. travel restrictions on Britain and Ireland will go into effect Monday night. This follows the implementation of a travel ban from 26 European countries which became the new center of the coronavirus epidemic.

NCAA March Madness Basketball Games to Be Played Without Fans Over Coronavirus Fears,"The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has announced that fans will not be allowed to attend the March Madness basketball games due to coronavirus prevention measures. This decision affects both men’s and women’s basketball tournaments.
NCAA president Mark Emmert revealed in a statement that tournament games will have “only essential staff and limited family attendance.”
“The NCAA continues to assess the impact of COVID-19 in consultation with public health officials and our COVID-19 advisory panel,” said Emmert’s statement. “Based on their advice and my discussions with the NCAA Board of Governors, I have made the decision to conduct our upcoming championship events, including the Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments, with only essential staff and limited family attendance.
“While I understand how disappointing this is for all fans of our sports, my decision is based on the current understanding of how COVID-19 is progressing in the United States.  This decision is in the best interest of public health, including that of coaches, administrators, fans and, most importantly, our student-athletes.
“We recognize the opportunity to compete in an NCAA national championship is an experience of a lifetime for the students and their families. Today, we will move forward and conduct championships consistent with the current information and will continue to monitor and make adjustments as needed.”
The NCAA decision was released mere hours after Golden State Warriors told the press Thursday’s game against the Brooklyn Nets will be played without fans present. This was the team’s response to San Francisco Mayor London Breed’s ban on public gatherings of 1,000 or more people. The ban is a measure intended to prevent the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19).

How Do You Know If You Have COVID-19? Answers to 5 Common Questions,"The new coronavirus COVID-19 (2019 n-CoV) continues to spread and cases are being diagnosed in many countries, including the United States.
With initial symptoms that resemble other diseases, many people are wondering how to know whether to seek medical help.
The biggest risk factors for being infected with the new coronavirus are travel to China, particularly Wuhan and other areas of Hubei Province, and close contact with a person who has a suspected or confirmed n-CoV case. [Update March 5th: Travel to South Korea, Italy, and Iran are also high risk factors now. Source] Without those risk factors, the chance for the general American public of catching this virus is low.
However, the outbreak is rapidly changing, and it is unclear how the situation in the U.S. will evolve in upcoming weeks.
Most cases of 2019 n-CoV have had fever and signs of pneumonia, like cough or shortness of breath. In some cases people are not able to breathe on their own and require the use of a ventilator. A small percentage of people die.
If you experience any of these symptoms within 14 days of travel to China, or within 14 days of coming in close contact with an individual infected with the coronavirus, you should immediately call your health care provider. It is best to call ahead before going to a clinic or emergency room.
Your health care provider will evaluate you with the help of your state’s public health department and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If your travel history and reported symptoms fit with n-CoV infection, you may be tested for the virus. Right now that test can be performed only at the CDC, so your health care provider would send samples to the CDC for testing.
At this time of year many respiratory viruses are circulating in the community, including influenza, RSV, rhinovirus and human coronaviruses, which are different than 2019 n-CoV. It is much more likely that you have one of these viruses than 2019 n-CoV, even if you have traveled to China.
Yes. There are four human coronaviruses that circulate each year in the U.S. They cause 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract illnesses in the U.S., with mild symptoms akin to the common cold. Health care labs can test for these coronaviruses – but not for 2019 n-CoV.

Privacy Concerns Over China’s AI-Run Phone Apps That Track User Activity and Make Mandatory Coronavirus Quarantine Decisions,"As millions of people in China emerge from weeks of lockdown, their freedom of movement is largely dependent on phone apps. Apps, which allow people to move around after lockdown, have become an integral part of Chinese authorities’ management of citizens
The “health code” service – run on the ubiquitous platforms Alipay and WeChat and developed for the Chinese government – give users colour-coded designations based on their health status and travel history, and a QR code that can be scanned by authorities.
The apps are specific to each city or province, but generally people given a green code are allowed to travel relatively freely. A yellow code indicates that the holder should be in home isolation, and a red code says the user is a confirmed Covid-19 patient and should be in quarantine.
The apps have become an integral part of Chinese authorities’ management of people and their movements in and out of affected areas. When lockdown restrictions in Hubei province were lifted last week, the government allowed residents with a green code to travel within and out of the province.
Some restaurants, shops, hotels and other establishments ask for patrons to show their codes before entering. In Wuhan, only those with a green health code are allowed to take public transport.
However, the technology has raised concerns about their reach into people’s private lives and data.
There have been complaints by Chinese social media users about a lack of transparency over how the app works and what data it is storing. Some have reported being unable to change erroneous “red” designations, and questioned the reliance on internet connection and surveillance.
“Why should you let companies such as Alipay and WeChat monitor and trace you with the health code?” said one user.
“Can’t it be integrated into the chip of our ID card? And some people’s mobile phones are not connected to the internet. I don’t know what leaders are thinking?”
The apps rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user and government information, including a person’s medical records, their travel history and if they have been in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19.
According to screenshots of an English-language version of the Alipay app, applicants are asked for contact and passport details and recent travel, and for relevant medical certification. Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba that operates Alipay, said that it does not provide or operate the service and has no access to the data entered into it. The company said it provided technical support to the Hangzhou city government when it was developing its version of the software.
Official guidelines for the WeChat app say it takes basic identity and address details as well as “the history of close contact with suspected patients, history of travel and residence outside the resident”.
It draws on medical information including “symptoms (such as fever, cough), medical treatment, isolated observation, contact information, travel history of the epidemic area”, and the user’s travel history including the mode of travel and what seat they sat in, and details on the vehicle and its driver.
The health code app, launched in Hangzhou in early February, and described by state media as “Alipay Health code” spread to more than 100 cities within a week before it was rolled out nationally.

Coronavirus Patient Speaks from Hospital Bed on Social Distancing — ‘Stay Away from Other People’,"As illness and hysteria related to coronavirus spread in our local communities, most of us are focused on the numbers. How many people have the emerging disease in the United States, North America, and the world? We may ask how many hospitalizations, people in quarantine, and even, deaths are related to the disease.  And perhaps numbers are just the best way to gauge the spread of illness.
Yet, looking beyond the numbers there are unique and touching stories to be found in this pandemic. There are people behind this uncertain disease who have something to share and teach us all in these unbelievable times. One Ohio man, speaking from his hospital bed, is a great example of this sharing. With the help of social media, he has been able to offer the world his experiences with coronavirus and a personal take on social distancing.
Testing Positive
Kevin Harris, 55, has been severely impacted by the coronavirus infection. Beginning on March 2, 2020, Harris reported that he had a small cough and body aches, but he wasn’t worried. However, within 24 hours his health had taken a turn for the worse, as he developed a fever and increasingly acute respiratory symptoms. “I never had any signs until the night…I started coughing,” he said in a live Facebook video. “That was the first sign and it went downhill in 24 hours, like gangbusters. I woke up several times thinking I was gonna die.”
Harris was taken to hospital, and his medical team worked hard to stabilize him. Luckily, Harris did not die and he avoided cardiac arrest secondary to his respiratory symptoms. On March 11, 2020, he tested positive for coronavirus while still recovering in hospital. His case became the fifth confirmed diagnosis in Ohio state. As of March 16, 2020, Harris reports that he is “not out of the woods, but… better every day” as he continues treatment at Mercy Health St. Joseph Warren Hospital. How Harris contracted the illness is uncertain, as he stated he had not gone out much prior but feels a recent visit to the Cleveland Clinic may have contributed to his illness. (1)
A Patient’s Take On Social Distancing
Harris, a father of four, shared his experiences with coronavirus on social media in large part to spread the word on social distancing. “People need to stay away from other people. They call it social distancing” said Harris in his viral Facebook video. He let his viewers know that by keeping a safe distance from other people they could reduce their risk of sharing illness or becoming ill.
You can survive the Coronavirus!! (PLEASE SHARE)I HAVE NOT SHARED MY CASHAPP. PLEASE DO NOT SEND MONEY!
Giving his message a practical spin, Harris also urged “Do not go in the crowds. Do not shake hands. Stop hugging each other,” and “Wash your hands continually. Do not kiss on your kids. There are thousands of people carrying this virus around. They may never get it.” Harris’ pleas may come off as extreme at times, comparing coronavirus to a zombie apocalypse, but his authentic perspective and personal testament to the power of social distancing is moving to social media users everywhere. (1)
Social Distancing
Social distancing works due to the nature of the coronavirus (and other illnesses like it!) that are shared via respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and even regular respiration. For social distancing to be effective, at least six feet should be intentionally kept between yourself and other people. Common examples of social distancing include working from home instead of going to the office, visiting loved ones via electronic devices, and postponing or canceling large gatherings of people.
Social distancing is very important right now to slow the spread of coronavirus. By staying in to watch Netflix, ordering takeout, and enjoying long walks on quiet paths – you can really help save lives, reduce stress on healthcare facilities, and even save yourself some personal illness! If you haven’t started social distancing already, take Kevin Harris’ story as a ‘wake up call’ to start doing so. (2)

Crowds Gather and Pray as ‘Jesus’ Figure Appears in Tree…,"The sight of a “Jesus Christ” figure on a tree has led to dozens of locals breaking the coronavirus lockdown restrictions to see it in person, just days before the Easter period. 
Footage taken in the town of Magangue in Bolivar, Colombia, shows a large group gathering around the tree.
They can be seen taking photos of it as cameraman and journalist Rafael Rodriguez says: “Dozens of people are gathered here.
“They are here to see the figure of what they say or believe is the figure of Christ, they have forgotten about coronavirus and are currently here looking at this figure.”
What appears to be a figure like Jesus can be seen on the tree trunk. The branch formation even gives the impression the figure is hanging on the cross.
“It can clearly be seen, and everybody is praying and asking for Earth to be cured of this evil and for Magangue to be protected,” local shopkeeper Rafael Rodriguez told media outlet El Propio de Magangue.
Authorities are reportedly concerned the tree could become a pilgrimage site despite the coronavirus lockdown in the country.
The video also shows how people are ignoring social distancing rules, increasing the risk of infection.
Another journalist, Rodolfo Zambrano, said: “The figure appeared last Sunday night and people rushed there with candles and transformed the place into a pilgrimage site, which is concerning neighbours as a lot of people are going there.”
According to the latest figures from the Johns Hopkins University, Colombia has registered 1,579 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 46 deaths and 88 recoveries.

Half of Americans Don’t Trust Mainstream Media’s Covid-19 Coverage,"(ZH) According to a new poll, Americans are divided on whether to trust news media with information regarding the coronavirus outbreak.
As Statista’s Willem Roper notes, a joint poll conducted by NPR, PBS NewsHour and Marist, shows that 47 percent of U.S. adults responded by saying “not very much” or “not at all” when asked how much they trusted news media with coronavirus information. 
This poll also included questions asking how much Americans trusted President Donald Trump, with 60 percent saying they didn’t trust him with coronavirus information, and on public health experts, with 13 percent saying they had little to no trust.
Unsurprisingly, Americans views on the news media were split along partisan lines. For Democrats, only 33 percent said they had little to no trust in the news media. Republicans, however, responded at a substantial 60 percent on their lack of confidence in the news media handling coronavirus information. Independents were equally high in their skepticism at 47 percent
Democrats and Republicans have been pointing fingers at news organizations since the coronavirus outbreak began to reach the U.S. Some Republicans believed liberal-leaning news outlets were blowing the outbreak out of proportion to damage the presidency and economy, while some Democrats believed conservative-leaning outlets were endangering American lives by not taking the outbreak seriously enough.

"50,000 in Dozens of Italian Towns Placed on Lockdown Following Coronavirus Deaths","Fears of a global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic are growing around the world as cases of reported infections surge in areas outside of China. On Saturday, a dozen towns in northern Italy were placed on lockdown after two people infected with the virus passed away, amid a growing cluster of cases in the area. A total of 50,000 people throughout Italy were asked to stay indoors until further notice.
What is most alarming is that many of these cases that developed in Italy did not have any direct ties to China where the virus began, which means that there could be many more people infected who don’t even realize it yet.
Local authorities in the Lombardy and Veneto regions closed schools, businesses, restaurants and canceled all sporting events and religious services. Meanwhile, public offices were shut down in Milan, Italy’s business capital. Both of the patients who passed away in Italy were in their late 70s, but there have also been many young and middle-aged people who have lost their lives to the virus.
According to the Associated Press, here are currently 54 confirmed cases of the illness in Italy, but those 54 people have come into contact with hundreds of others in recent days and weeks. Authorities have been working to track down the people who these patients have come into contact with and place them into isolation. Currently, hundreds of these people have been rounded up and placed in isolation throughout the country.
In addition to the two patients that have already passed away, another patient, who was the first identified in the northern cluster, in the town of Codogno, is currently in critical condition. Despite the fact that this man is the first identified in the region, he had not recently traveled to China. 39 of the country’s 54 confirmed cases are in and around the town of Codogno.
Another cluster in Lombardy, Italy, could actually be traced to a man who returned from China on January 21, but it appears that these two clusters may have had separate sources and did not originate from the same patient, because researchers have not been able to find any clear link between these two clusters. Even more disturbing is the fact that the man who recently returned from China still has not exhibited any symptoms.
A recent case study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, suggests that people who don’t exhibit symptoms of the illness can still be carriers. The study highlights the case of a woman who caught the illness in Wuhan without showing any symptoms and then traveled from the city to spend time with family, where she infected five family members with the virus before she even realized that she was sick.
The number of cases is continuing to rise by the day. There are now over 76,000 confirmed cases of the illness all over the world, and over 2,000 lives have been taken by the virus so far. However, these statistics have been heavily debated, and are further confused by the fact that a variety of different tests and methods of confirming cases are being used, and these standards are changing constantly.
Currently, the virus has already spread to 26 countries and territories outside of mainland China.

Some States Are Handing the Addresses of People With Coronavirus Over to Police,"Privacy advocates assert that it doesn’t protect first responders and exposes the sick to privacy violations.
Two U.S. states — Alabama and Massachusetts — have begun providing the addresses of those known to have been diagnosed with COVID-19 to police in a bid to contain the spread and protect first responders who might answer a call where a coronavirus sufferer is involved.
Alabama began providing the addresses — but not names — to police and other emergency responders starting more than a week ago. The information is being distributed to 85 emergency communications districts in the state, and is then relayed to police officers and other first responders when they go out on calls.
“It’s only on an as-known, as-needed basis,” said Leah Missildine, executive director of Alabama’s 911 Board. “The impetus behind this is to protect first responders because 9-1-1 receives the information and coordinates the response of first responders. That was deemed the most efficient way to share this information.” 
Massachusetts’ order went into effect March 18. It allows the health board to share the addresses — again, not names — of people who tested positive for COVID-19 with emergency responders. The order cites a need for “continued operation of public health and safety services during the state of emergency.” 
The Massachusetts order specifies the information “may not be retained” at the end of the executive order, and that it should only be used for responding to emergency calls. The receiving entity of information must keep it “confidential.”
Arrol Sheehan, director of public information at the Alabama Department of Public Health, said her state’s authority to share the information is enshrined in Alabama state law. 
“The Alabama Department of Public Health was requested to provide addresses of patients home quarantined for COVID 19 to the Alabama 9-1-1 Board for the protection of first responders,” she said in a statement, adding that the department of health has also issued guidance on how the information should be used. 
Alabama may also release the information to other third parties, such as doctors or anyone deemed at risk should they become exposed. Sheehan quoted the part of Alabama law that authorizes such disclosures: “Physicians or the State Health Officer or his designee may notify a third party of the presence of a contagious disease in an individual where there is a foreseeable, real or probable risk of transmission of the disease.”

Government Wants Your Phone Data to Combat Coronavirus,"The U.S. government is in active talks with Facebook, Google and a wide array of tech companies and health experts about how they can use data gleaned from Americans’ phones to combat the novel coronavirus, including tracking whether people are keeping one another at safe distances to stem the outbreak.
Public-health experts are interested in the possibility that private-sector companies could compile the data in anonymous, aggregated form, which they could then use to map the spread of the infection, according to three people familiar with the effort, who requested anonymity because the project is in its early stages.
Analyzing trends in smartphone owners’ whereabouts could prove to be a powerful tool for health authorities looking to track coronavirus, which has infected more than 180,000 people globally. But it’s also an approach that could leave some Americans uncomfortable, depending on how it’s implemented, given the sensitivity when it comes to details about their daily whereabouts.
In recent interviews, Facebook executives said the U.S. government is particularly interested in understanding patterns of people’s movements, which can be derived through data the company collects from users who allow it. The tech giant in the past has provided this information to researchers in the form of statistics, which in the case of coronavirus, could help officials predict the next hotspot or decide where to allocate overstretched health resources.
“We’re encouraged by American technology companies looking to leverage aggregate, anonymized data to glean key insights for covid-19 modeling efforts,” said an official with the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
The official said those insights might “help public health officials, researchers, and scientists improve their understanding of the spread of COVID19 and transmission of the disease.” Multiple sources stressed that — if they proceed – they are not building a government database.
A task force created by tech executives, entrepreneurs and investors presented a range of ideas around disease mapping and telehealth to the White House during a private meeting Sunday. The discussions included representatives from tech giants; investors led by the New York-based firm Hangar and well-known Silicon Valley venture capitalist Ron Conway; public-health leaders from Harvard University; and smaller telehealth startups like Ro, two sources said.
“We are still in the process of collecting ideas, recommendations, and proposed actions from task-force members, which we intend to present to the White House in the coming days,” said Josh Mendelsohn, the managing partner at Hangar, who helped organize the effort.
Many of those involved either did not respond or declined comment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not respond to a request for comment.

Flight Attendant Working LAX Tests Positive for Coronavirus,"A flight attendant for Korean Air who worked several flights out of Los Angeles International Airport has been diagnosed with coronavirus.
The 24-year-old was diagnosed Tuesday in southern Seoul, according to the Korea Joongang Daily newspaper.
The flight attendant had worked flights between LAX and Seoul–Incheon International Airport on Feb. 19 and 20, according to South Korean media outlets.
The woman also serviced a flight from Tel Aviv, Israel, to Seoul on Feb. 15, South Korea’s Center for Disease Control said. She may have contracted the virus from a South Korean church group who were on a pilgrimage to Israel, the Yonghap News Agency reports.
So far, 30 members of that church group have been diagnosed with coronavirus, according to South Korean health authorities.
Korean Air has closed its operations center at Incheon Airport in order to disinfect the area.

Good News on Coronavirus: High Dose Vitamin C Shows Positive Results In China Hospital,"(CE) Dr. Richard Cheng has been updating everyone via his YouTube channel about vitamin C treatment cases out of China. We have been covering his updates as he is in direct contact with this treatment and isn’t simply an armchair scientist at the moment. We feel in this time this is a very important detail as he is seeing and hearing results first hand, not simply theoretically.
Dr. Cheng was paramount in bringing high dose vitamin C to the table as part of potential treatment and prevention measures. Unfortunately in the West, this option is still being denied by much of mainstream media and governments are not talking about it. Instead, it’s fear and chaos which we do not feel serves anyone to stay healthy or get better. I believe this is a great aspect of this journey to reflect on as it tells us where loyalties lie when it comes to government and pharma. It also illustrates the power of fear and separation culture as opposed to unity.
A group of medical doctors, healthcare providers and scientists met online March 17, 2020, to discuss the use of high dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) in the treatment of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 patients. Dr. Enqian Mao was in attendance, he is the chief of emergency medicine department at Ruijin Hospital, a major hospital in Shanghai, affiliated with the Joatong University College of Medicine. Dr. Mao is also a member of the Senior Expert Team at the Shanghai Public Health Center, where all Covid-19 patients have been treated.
Dr. Mao stated that his group treated about 50 cases of moderate to severe casesof Covid-19 infection with high dose IVC. Dosing of IVC ranged from 10,000 mg – 20,000 mg a day for 7-10 days, with 10,000 mg for moderate cases and 20,000 for more severe cases. The first bit of good news was that all patients who received IVC improved and there was no mortality. Secondly, as compared to the average of a 30-day hospital stay for all Covid-19 patients, those patients who received high dose IVC had a hospital stay about 3-5 days shorter than the overall patients.
Dr. Mao also discussed one particularly severe case where the patient was deteriorating rapidly. An extra of 50,000 mg IVC dosage was given over a period of 4 hours and it caused the patient’s pulmonary (oxygenation index) status to stabilize and improve as the critical care team watched in real time.
Thus far, there were no seen or reported side effects from any of the cases treated with high dose IVC.
Some Thoughts
This strikes me as interesting news because it has been no secret that Vitamin C treatments, and even clinical trials, are happening in China, and yet during a press conference yesterday where the Donald Trump was addressing the American people, Dr. Deborah Birx, part of his COVID-19 task force, talked about how they are watching what other countries are doing, yet there is still no mention of harmless treatments like vitamin C. Only vaccines and ventilators. Ventilators are certainly important for more extreme case patients, but is it really the case that we are to wait for a potentially unsafe and ineffectively vaccine without talking about simple and inexpensive treatment options that could even ease public fear?
Again, this is a reflection for the people, where does government loyalty lie? Perhaps it’s with the industry that spends two times more than what any other lobby does in congress. Would it not be inspiring to see health leaders come on the news and say “Hey, we don’t know for sure if these things will work, just like any other drug or vaccine, but we do know they are harmless if done this way etc.” And then indicate to people how to eat properly, take vitamin C, herbs, and zinc.
To me, this would feel like we truly are pulling out all the stops to unify and help one another, but instead, it feels like another opportunity to push side effect ridden drugs. This is where I feel we can see the need for a shift from a culture of disconnection and scarcity, to one of connection and abundance. Remember, scarcity in our society today is 100% manmade, it is a factor of our economic design, it isn’t real. Think of how banks can get bailed out by printing money out of thin air. This means the same could be done for healthcare, supplements, people’s debt etc, but it isn’t done because the majority need to be financially weaker for the rich to have their cake.
I don’t share this stuff to enrage people, or to judge the leaders, in fact, neither of those two actions will help us in this situation. I say this because it’s the truth and only when we know that can we begin to change our story and what we choose to support. Now is a perfect time for that.

California Gov. Issues “Statewide Order” for Nearly 40 Million Residents to “Stay at Home”,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday evening announced he’s enacting a “statewide order” for its nearly 40 million residents to “stay at home,” a wide-reaching measure for the most populous state in the country as the coronavirus spreads.
The order taking effect midnight on Friday morning. The order prohibits gatherings outside and required nonessential businesses to close. The measure is intended to slow the spread of the virus.
“We need to bend the curve in the state of California,” Newsom said during a news conference. “There’s a social contract here. People, I think, recognize the need to do more. They will adjust and adapt as they have.”
Fox 26 reported the issuance of an order and noted that it gives the city “broad powers” to:
Suspend the sale of firearms and ammo.
Suspend the sale of alcohol.
Order a general curfew.
Order the closing of all taverns.
Order a price or rate freeze on consumer goods and on hotels if lodging is limited.
Order a halt to gasoline sales, except as fuel pumped into vehicles’ gasoline tanks.
Order the closing of any business where crowds “tend to gather,” including theaters, amusement areas, gyms, stadiums, etc.
The Frenso website explains that the emergency declaration allows the prohibition on certain sales–i.e., guns, alcohol, etc.–to be handled by the issuance of separate, subsequent orders. The site says the city may make the subsequent orders “in the interest of public safety and welfare,” and one of those orders would result in “the discontinuance of selling, distributing, dispensing, or giving away of firearms, ammunition or explosive of any character whatsoever.”",,https://realfarmacy.com/cali-statewide-order-stay-home/
"Kid Rock’s Bar Refuses To Close Over Coronavirus, Calls Mandate ‘Unconstitutional’","The owner of Kid Rock‘s Big Ass Honky Tonk Rock N’ Roll Steakhouse in Nashville said he is refusing to follow Mayor John Cooper’s plan to shut down all bars in the city’s tourist hot-spot Lower Broadway during the coronavirus pandemic. After a video of a packed bar went viral overnight, the Metro Board of Health approved a plan to shut down all bars in Davidson County, including the honky-tonks in downtown Nashville. The Tennessee Department of Health reported 39 cases of coronavirus in the state, with 17 in Davidson County alone.
After Cooper announced his plans, Steve Smith, who owns the bar with Kid Rock’s name on it, as well as The Diner and Tootsie’s Orchid Lounge, said he will not follow the rule until a statewide mandate is issued. Smith called the decision “unconstitutional.”
“Unless there’s a statewide mandate that directs all bars and restaurants to be closed, the request made by Mayor Cooper is unconstitutional as he is targeting a select group of businesses,” Smith said in a statement. “We are compassionate with those who have contracted the COVID-19 coronavirus and all who are helping manage the crisis as the entire world addresses the outbreak. However, a Tootsie’s patron as immediate as last night, mentioned having lived through the polio epidemic and didn’t recall such extreme measures being handed down in history.”

Cooper’s plan did not just target bars though. He also set new limits on restaurant capacity, limiting seating to less than 50 percent capacity and limiting total occupancy to 100 people. Bar service at restaurants were also limited to 50 percent capacity with no standing allowed. The Metro Board of Health had an emergency meeting Sunday afternoon to approve the plan, reports The Tennessean.
The decision to close the bars and set limits for restaurants came after a Twitter user shared a video showing a packed bar in Lower Broadway Saturday night, even as people had already been advised to self-quarantine due to the coronavirus. The video quickly went viral, with over 3 million views. It was not a good look for the city, with even celebrities calling out the bars for letting so many customers pack into close quarters.
“While the rest of us are trying to be responsible in our homes and get this s— over with, THIS?!” country singer Maren Morris wrote on Twitter. “Broadway, you aren’t a hero for staying open.”
There are more than 3,400 total confirmed cases of coronavirus in the U.S., and 63 recorded deaths. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday, allowing states and territories access to more funds to limit the spread of the virus.

Jaw-Dropping Video Reveals Where Spring Break “Covidiots” Traveled After Flooding Florida Beaches to Party,"On Monday we reported how thousands of young Americans laughed off warnings to self-isolate and partied on Florida beaches anyway for spring break – with several now testing positive for COVID-19.
The poster child for these selfish ‘covidiots’ – who will statistically survive coronavirus – was a spring breaker from Ohio, Bradley Sluder – told CBS News: “If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I’m not gonna let it stop me from partying,” adding “We’re just out here having a good time. Whatever happens, happens.”

In case you were wondering how far these spring break ‘covidiots’ traveled for their ill-advised debauchery data visualization company Tectonix used cell phone location data collected by company X-Mode to map out the travels of thousands of spring breakers, using special geo-spatial big-data analysis software.
The data – provided by cell phone companies in near real-time, was anonymized.
Watch:
This shows the location data of phones that were on a Florida beach during Spring Break. It then shows where those phones traveled.First thing you should note is the importance of social distancing. The second is how much data your phone gives off. pic.twitter.com/iokUX3qjeB
Amazing.
They turned Lucius Fox's supercomputer from the Dark Knight into real tech. My god.
This kind of data is obviously incredibly useful and has a wide-range of applications. But while the data used is ""anonymized,"" meaning it is not linked to the phone's owner, researchers have found that it is incredibly easy to link the two. https://t.co/UmMej1ZKui

U.S. Suspends Travel From Europe For 30 Days,"On Wednesday night President Trump addressed the nation about specific steps his administration is taking to combat the coronavirus. He announced that he was taking “strong but necessary” actions to protect the public.
All travel from Europe will be suspended for 30 days, beginning on Friday. These restrictions do not apply to the United Kingdom. [Update on UK Travel]
President Trump told the nation:
“For the vast majority of Americans, the risk is very, very low. Young and healthy people can expect to recover fully and quickly if they should get the virus. The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful. In particular we are strongly advising that nursing homes for the elderly suspend all medically unnecessary visits. In general older Americans should also avoid non-essential travel in crowded areas.”
“Smart action today, will prevent the spread of the virus tomorrow,” he emphasized.
President Trump encouraged everyone to practice good hygiene. He said wash your hands and clean often-used surfaces. Cover your face and mouth if you sneeze or cough. He also said those who are feeling unwell should stay home and rest.
Trump went on to explain that he will be asking Congress for financial relief for any workers who are ill, quarantined, or caring for others due to coronavirus. He noted that this is an unprecedented action.
In order to provide extra support for American workers, families, and businesses, Trump said he is instructing the Small Business Administration (SBA) to provide capital and equity to small businesses affected by the coronavirus. He said he is asking Congress for an additional $50 billion for this program so that the SBA can provide low interest loans to business affected by coronavirus.
“We are all in this together. We must put politics aside. Stop the partisanship and unify together as one nation and one family,” he added.

Copper Kills Viruses on Contact,"Even in the world of medicine, what is old is new again.
Thousands of years ago, Egyptians used it to sterilize drinking water. Ancient Romans, Aztecs and Greeks also used it for medical treatments.
I am talking about copper.
The symbol for copper on the periodic chart for elements is Cu. If we are talking about germs that might mean Cu later! (C + u = “See you”)
Copper kills many germs on contact. Now it is back in hospitals to do just that.
One of the major ways we get sick is we touch surfaces out in the world, many made of metal or plastic. These surfaces are covered with germs. Germs live on poles on a train or bus. They are found on doorknobs and handles.
This is especially true in hospitals.
Bill Keevil is a microbiologist at Southampton University in Britain. He is investigating the properties of copper that kill germs — or as researchers call them, pathogens.
Keevil points to studies that compare infection rates at U.S. hospitals that use copper surfaces and those that do not.“They found that copper alloys gave a 58 percent reduction in infection rate. So that showed, you know, that in the real world of a hospital environment, copper alloys do a great job (in preventing infection).”
In a study published in the journal mBio, Keevil and his team found that copper surfaces can quickly kill the coronavirus 229E.
​You may not know coronavirus 229E by name.
But if you ever have had the common cold or the more serious pneumonia, you have been in contact with it.
The coronavirus 229E is also closely related to the pathogen that causes SARS and MERS.
Keevil explains that copper ions — electrically charged molecules — kill dangerous viruses by destroying their genetic material. Copper ions do this by interacting with oxygen and changing the oxygen molecules. As a result, the virus cells cannot mutate.“Now these ions are able to punch holes in the cell’s membrane, enter the cell and destroy their nucleic acid. So they are completely killed. There’s no chance of mutation leading to resistance, and there’s no coming back. So the chemistry is fantastic.”Keevil notes that ancient civilizations knew about the germ-killing properties of copper. However, they may not have understood the science behind it.
Researchers at the U.S. National Institutes of Health wrote on their website about the oldest recorded medical use of copper.
They say its use is noted in an Egyptian medical book written about 4,000 years ago.
The book describes how they used copper to sterilize wounds and drinking water.
Keevil says earlier generations of builders in the United States also knew this about copper. That is why copper alloys such as brass were often used in building materials.
But more modern builders stopped using copper and copper alloys. They cost more than other building materials.
However, Bill Keevil says copper could save hospitals money. He says their other costs of fighting infection will drop, including drugs for treatment.
More importantly, less people will get sick.

These Scientists Insist Coronavirus is NOT a Bioweapon,"A team of researchers including an expert in infectious diseases from Edinburgh University have published a report in the respected journal Nature Medicine exploring the origins of SARS-CoV-2, another name for the feared virus Covid-19. 
Both American and Chinese officials have raised questions about whether the virus was a manmade bioweapon, whilst Trump has dubbed it the “China virus”. 
“By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,” said Kristian Andersen, PhD, an associate professor of immunology and microbiology at Scripps Research and corresponding author on the paper. 
Andrew Rambaut, a member of Edinburgh University’s Institute of Evolutionary Biology, was a co-author on the report.
The team analysed the molecular structure of the virus, which is its “backbone”. 
2/2 CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation! pic.twitter.com/vYNZRFPWo3
They suggested that it cannot be an artificial creation because its structure “differed substantially from those of already known coronaviruses and mostly resembled related viruses found in bats and pangolins”.
The researchers suggested that anyone looking to create a new coronavirus and use it as a bioweapon would probably have built it using the backbone of a virus that has already killed humans. 
“Its distinct backbone rules out laboratory manipulation as a potential origin for SARS-CoV-2,” Andersen added.
However, we still do not know exactly how the coronavirus came into being.

Coronavirus Update: Over 80 People Under Quarantine in New York,"Nassau County health officials are warning residents to remain vigilant as over 80 people remain under voluntary quarantine for possible coronavirus exposure.
The county’s Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Lawrence Eisenstein says 175 residents have had some sort of voluntary isolation from the public, family and friends after traveling to China.
Though there have not been any confirmed cases in the county, or the rest of New York, there are 83 people still under isolation. They must remain under quarantine for 14 days to prevent the possible spread of coronavirus, should they be infected.
“We check in with them every day for their temperature. They’re in communication with us, we’re in communication with them,” Dr. Eisenstein said.
Six people exhibited possible symptoms of the coronavirus – including coughing and a fever. They have all been checked and so far, five Long Islanders have been cleared.
The health department is still awaiting the results of the sixth person.
“We discuss with them the importance of them voluntarily complying with removing themselves from contact with other people, and all of them, to this point, have understood,” the health commissioner said.
All of the hospitals in Nassau County have isolation rooms and while there have not been any mandatory quarantines, Dr. Eisenstein says they are prepared to contain any possible outbreak in New York.
“If somebody were not compliant, we would take next steps. We are prepared for all circumstances,” he says.

San Francisco Orders Residents to Stay Indoors,"Six Bay Area counties announced a “shelter in place” order for all residents on Monday — the strictest measure of its kind in the country — directing everyone to stay inside their homes and away from others as much as possible for the next three weeks as public health officials desperately try to curb the rapid spread of coronavirus across the region.
Bay Area ‘shelter in place’ order: Only essential businesses open in 6 counties with 6.7 million people until April 7
The directive begins at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday and involves San Francisco, Santa Clara, San Mateo, Marin, Contra Costa and Alameda counties — a combined population of more than 6.7 million. It is to stay in place until at least April 7. Three other Bay Area counties — Sonoma, Solano and Napa — were not immediately included.
The order falls just short of a full lockdown, which would forbid people from leaving their homes without explicit permission, and it wasn’t immediately clear how, or to what degree, it would be enforced. The order calls for the sheriff or chief of police to “ensure compliance.” In Italy and other places that have instituted lockdowns, travel outside the home has been restricted without permission and police have been ordering people back home if they don’t have a reason to be in public.
“The scientific evidence shows that at this stage of the (coronavirus) emergency, it is essential to slow virus transmission as much as possible to protect the most vulnerable and to prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed,” the order states. “One proven way to slow the transmission is to limit interactions among people to the greatest extent practicable.”

Pence Task Force Freezes Coronavirus Aid Amid Backlash,"Last week, a Trump administration official working to secure much-needed protective gear for doctors and nurses in the United States had a startling encounter with counterparts in Thailand.
The official asked the Thais for help—only to be informed by the puzzled voices on the other side of the line that a U.S. shipment of the same supplies, the second of two so far, was already on its way to Bangkok.
Trump aides were alarmed when they learned of the exchange, and immediately put the shipment on hold while they ordered a review of U.S. aid procedures. Crossed wires would only confuse our allies, they worried, or worse—offend them. And Americans confronting a surging death toll and shortages of medical equipment back home would likely be outraged.
Vice President Mike Pence soon realized another step was needed: After a phone call asking a foreign leader’s help with key supplies, he ordered his staff to make sure the review process wasn’t holding up coronavirus-related aid to countries that were assisting the United States.
The incidents have spurred the Pence-led coronavirus task force to scrutinize all of USAID’s deliveries to countries requesting personal protective equipment (PPE) needed to fight the outbreak, according to people directly involved in the discussions, causing tensions between aid officials and task-force members.
The administration has also placed a moratorium on overseas shipments of USAID’s stockpiles of protective gear and is asking that the equipment be sent to the U.S. instead, other officials said.

San Francisco Declares State of Emergency Over Coronavirus,"San Francisco Mayor London Breed (D) declared a state of emergency for the city on Tuesday amid concerns over the international coronavirus outbreak.
While no coronavirus cases have been confirmed in San Francisco, “the global picture is changing rapidly, and we need to step-up preparedness,” Breed said in a statement.
“We see the virus spreading in new parts of the world every day, and we are taking the necessary steps to protect San Franciscans from harm,” she added.  
The new state of emergency will allow city officials to assemble resources and personnel to expedite emergency planning measures and boost the ability to deploy a rapid response to a potential coronavirus case in the city.
The move follows a similar declaration from Santa Clara County earlier this month. The declaration is effective immediately for seven days and will be voted on by the board of supervisors on March 3. 
The statement from Breed comes amid stark warnings from U.S. health officials over the chances of an outbreak of the virus in the U.S. 
“As more and more countries experience community spread, successful containment at our borders becomes harder and harder,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday. 
“It’s not a question of if this will happen but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses,” she added. “Disruption to everyday life might be severe.”
More than 77,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in China, where the virus was first detected, but more than 2,000 cases have been identified in other countries. Fifty-seven cases have been confirmed in the U.S., including 40 people who had been repatriated to the country from the Diamond Princess cruise ship.

The Coronavirus Quarantine Drone Footage That Everyone’s Talking About,"Coronavirus drone videos started popping up on YouTube in early February and featured cities in China; and then Europe, particularly Italy.

101-Year-Old Man Who Survived Spanish Flu Recovers From the Coronavirus,"A 101-year-old coronavirus patient in Italy was discharged from the hospital this week. Surviving this illness at his age is quite an accomplishment, but this is not his first pandemic.
The patient, who the hospital identified only as “Mr. P” was born during one of the greatest pandemics in history—the Spanish flu pandemic that killed roughly 50 million people and sickened a quarter of the world’s population.
The man was admitted to Infirmi Hospital in Remini, Italy, last week after testing positive for the virus, but has since made a full and quick recovery.
The man’s recovery was announced by Gloria Lisi, The Vice Mayor of Rimini, in the following statement:
“Given the progress of the virus, it could not even be called a ‘story like many’ if it were not for a detail that makes the life of the person returned to their loved ones truly extraordinary.
Mr. P., from Rimini, was born in 1919, in the midst of another tragic world pandemic. He saw everything, hunger, pain, progress, crisis and resurrections. Once over the 100-year-old barrier, fate has put this new challenge before him, invisible and terrible at the same time. Last week, Mr. P. was hospitalized at in Rimini after testing positive for COVID-19. In a few days, it became ‘history’ for doctors, nurses, and the rest of the healthcare personnel who treated him.
A hope for the future finds itself in the body of a person over a century old, as the sad chronicles of these weeks mechanically tell every day of a virus that is raging especially on the elderly.
Yet, Mr. P. made it. The family brought him home yesterday evening, to teach us that even at 101-years-old, the future has yet to be written.”
While the elderly population does appear to have a more difficult time surviving the virus, there have been a few cases in Italy and China where much older patients were able to recover.
Last week, the Mind Unleashed reported that a 95-year-old woman in Italy made a full recovery from the coronavirus and was discharged from the hospital.
Health officials around the world are now beginning to recognize that this illness is also a grave danger to many young people as well. On Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, said that the Trump administration was “looking very closely” at cases of young people who were hospitalized or lost their lives due to the coronavirus.
Fauci was referencing new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showing that roughly 40 percent of the people who were hospitalized for the illness in the U.S. were between the ages of 20 and 54.

Virus Lingers on Surface for 17 Days…,"Breaking News — Traces of the novel coronavirus (covid-19) were found on surfaces in cruise-ship cabins for as many as 17 days after passengers left, researchers said, though it wasn’t possible to determine whether they caused any infections.
Researchers looked at the rooms of infected passengers aboard the Diamond Princess, both those who showed symptoms and those who didn’t, according to a study Monday in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
The ship, operated by Carnival Corp.’s Princess Cruises, had more than 700 coronavirus cases. It was quarantined for a time off of Yokohama, Japan, and was the largest outbreak outside of mainland China at one point.
A previous analysis found that the virus remained viable on plastic and stainless steel for up to three days, although levels fell dramatically over time. It was less stable on copper, where no viable virus was found after 4 hours, and cardboard, which was clean after 24 hours, according to the report in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The latest study looked at uncleaned rooms, but other research has found that cleaning the rooms of Covid-19 patients was highly effective at killing the virus.

Coronavirus: A Shocking Update. Did The Virus Originate in the US?,"The Western media quickly took the stage and laid out the official narrative for the outbreak of the new coronavirus which appeared to have begun in China, claiming it to have originated with animals at a wet market in Wuhan.
In fact the origin was for a long time unknown but it appears likely now, according to Chinese and Japanese reports, that the virus originated elsewhere, from multiple locations, but began to spread widely only after being introduced to the market.
More to the point, it appears that the virus did not originate in China and, according to reports in Japanese and other media, may have originated in the US.

Chinese Researchers Conclude the Virus Originated Outside of China
After collecting samples of the genome in China, medical researchers first conclusively demonstrated that the virus did not originate at the seafood market but had multiple unidentified sources, after which it was exposed to the seafood market from where it spread everywhere. (1) (2) (3)
According to the Global Times:
A new study by Chinese researchers indicates the novel coronavirus may have begun human-to-human transmission in late November from a place other than the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
The study published on ChinaXiv, a Chinese open repository for scientific researchers, reveals the new coronavirus was introduced to the seafood market from another location(s), and then spread rapidly from the market due to the large number of close contacts. The findings were the result of analyses of the genome data, sources of infection, and the route of spread of variations of the novel coronavirus collected throughout China.
The study believes that patient(s) zero transmitted the virus to workers or sellers at the Huanan seafood market, the crowded market easily facilitating further transmission of the virus to buyers, which caused a wider spread in early December 2019. (Global Times, February 22, 2020, emphasis added (2)
Chinese medical authorities – and “intelligence agencies” – then conducted a rapid and wide-ranging search for the origin of the virus, collecting nearly 100 samples of the genome from 12 different countries on 4 continents, identifying all the varieties and mutations. During this research, they determined the virus outbreak had begun much earlier, probably in November, shortly after the Wuhan Military Games.
They then came to the same independent conclusions as the Japanese researchers – that the virus did not begin in China but was introduced there from the outside.
China’s top respiratory specialist Zhong Nanshan  said on January 27
“Though the COVID-19 was first discovered in China, it does not mean that it originated from China”
“But that is Chinese for “it originated someplace else, in another country”. (4)
This of course raises questions as to the actual location of origin. If the authorities pursued their analysis through 100 genome samples from 12 countries, they must have had a compelling reason to be searching for the original source outside China. This would explain why there was such difficulty in locating and identifying a ‘patient zero’.
Japan’s Media: The Coronavirus May Have Originated in the US
In February of 2020, the Japanese Asahi news report (print and TV) claimed the coronavirus originated in the US, not in China, and that some (or many) of the 14,000 American deaths attributed to influenza may have in fact have resulted from the coronavirus. (5)
A report from a Japanese TV station disclosing a suspicion that some of those Americans may have unknowningly contracted the coronavirus has gone viral on Chinese social media, stoking fears and speculations in China that the novel coronavirus may have originated in the US.
The report, by TV Asahi Corporation of Japan, suggested that the US government may have failed to grasp how rampant the virus has gone on US soil.
However, it is unknown whether Americans who have already died of the influenza had contracted the coronavirus, as reported by TV Asahi. (People’s Daily, English, February 23, 2020, emphasis added)
On February 14, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said they will begin to test individuals with influenza-like-illness for the novel coronavirus at public health labs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, and New York City.
The TV Asahi network presented scientific documentation for their claims, raising the issue that no one would know the cause of death because the US either neglected to test or failed to release the results. Japan avoided the questions of natural vs. man-made and accidental vs. deliberate, simply stating that the virus outbreak may first have occurred in the US. The Western Internet appears to have been scrubbed of this information, but the Chinese media still reference it.
These claims stirred up a hornet’s nest not only in Japan but in China, immediately going viral on Chinese social media, especially since the Military World Games were held in Wuhan in October, and it had already been widely discussed that the virus could have been transmitted at that time – from a foreign source.
“Perhaps the US delegates brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, and some mutation occurred to the virus, making it more deadly and contagious, and causing a widespread outbreak this year.” (People’s Daily, February 23, 2020) (1)
Shen Yi, an international relations professor at Shanghai’s Fudan University, stated that global virologists “including the intelligence agencies” were tracking the origin of the virus. Also of interest, the Chinese government did not shut the door on this. The news report stated:
“Netizens are encouraged to actively partake in discussions, but preferably in a rational fashion.”
In China, that is meaningful. If the reports were rubbish, the government would clearly state that, and tell people to not spread false rumors.
Taiwan Virologist Suggests the Coronavirus Originated in the US
Then, Taiwan ran a TV news program on February,27,(click here to access video (Chinese), that presented diagrams and flow charts suggesting the coronavirus originated in the US. (6)
Below is a rough translation, summary and analysis of selected content of that newscast. (see map below)
The man in the video is a top virologist and pharmacologist who performed a long and detailed search for the source of the virus. He spends the first part of the video explaining the various haplotypes (varieties, if you will), and explains how they are related to each other, how one must have come before another, and how one type derived from another. He explains this is merely elementary science and nothing to do with geopolitical issues, describing how, just as with numbers in order, 3 must always follow 2.
One of his main points is that the type infecting Taiwan exists only in Australia and the US and, since Taiwan was not infected by Australians, the infection in Taiwan could have come only from the US.
The basic logic is that the geographical location with the greatest diversity of virus strains must be the original source because a single strain cannot emerge from nothing. He demonstrated that only the US has all the five known strains of the virus (while Wuhan and most of China have only one, as do Taiwan and South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, Singapore, and England, Belgium and Germany), constituting a thesis that the haplotypes in other nations may have originated in the US.
Korea and Taiwan have a different haplotype of the virus than China, perhaps more infective but much less deadly, which would account for a death rate only 1/3 that of China.
Neither Iran nor Italy were included in the above tests, but both countries have now deciphered the locally prevalent genome and have declared them of different varieties from those in China, which means they did not originate in China but were of necessity introduced from another source. It is worth noting that the variety in Italy has approximately the same fatality rate as that of China, three times as great as other nations, while the haplotype in Iran appears to be the deadliest with a fatality rate of between 10% and 25%. (7) (8) (9)
Due to the enormous amount of Western media coverage focused on China, much of the world believes the coronavirus spread to all other nations from China, but this now appears to have been proven wrong. With about 50 nations scattered throughout the world having identified at least one case at the time of writing, it would be very interesting to examine virus samples from each of those nations to determine their location of origin and the worldwide sources and patterns of spread.
The Virologist further stated that the US has recently had more than 200 “pulmonary fibrosis” cases that resulted in death due to patients’ inability to breathe, but whose conditions and symptoms could not be explained by pulmonary fibrosis. He said he wrote articles informing the US health authorities to consider seriously those deaths as resulting from the coronavirus, but they responded by blaming the deaths on e-cigarettes, then silenced further discussion. …
[READ: Bioweapons Expert Speaks Out About Coronavirus]
The Taiwanese doctor then stated the virus outbreak began earlier than assumed, saying, “We must look to September of 2019”.
He stated the case in September of 2019 where some Japanese traveled to Hawaii and returned home infected, people who had never been to China. This was two months prior to the infections in China and just after the CDC suddenly and totally shut down the Fort Detrick bio-weapons lab claiming the facilities were insufficient to prevent loss of pathogens. (10) (11)
He said he personally investigated those cases very carefully (as did the Japanese virologists who came to the same conclusion).. This might indicate the coronavirus had already spread in the US but where the symptoms were being officially attributed to other diseases, and thus possibly masked.
The prominent Chinese news website Huanqiu related one case in the US where a woman’s relative was told by physicians he died of the flu, but where the death certificate listed the coronavirus as the cause of death. On February 26, ABC News affiliate KJCT8 News Network reported that a woman recently told the media that her sister died on from coronavirus infection. Montrose, Colorado resident Almeta Stone said, “They (the medical staff) kept us informed that it was the flu, and when I got the death certificate, there was a coronavirus in the cause of death.” (12) We cannot ascertain the number of such cases in the US but since the CDC apparently has no reliable test kits and is conducting little or no testing for the virus, there may be others.***
Just for information
In the past two years (during the trade war) China has suffered several pandemics:
February 15, 2018: H7N4 bird flu. Sickened at least 1,600 people in China and killed more than 600. Many chickens killed. China needs to purchase US poultry products.
June, 2018: H7N9 bird flu. Many chickens killed. China needs to purchase US poultry products.
August, 2018: outbreak of African swine flu. Same strain as Russia, from Georgia. Millions of pigs killed. China needs to purchase US pork products.
May 24, 2019: massive infestation of armyworms in 14 province-level regions in China, which destroy most food crops. Quickly spread to more than 8,500 hectares of China’s grain production. They produce astonishing numbers of eggs. China needs to purchase US agricultural products – corn, soybeans.
December, 2019: Coronavirus appearance puts China’s economy on hold.
January, 2020: China is hit by a “highly pathogenic” strain of bird flu in Hunan province. Many chickens died, many others killed. China needs to purchase US poultry products.
The standard adage is that bad luck happens in threes, not sixes.

"$1,000 Bonus for Every Adult Citizen? $500 for Every Child…","Now that the Federal Reserve has fired its monetary policy bazooka — announcing Sunday the second emergency interest rate cut in as many weeks, this one taking rates effectively to zero — expect the drumbeat for fiscal stimulus to pick up, as more economists pound the table for government action.
What’s happening: On Monday, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) joined a growing chorus of liberal and conservative economists are lining up behind a proposal published in the Wall Street Journal by Harvard professor Jason Furman, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) under President Obama, that calls for direct government payments of $1,000 to every American adult.
Romney said that the idea would “help ensure families and workers can meet their short-term obligations and increase spending in the economy.”
What it means: Furman proposes Congress pass a “one-time payment of $1,000 to every adult who is a U.S. citizen or a taxpaying U.S. resident, and $500 to every child who meets the same criteria.” 
He adds that the law “should also specify that the payments would continue in 2021 and beyond if the unemployment rate rises to 5.5% and remains there or higher. Hopefully this will not happen, but if it does, the money will be needed.”
“The comprehensive and dynamic response should also include extensions of unemployment insurance and increased Medicaid matching for states. These would be passed pre-emptively, so that they could trigger automatically in states where unemployment rates rise.”
The proposal for direct payments to households also has been backed by noted conservatives Michael R. Strain and Scott Gottlieb of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, who advocate for direct payments that are “temporary and only for states experiencing severe outbreaks.”
Why it matters: Market watchers of all stripes agree that the Fed’s tools alone are insufficient to counter the damage likely to be done to the U.S. economy from the coronavirus outbreak and shutdown of businesses that has already begun. 
Fed chair Jerome Powell admitted as much during his press conference Sunday, saying,”We don’t have the tools to reach individuals and particularly small businesses and other businesses and people who may be out of work.”
“I think fiscal policy is a way to direct relief to particular populations and groups … we do think fiscal responses are critical.”
The bottom line: “The issue is not aggregate demand but social insurance,” N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economics professor who served as CEA chair under George W. Bush, told Axios in an email Thursday.

"France Deploys 100,000 Police to Enforce Lockdown","PARIS, March 16 – President Emmanuel Macron ordered 100,000 police be deployed to enforce a lockdown aimed at curbing the coronavirus outbreak, the country’s interior minister said on Monday, and fixed checkpoints will be set up across the country.
“Stay at home,” Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said, adding that fines of up to 135 euros would be handed out to those flouting the toughened restrictions.
In a sombre address to the nation, Macron said that from Tuesday midday (1100 GMT) people should stay at home unless it was to buy groceries, travel to work, exercise or for medical care. (Reporting by Richard Lough; Editing by Sandra Maler)

"Convicted Rapist Harvey Weinstein Tests Positive for Coronavirus in Prison, Transferred…","Mere days after being transferred to the Wende Correctional Facility from NYC’s Rikers Island, the Oscar winning producer and convicted rapist, Harvey Weinstein is now in medical isolation after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, an Empire State law enforcement official confirmed.
Under the policy that they “cannot comment on an individual’s medical record,” New York State’s Department of Corrections representatives did not respond to request for direct confirmation. “Our team …has not heard anything like that yet,” said Weinstein PR chief Juda Engelmayer on Sunday. “I can’t tell you what I don’t know,” the producer’s personal rep added.
Moved to Wende on March 18, the just turned 68 years old Weinstein is one of two prisoners at the 961 capacity maximum security facility just east of Buffalo who was put in isolation after testing positive for the coronavirus.
As the global pandemic spreads and surges, New York state has taken the biggest hit domestically of the ever expanding coronavirus. To that, he more than 43,000 prisoners in the state’s already over burdened system are increasingly seen as a high risk category. Already around 40 inmates at Rikers have reportedly been found positive for COVID-19 in the past week, coinciding with Weinstein’s time in that NYC Hellhole.
It is unclear if Weinstein himself contracted the disease at the East River complex or when he was in hospital in Manhattan over the past few weeks.

‘I’m a 42-Year-Old Woman Who Got the Novel Coronavirus. This Is What It Has Been Like.’,"Contracting Coronavirus at a Restaurant
An anonymous 42-year-old woman shared her story of testing positive for COVID-19 with Women’s Health. Her family’s experience with coronavirus offers insight into what it’s like to contract the illness, as well as what it takes to avoid infecting anyone else. (1)
The woman, who lives near Seattle, Washington, believes she caught the virus at a restaurant on Tuesday, February 25. She was at lunch with seven other people, and the group later learned that one of them had been infected with COVID-19. But during the lunch, that person hadn’t started showing symptoms yet. The woman who shared her story, as well as two other people from her group, were all showing symptoms by that Friday. (1)
According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), common symptoms of coronavirus are cough, fever, and shortness of breath. These symptoms may arise between 2-14 days after you’re exposed to the virus. Symptoms may be mild and resemble a cold or allergies. (2)
There are also symptoms that signal a serious case of COVID-19. More serious warning signs, which require immediate medical attention include: (2)
shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
bluish face or lips
showing confusion or unable to be roused
consistent pressure or pain in the chest
The woman said that she woke up with a headache and a sore throat. Fortunately, she works from home, but she felt so sick by noon that she stopped working. By early afternoon, the woman had a fever of 100.2°F, as well as body aches and chills. Thinking that she had the flu, the woman got into bed around 3 pm and stayed there until the next day. (1)
Testing Positive for the New Coronavirus
When this woman first got sick, she had only heard of one confirmed case of COVID-19 in the Seattle area. This person didn’t have any connections to people who had recently traveled overseas, so authorities suspected they had contracted the virus through community spread. (1)
The woman visited a clinic on Saturday, February 29 and received Tamiflu, which treats flu symptoms. She began to suspect that she could have the new coronavirus, so she called the nurse she saw at the clinic and asked about getting tested. At that point, coronavirus tests were in short supply, and the nurse told her that she didn’t meet the testing requirements. (1)
However, the nurse suggested that the woman enroll in the Seattle Flu Study online. This research project sends qualified participants a testing kit. Participants swab their nose and send it back to the study. (1)
The woman sent in her sample and received a call on Friday, March 6. The woman on the phone told her she had tested positive for COVID-19. (1)
Self-Quarantining with a Family
To keep her husband and two children safe, the woman decided to self-quarantine in her bedroom, not seeing anyone for the first 72 hours she was sick. She believes that this kept her family from contracting the virus. Her husband has since tested negative for the new coronavirus, and her children will only get tested if they show symptoms. (1)
The health department recommended that the family self-quarantine for 14 days to make sure they don’t develop any symptoms. They pass the time with “Clorox wiping-down parties”, cleaning doorknobs and other spots that they frequently touch. (1)
Most difficult, the woman said, was calling everyone she had come into contact with after contracting COVID-19. But people have thanked her for informing them, and many people in her community have offered to help by dropping off groceries and other supplies. (1)
Because of the stigma surrounding this new coronavirus, the woman chose to remain anonymous while sharing her story. According to the CDC’s website, “Stigma affects the emotional or mental health of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.” They recommend countering stigma during the COVID-19 outbreak by: (1, 3)
speaking out against stereotyping and stigmatizing specific groups of people.
sharing accurate information about COVID-19 and the way it spreads.
communicating with stigmatized groups in person and through social media.
Reducing the stigma around COVID-19 will allow people to be honest about their experiences and get the treatment they need. Stories like the one this woman shared are so valuable as we learn how to fight this new virus. (1)

"Five States Close Bars, Restaurants and More, in Effort to Slow Coronavirus","The governors in five states — California, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington — closed bars, restaurants and wineries in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus. In other parts of the country, mayors of major cities ordered similar restrictions.
In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine said bars and restaurants can stay open for carry-out and delivery but “what we can’t have is people congregating and seated.”
“I’m aware that this will impact many, many good workers,” DeWine wrote on Twitter. “I can’t tell you how sorry I am, but we will work to mitigate the suffering. It is our goal for everyone to get through this.
“Every day we delay, more people will die.” 
In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom said all bars, wineries, brew pubs and nightclubs should close, and asked that those over 65 self-isolate. A few hours after Newsom’s suggestion, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he was closing bars, restaurants (except for take out and delivery), nightclubs and “entertainment venues,” effective at midnight Sunday until at least March 31.

"“This Is WRONG!” Utah Doctor Unable to Prescribe Hydroxychloroquine, but State Refutes claim…","A doctor in Utah has complained on social media that state bureaucrats are blocking him from prescribing medicine to coronavirus patients.
@DrBill_MD_ on Twitter explained that “I am a licensed physician in Utah. I tried to prescribe hydroxychloroquine but the pharmacist said the state had taken over the distribution of the drug. Even though I’m licensed, I cannot prescribe it. This is WRONG!”
I am a licensed physician in Utah. I tried to prescribe hydroxychloroquine but the pharmacist said the state had taken over the distribution of the drug. Even though I’m licensed, I cannot prescribe it. This is WRONG!
I would like to believe that those officials who are preventing the use of hydroxychloroquine azirhromycin are airing on the side of caution and not being jerks! But man, we’re in the middle of an epidemic! We need to be a little liberal with the rules
Lately, it has become a common theme in pop culture and network news to criticize the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 after it was touted by President Trump as a “potential game-changer.” @DrBill_MD_ is apparently implying that his inability to prescribe the drug is being caused by political partisan. He is hopeful this is not the root cause.
Folks question why Fauci cheered using drug for MERS coronavirus in 2013… but now he’s skeptical https://t.co/3VHmtsZZJB
The anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine is apparently effective in treating those afflicted with the novel coronavirus. The drug is a synthetic version of quinine, the centuries old treatment for malaria that comes from the bark of the cinchona tree.
“Every patient I've prescribed it to has been very, very ill and within 8 to 12 hours, they were basically symptom-free,"" Dr. Anthony Cardillo told Eyewitness News in Los Angeles. ""So clinically I am seeing a resolution."" https://t.co/eTaxQmQfGk
Hydroxychloroquine is sometimes sold under the brand name Plaquenil and is commonly prescribed to those with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.
Chloroquine has activity against a number of viruses in vitro and in vivo including flaviviruses (dengue virus), Togaviruses (chikungunya virus), paramyxoviruses (Hendra, Nipah virus), influenza viruses, HIV, and filoviruses (Ebola virus). -From the 2017 Study, MERS and SARS: Current Therapeutic Options and Potential Targets for Novel Therapies
The quote above comes from a study published in November of 2017 in the journal, Drugs. It goes on to point out that,
“Importantly, hydroxychloroquine, a chloroquine derivate, may provide an alternative due to lower toxicity and similar pharmacology profile.”
There are many other similar published studies that can be freely accessed through the US National Library of Medicine and National Institutes of Health’s public library.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients on an experimental basis. Clinical trials are underway in New York. 
There have also been some reports from around the country and around the world of good outcomes with hydroxychloroquine and companion drug Azithromycin.
Some Doctors in New York and China are also using Vitamin C intravenously as well as Zinc Sulfate.

US Intelligence Finds China Faked Death Toll and Impact of Coronavirus,"China has intentionally fabricated the number of coronavirus cases and deaths that the country suffered, according to a new report.
The country faked numbers on purpose, the American intelligence community concluded in a classified report given to the White House last week, Bloomberg News reported, citing three U.S. officials.
“China’s public reporting on cases and deaths is intentionally incomplete,” the outlet reported. “Two of the officials said the report concludes that China’s numbers are fake.”
As of Wednesday, China — the epicenter of the global pandemic — has claimed to have under 83,000 cases and around 3,300 deaths.
That’s significantly less than the U.S., which as reported more than 200,000, or Italy with 110,000, or Spain with 102,000.
In recent weeks, Wuhan has reported no new cases almost every day, a drop from the thousands it reported every day until mid-February, and the hundreds into early March.
Deborah Birx, the State Department immunologist on the Coronavirus Task Force, said on Tuesday that China’s data was interpreted by the medical community as: “This was serious, but smaller than anyone expected.”
“Because I think probably we were missing a significant amount of the data, now that we see what happened to Italy and see what happened to Spain.”

Colorado Confirms First Case of Coronavirus,"A man in his 30s visiting Summit County from out of state has tested positive for coronavirus, sweeping the globe has made it to Colorado.
State health officials said the patient has “known exposure” through close contact with a person who has COVID-19, the virus’s formal name, outside of Colorado.
Gov. Jared Polis and state health officials plan to provide more information at a 4:45 p.m news conference.
No specific treatment is available for the virus, so care for people with mild cases mostly involves medication to reduce fevers, rest and plenty of fluids. People who develop pneumonia, one of the most common complications, may need oxygen or to be placed on a ventilator.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s state lab can test about 160 samples per day, with results in 24 hours.
It’s not clear how long the virus could have circulated in Colorado and other states without being detected, because a study estimated it spread undetected in the Seattle area for as long as six weeks. There is no known link between the first patient in Washington, who traveled to China, and other people who became seriously ill, suggesting that people with mild or no symptoms unknowingly spread the virus as they went about their daily lives.
As of Thursday, 163 cases and 11 deaths from the new virus, known as COVID-19, have been confirmed in the United States. The virus got a slow start in the United States, with just a few people who were infected when they traveled to China, but has begun to spread in California, Florida and Washington state.
Most of the deaths so far have been in Washington, where an outbreak at a nursing home put medically vulnerable people at risk.
Worldwide, the virus infected about 97,700 people as of Thursday, according to The New York Times. About 3,300 have died. The CDC has advised people to avoid nonessential travel to China, South Korea, Iran and Italy because the virus is circulating widely in those countries. People who are at a higher risk of complications also should avoid travel to Japan.

10 Big Mistakes You Are Making With Face Masks,"You’re Cross-Contaminating
“Once you wear a mask once, it’s contaminated by whatever. If you take the mask off and sit it on another surface, that surface is now contaminated,” says Geoffrey Mount Varner, MD, MPH, FACEP, a Maryland-based emergency medicine physician.
The Rx: “It’s best to use one-use masks and once they are taken off, dispose of them,” says Mount Varner. “If you use a cloth or hand-made mask, it needs to be washed and sanitized between wears.”
You’re Wearing the Same Mask All Day
“A mask should be changed or disinfected as often as every 2 hours, otherwise viral particles can accumulate on it and you are more likely to breathe them in,” says Marinov.
You’re Touching the Mask With Dirty Hands
“If you contaminate your mask even from the outside, you can get easily infected,” says physician Dimitar Marinov, MD, Ph.D.
“Taking off your face mask and then reapplying it with contaminated hands can move the bacteria or virus directly into the breathable area,” says Jared Heathman, MD, a Texas-based psychiatrist.
The Rx: Make sure your hands are clean before adjusting the mask. It’s best to avoid touching your face in general.
You’re Not Fully Covered
“I see many people wearing their masks below the nose,” says Marinov. “While it will still protect others if you are coughing or sneezing, it will not protect you from COVID-19 if someone else nearby is infected and coughs.”
The Rx: Once the mask is fitted properly on the nose, it should be extended so that it fits right under your chin, says Angela Abernathy, a New York City-based dentist. “This is to ensure maximum coverage.”
Adds Heathman: “The purpose is to breathe through the mask, not around the mask.”
You’re Putting It on Too Late
Without the mask, you’re susceptible to inhaling the particles in the air. “You must put it on ahead of entering an area of risk,” says Rafael Lugo, a general surgeon and owner/CEO at Lugo Surgical Group in The Woodlands, Texas. 
You’re Too Trusting
You may think “the mask is 100 percent reliable,” says Lugo. Not so. “It is meant to decrease the risk. Ultimately, social distancing is king.”
“A surgical mask is not designed to provide a barrier between your respiratory system and all viruses and bacteria,” says Leann Poston, MD, a physician with Invigor Medical in New York City. “Social distancing helps protect you from viral particles sneezed and coughed into the air by people who may not know that they are sick yet.”
You’re Spraying It With Chemicals
“Applying any chemical like Lysol to the mask that makes it wet is bad,” says Lugo. “You can spray it to sanitize lightly, and then put it in a bag. Do not saturate it.”
You’re Getting the Mask Wet
“Once the mask becomes wet, it becomes less effective and needs to be changed to a dry one,” says Abernathy. Avoid touching the mask with your tongue. “Touching the mask with your tongue makes it wet and more porous,” advises Lugo. “You want the mask to stay dry.”
You’re Wearing It Wrong
“Masks have a front (that is usually colored, textured or has the brand name) and a back (that is usually white and more cotton-like),” says Abernathy. “The back side should be touching your face. It is designed this way so that particles are properly filtered.”
You Think All Masks Are the Same
Different masks have different uses. “An N95 mask filters out 95% of bacteria and viruses if they are correctly fitted to your face,” says Poston. This is what healthcare workers are using to better protect themselves when caring for sick patients. “A surgical mask is designed to contain your droplets to help protect those around you.”

Mexico Considers Closing Border to Stop Americans From Entering,"In an interesting turn of events, Mexican health officials are considering closing off the country’s northern border with the United States amid the growing coronavirus outbreak.
In the debate surrounding travel across the U.S.-Mexico border, the roles are usually reversed with U.S. officials threatening to shut down the border over immigration and security concerns despite the fact that more people are actually moving from the United States to Mexico than the other way around.
Mexican health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell voiced his concerns about the risk of the outbreak spreading from the United States at a press conference on Friday.
“Mexico wouldn’t bring the virus to the United States, rather the United States would bring it here. The possible flow of coronavirus would come from the north to the south. If it were technically necessary, we would consider mechanisms of restriction or stronger surveillance,” Lopez-Gatell said.
The official number of cases in the U.S. is just over 2,300, but some experts and health officials believe that there are already hundreds of thousands of cases. Dr. Marty Makary, a medical professor at Johns Hopkins University, estimates that there could be up to a half-million cases in the U.S.
“Don’t believe the numbers when you see, even on our Johns Hopkins website, that 1,600 Americans have the virus. No, that means 1,600 got the test, tested positive. There are probably 25 to 50 people who have the virus for every one person who is confirmed,” Makary said.
“I think we have between 50,000 and half a million cases right now walking around in the United States,” he added.
Meanwhile, Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton estimated that there were at least 100,000 undiagnosed cases just in the state of Ohio.
“We know now, just the fact of community spread, says that at least 1 percent, at the very least, 1 percent of our population is carrying this virus in Ohio today. We have 11.7 million people. So the math is over 100,000. So that just gives you a sense of how this virus spreads and is spreading quickly,” Acton said.
There are still under 20 confirmed cases in Mexico, and no known deaths from the illness, although as with the U.S. and everywhere else, this number is likely to be higher due to inadequate testing.

Bioweapons Expert Speaks Out About Coronavirus,"As you know, a novel coronavirus (initially labeled 2019-nCOV before being renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization1) originating in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, is rapidly spreading across the world. 
The first case was reported in Wuhan on December 21, 2019. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, severe cough and pneumonia which, in more severe cases, can lead to impaired kidney and liver function and kidney failure.2,3
On January 21, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case4 — a patient in Washington state who had recently visited Wuhan. Then, the first U.S. death was reported February 29, 2020, in Washington state.5
Less than a week later, CBS News reported March 5, 2020, that the number of deaths had quickly risen to 11 nationwide in the U.S. — 10 in Washington state and one in California.6 Not only that, but as of that day, “The World Health Organization urged governments around the world to pull out ‘all the stops’” to fight the outbreak. On the up side, China “appeared to be over the worst” of it, CBS said.
All told, as of March 5, 2020, there were 98,067 reported cases of novel coronavirus infections affecting 88 countries, 80,430 of which were in China. Worldometer.info provides an easy overview of confirmed cases and deaths that you can check for the latest statistics.7
COVID-19 — A Weaponized Coronavirus?
In this interview, Francis Boyle — whose background includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago, a juris doctor (lawyer) degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in political science — shares his theory of the origin of this novel coronavirus. 
For decades, he’s advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, which he suspects COVID-19 is. In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr.
At the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50,000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup. 
As a result of Boyle’s antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration — a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons — Boyle has carefully followed “mysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world” that have appeared since then. 
“My biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted. 
Even though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,” Boyle says. 
“So, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me. 
There is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It’s the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus. 
There have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons. 
For that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility … maybe mid-November … and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.” 
Many Unknowns Remain
The first reported case of COVID-19 infection was December 1, 2019. Depending on the incubation period, which is still unknown, the initial lead, provided there was one, might have occurred anywhere in November. The official estimate is a 14-day incubation period, but a British health expert believes it’s 24 days, and North Korean biological warfare experts believe it’s 30 days, Boyle says.
“As for Wuhan and Hubei Province, they’re basically under martial law. There’s no other word for it. If you read the statements by President Xi and his assistants, they’ve made it very clear they’re at war here, and that is correct. They’re at war with their own biological warfare agent. 
President Xi just fired the party apparatchiks in charge of this and has brought in trusted military personnel to handle it, as well as large numbers of PLA [People’s Liberation Army] forces saying they’re health care workers. They don’t look like health care workers to me. So, as of now, that’s my best reading of the situation.”
When asked about rumors the COVID-19 virus might have been stolen from a high-security laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, Boyle says:
“It could have been. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion they were already working on that at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility. They were working on a biological warfare weapon involving SARS, which is a coronavirus to begin with. 
We do know that Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin … resurrected the Spanish flu virus for the Pentagon, obviously for weapons purposes, and he specializes in mating the Spanish flu virus to all sorts of hideous biowarfare instrumentalities. And there was a record of him shipping his products to Winnipeg. 
Winnipeg is Canada’s equivalent of our own Fort Detrick. It’s a BSL-4 facility, and yes, they research, develop tests, manufacture and stockpile every type of hideous biological warfare weapon that we know of. So, some of this technology could have been stolen from Winnipeg. I don’t know about that but, as I said, the Wuhan BSL-4 was already working on this to begin with. 
They had already developed SARS. SARS had leaked out two to three times before this, and it seems they were turbocharging SARS, which is what [COVID-19] looks to be. This is a brand-new generation of biowarfare weapons we haven’t seen before. 
Its lethality goes from 15%, as estimated by Lancet, up to 17% to 18% by a British health official and even Chinese statistics. Its infectivity is 83%. It can infect maybe three to four people for every person infected. 
It has gain of function properties, which means it travels through air at least 6 or 7 feet, and … there are reports that even contaminated human feces give it off, that the human feces radiate off maybe 6 or 7 feet. So, we’ve never seen anything like this before in the history of biological warfare, at least in the public record.
I want to make it clear: I have never worked for the United States government. I’ve never had a security clearance. I’ve never had access to any type of secret information. 
I just read what is in the public record and the scientific record and try to draw my own conclusions, and that’s what I’m giving you today. I could change my opinion if people can provide me reputable scientific evidence to the contrary.
Right now, I’m standing by my conclusion that it leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4, the highest level of the Chinese government has known about it, they’ve been covering it up from the get-go, until they informed the WHO at the end of December.”
Despite Laws, Biowarfare Experimentation Is Alive and Well
As noted by Boyle, the Wuhan lab is a designated WHO research lab, which may sound odd, considering these facilities specialize in developing and researching dangerous pathogens that can easily be turned into bioweapons. 
According to Boyle, we should not be surprised however, as “WHO is up to its eyeballs in this type of work and has been for quite some time.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the drug industry also appear to have had their hand in many of the outbreaks of what appear to be weaponized viruses. 
“I won’t go through the long history of big pharma getting involved in this. There’s huge amounts of money here. I believe the West Africa Ebola pandemic originated out of the US BSL-4 facility in Sierra Leone, and [that] they were testing out a so-called vaccine that contained live Ebola and gave it to these poor people,” Boyle says. 
“As for the CDC, it has been involved in every … BSL-4 biological warfare death science you could possibly imagine … It’s a matter of public record that during the Reagan administration, the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection sent 40 shipments of weapons-grade biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these agents and use them against Iran …
Of course, the problem is that when that war was over … an order was given to U.S. military forces to blow up Saddam Hussein’s biological warfare facilities, and that’s not how you deal with biological warfare weapons … 
[It] contaminated our own troops, and that was a causative factor in the Gulf War Syndrome that … murdered about 11,000 U.S. troops and disabled about 100,000.”
According to Boyle, the U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015, which is no small sum. To put it into perspective, the U.S. spent $40 billion (assuming a constant dollar value) on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Boyle also estimates the U.S. has some 13,000 life scientists working within the biowarfare industry. 
“Clearly, the Reagan administration, under the influence of its neoconservatives who definitely believe in biological weapons and ethnic-specific biological weapons (you can see that in the PNAC report), were engaged in the use of DNA genetic engineering for the purpose of manufacturing biological weapons. 
That is why I gave a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. in 1985. I was asked to do that by the Council for Responsible Genetics that I work with, which involves the leading life scientists in the world from MIT and Harvard. 
I spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees and I knew all these people. They asked me to serve as their lawyer and give this Congressional briefing. I blew the whistle, and then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation, which I did …
I want to make it clear I’m not here to speak in their name, I’m only speaking in my name, but if you look at my book, ‘Biological Warfare and Terrorism,’ professor Jonathan King wrote the foreword. So, I have the leading MIT professor of molecular biology supporting what I’m saying, if you don’t think I know enough science about it.”
US Prepares for COVID-19 Pandemic
While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans,8 should the situation take a turn for the worse. 
Historically speaking, however, government health officials have been vastly exaggerating the threat of pandemics in the U.S., including the bird flu, the swine flu, anthrax and Ebola. 
For example, as detailed in my 2009 New York Times bestseller “The Great Bird Flu Hoax,” then-President George Bush Jr. projected 2 million Americans would die from bird flu; the best-case scenario taking only 200,000 lives. The final death count in the U.S. from that pandemic was zero. 
It generated massive profits, though, as U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to purchase 20 million doses of Tamiflu. One of the people who was able to line his pockets from that hoax was defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was president of Gilead Sciences when the drug was created.
“[The bird flu] was another DNA, genetically engineered biological warfare weapon,” Boyle notes. “It was a chimera. It had three different elements in it and we were all lucky that somehow they attenuated the lethality and the infectiveness of the bird flu.”
Whether or not COVID-19 will be similarly ineffective in its spread and lethality remains to be seen. Judging by the statistics in China, “it doesn’t look very good,” Boyle says. 
Understanding the COVID-19 Virus
According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera, like the avian flu virus before it. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material. “That was in a published article by Indian scientists. You could see the pictures right there, [but] political pressure was brought to bear upon them so they withdrew [the paper].” 
This is why some scientists are now looking into using HIV drugs to treat it,9 Boyle says. COVID-19 may also have a flu virus mixed in, along with gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal. 
Pandemics Repeatedly Used to Further Police State
Pandemics have also been used to chip away public freedoms. For example, the anthrax scare of 2001 was used as the impetus for signing the Patriot Act, which was the first step in taking away many of our personal freedoms and rolling out a complete surveillance state. To me, such outcomes are far more concerning than the risk of infection itself. Boyle adds:
“They used Amerithrax to ram the Patriot Act through, that is correct … We became a police state … And as I pointed out in ‘Biowarfare and Terrorism,’ I think the same people who were behind the 9/11 terrorist attack were also behind the Amerithrax, but I’m just connecting dots there …
What’s called Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare weapons lab and program, and I publicly blew the whistle on that the first weekend of November 2001. 
The Council for Responsible Genetics was having its convention at Harvard Business School and I was chairing a panel with King and other experts on biological warfare, on U.S. biological warfare programs. 
As I was walking into the Harvard Divinity School, Fox TV had a camera crew there and I said, ‘Obviously, this came out a U.S. biological weapons program and probably Fort Detrick.’ 
I conducted the session and made the same comment. Then I made a comment to a Washington, D.C., radio station to that effect [and to] the BBC, so everyone in the world heard me. 
At that point, someone gave an order that I was never to be interviewed again by any mainstream news about biological warfare programs. And that’s been the case since the first week of November 2001.”
As noted by Boyle, George Orwell’s book, “1984,” has become reality. Boyle has since lectured lawyers at DePaul Law School in Chicago about the totalitarian nature of the Patriot Act. 
“Snowden has correctly pointed out the federal government is spying on everything we say, all of our electronic communications, you name it,” Boyle says. 
“And again, the proof is I’ve been completely blackballed out of U.S. media. Indeed, if you go back and look at the Amerithrax attacks, they also hit mainstream U.S. media to make it clear to them that if they covered this issue they will be killed too.”
Bioweapons Are Developed To Be Used
As noted by Boyle, the U.S. government has a large stockpile of Amerithrax — a super weapons-grade nanotechnology anthrax with 1 trillion spores per gram — and that’s just the tip of the iceberg of the biological weapons developed. What’s more, Boyle has no doubt these weapons will eventually be put to use, as they have in the past. He says:
“There was a tabletop exercise at John Hopkins University last fall … on coronavirus.10Tabletop exercise, that’s a euphemism for a war game. Their estimate was that it killed 65 million people11 …
John Hopkins is up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare dirty work. They have a BSL-3 facility there … that they proudly announce on their website … They justify it by saying they’re developing vaccines. OK … How do they do that? 
They go out around the world, and this is a matter of public record, and scour for every type of hideous disease, fungus, virus and bacteria you can possibly imagine. They then bring it back to these BSL-4 labs and develop an offensive, biological agent using DNA genetic engineering and synthetic biology … set up by the Pentagon under DARPA …
Once they have this offensive agent, they then proceed to develop a vaccine, because the agent is no good unless you can have a vaccine to protect your own people. 
So, they’re developing vaccines to have biological weapons, because a biological weapon consists of two elements: the offensive biological warfare agent in the first place, and then, second, a vaccine to protect your own people, and that is what is being done at all these BSL-4 facilities, and many of the BSL-3s as well. 
John Hopkins has a BSL-3 and they admit they do dual use. That’s what dual use means. They first develop the offensive biological warfare agent and then they develop the supposed vaccine.”
Indeed, Johns Hopkins University is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It has also received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.12 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.13
How Can We Best Prevent or Treat COVID-19 Infection?
While it’s unclear exactly which treatment is the most effective, my guess is that Dr. Paul Marik’s intravenous vitamin C protocol for sepsis would be a good starting point, seeing how sepsis appears to be what kills those who succumb to a serious COVID-19 infection.
Marik’s retrospective before-after clinical study14,15 showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and vitamin B1 for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%. The precise protocol used was 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1,500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours.16 Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer. 
According to Marik, vitamin C and corticosteroids have a synergistic effect,17 which is part of why his combo protocol is so effective. Still, simply using high-dose IV vitamin C exclusively has been shown to improve survival in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory failure, reducing mortality from 46% to 30%.18
It also reduced the number of days they needed to remain hospitalized. On average, those who received vitamin C had by Day 28 spent three fewer days in the intensive care unit than the placebo group (seven days compared to 10). By Day 60, the treatment group had also spent seven fewer days in the hospital overall —15 days compared to 22.19
While there are no trials that look at integrating hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), my suspicion is that this would provide a powerful synergy that could get the fatality rate from sepsis even closer to zero. Sadly, HBOT is not available at many hospitals, and even if it were, it is not approved for sepsis.
You can learn more about Marik’s sepsis protocol in “Vitamin C — A Game Changer in Treatment of Deadly Sepsis,” along with commonsense recommendations for how to lower your risk of sepsis in the first place. 
You can also review Marik’s PowerPoint presentation, “Hydrocortisone, Ascorbic Acid and Thiamine for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,” presented at the 2020 Critical Care Reviews meeting in Australia.

"Truckers Warn Supply Chain Is in Jeopardy, but Not for Reasons You Might Think","As the number of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) deaths in Johnson County, Kansas increased to a total of nine on Monday, truckers are sounding the alarm that the the nation’s supply chain could be in jeopardy. The truckers who are speaking out are saying that they want the government to help protect them.
These truckers say that every day, they are hauling needed goods into COVID-19 hot spots with no protective equipment, testing capabilities, or ways to self-quarantine or seek treatment if they become sick.
The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association sent a letter Friday to President Donald Trump saying: “HELP — MAYDAY — 9-1-1.”
“Right now professional drivers are busting their butts to care for the nation,” said the letter, signed by Todd Spencer, president and CEO of the Grain Valley-based organization. “Their hard work and personal sacrifice should not include their health or even their lives if at all possible or preventable.”
If drivers start testing positive, there could be a tremendous reduction in drivers willing to risk everything, Spencer said.

Democrats Block Coronavirus Financial Relief Package,"The Senate just failed to clear a key procedural hurdle on a $1.6 trillion emergency rescue package, raising pressure on both parties to try again to reach a deal to address the economic devastation of the coronavirus outbreak.
On a 47-47 vote, the measure fell well short, after Democrats denied Republicans the 60 votes needed to move forward. Among the sticking points remaining are provisions for corporations getting federal assistance, including policy on stock buybacks and executive pay, as well as unemployment insurance and worker protections.
A livid Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) chastised Democrats for voting against moving forward and blamed Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for interfering.
“I want everybody to fully understand if we aren’t able to act tomorrow, it will be because of our colleagues on the other side continuing to dicker when the country expects us to come together and address the problem,” McConnell said on the floor. He added that over the last 48 hours there were bipartisan discussions among “regular members of the Senate, not in the Leadership office, not in the speaker’s office for goodness sakes.”
“She’s the Speaker of the House, not the Speaker of the Senate,” McConnell added. “We were doing just fine until that intervention.”
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) blamed McConnell for adopting a partisan stance by holding the cloture vote without an agreement, and said the package still has “many problems.”
“The majority leader was well aware of how the vote would go before it happened but he chose to go forward with it anyway even though negotiations are continuing,” Schumer said on the floor. “So who’s playing games? But our caucus is united to deliver a bill that addresses this health and economic crisis quickly and we’re committed to working in a bipartisan way to get it done.”
Drew Hammill, a senior Pelosi aide, chided Republicans: “Rule of thumb from the speaker of the House: don’t call the vote until you have the votes.”
Republicans and the White House insist that a deal has to be reached by Monday or financial markets will further deteriorate, exacerbating an already precarious position for the U.S. economy.

Amazon Worker Says Virus ‘Spreading like wildfire’ in Warehouses,"An Amazon warehouse employee has described his workplace as a “living hell” as staff work around the clock to deliver goods to homes trapped in lockdown.
The staff member, who wishes to remain anonymous, told Mirror Money he fears coronavirus could be spreading like wildfire in the Barlborough warehouse where he is employed.
“The country has been told Amazon will continue to stay open to provide their customers with essential items,” he explained.
But staff were working on more than just essentials, he added.
“We are selling the same usual stuff we would do normally with a large increase in things like garden equipment (lawnmowers, hedge trimmers and chainsaws).”
And that meant he felt his employer was putting him at risk of infection for non-essential items.
“There are measures that have been put in place to protect us,” he said.
“We have been told to stand one meter apart at all times while security metal detectors have been switched off.
“There are also things such as notices telling workers to clean their stations and equipment, before and after use, but there are no cleaning supplies commonly available.”
He said that while in theory, measures have been introduced, many are not practical.
“Whilst queueing for the clock in machine, we have to stand closer than one meter,” he said.
“Whilst working, it is impossible to be more than one meter away.
“You can be placed on either the role of a ‘Slammer’ or ‘Taper’ which results in you being at the end of a conveyor belt. Each belt has up to eight ‘packers’ sending boxes down. 
“By this point, these items have already come into contact with various workers, greatly increasing their risk of contamination.
“There has already been a large number of people sick and the virus is spreading like wildfire throughout the workplace, yet management refuses to close it down. 
“The company has become a living hell to work for.”
Under Amazon’s guidelines, the retailer continues to trade as normal as it provides an essential service to the public.

New Common Symptom of Coronavirus Observed by US Hospitals Revealed,"United States hospitals have observed some new symptoms that are not included in the list made available by the CDC. Scientists continue to learn more about the virus as it spreads. There are now over 100,000 reported cases in the U.S. with 1715 deaths.
According to Chinese data, cases of infection in the US surpassed China where the outbreak originated. China says it only has 81,394 infections as of today 3/28/20. Some have questioned whether or not the Chinese government is being honest about their coronavirus data. Indeed, the Communist Party of China has a history of lying about and covering-up issues they believe paint them in a negative light.
Although the sudden jump in active cases in the U.S. might alarm Americans. This sudden jump in positive cases has a lot to do with the rollout of coronavirus tests. Furthermore this gives scientists an opportunity to look at the virus in more subjects and learn a great deal about how to beat it.
Experts say that the proliferation of coronavirus cases in the United States has provided them with new insight regarding how the disease can affect certain populations.
From International Business Times:
A New Symptom
The throng of patients being admitted to U.S. hospitals has alerted medical personnel to a new symptom. People going to hospitals have complained of feeling stomach pain, a symptom that has not been included in the list of coronavirus symptoms.
Michael Hirsh, the director of public health in Worcester, Massachusetts, said that hospitals are now admitting patients who tested positive for coronavirus having only abdominal pain as their symptom. Dr. Hirsh said that what they are seeing are patients coming in no so much having respiratory complaints but with abdominal pains.
Stomach Pain And Pneumonia
According to Dr. Hirsch, the pain they feel in their tummy is caused by the development of pneumonia located in the lower lobes of the patients’ lungs. If these lobes are frequently inflamed, the irritation in their diaphragm can cause pain in their abdominal area.
Dr. Hirsch, who is also a general surgeon, said that the more they see the disease, the better they learn about it. He said that as time goes by, scientists are going to see some manifestations of the disease that did not fit that classic symptom of fever and dry hacking cough.
No Respiratory Symptoms
The general surgeon revealed that many of the COVID-19 patients suffering from abdominal pain did not have any respiratory symptoms. Although at the moment, there is inadequate data they can use to map out trustworthy patterns, it appears that it is the younger patients who report stomach pain. On the other hand, it is the older patients who show respiratory symptoms.
According to health experts, common symptoms of COVID-19 are having a high temperature, shortness of breathing, and a new, continuous cough. Some patients reported having diarrhea and suffering from conjunctivitis (pink eye), which health experts later on attributed to coronavirus infection.

Genius Doctor Turns One Ventilator Into Nine Using DIY Tips From YouTube,"As hospitals around the world continue to grapple with a general shortage of supplies to help them with the devastating coronavirus pandemic, one doctor in Canada has managed to use a bit of creativity, ingenuity, and an idea inspired by YouTube to help future patients.
Dr. Alain Gaithier, an anesthetist at the Perth and Smiths Falls District Hospital in Ontario, was worried about the possibility that his rural hospital’s one ventilator would hardly be able to carry the load that the CoViD-19 outbreak could entail.
So Gauthier, who has a Ph. D. in respiratory mechanics, borrowed an idea conceived by American doctors Greg Neyman and Charlene Babcock in 2006 to double the capacity of a single ventilator. According to CBC the idea was tested successfully following the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. Babcock eventually created a how-to video explaining how the DIY “upgrade” works.
In just ten minutes, Gauthier used extra tubing to double the number of patients that could be ventilated at the hospital.
The way the system works is that the two patients simultaneously connected to the ventilator must be roughly the same size and with the same lung capacity. Multiple hoses are then attached to the one ventilator, which is then run at several times its normal power.
While imperfect, Gauthier said that “if it comes to last resort, I’m prepared to use it.”
Gauthier’s colleague, Alan Drummond, excitedly shared images of the rigged ventilator on Twitter, jokingly calling Gauthier “an evil genius.” He wrote:
“So in ten minutes the evil genius who is one of our GP anesthetists (with a PhD in diaphragmatic mechanics) increased our rural hospitals ventilator capacity from one to nine!!!”

Drummond, an emergency physician at the hospital, also said that he broke social distancing protocol to give his colleague a big hug.
Even billionaire tycoon Elon Musk expressed his admiration at Gauthier’s efforts, commenting in a the tweet that it was an “interesting thread.”
Continuing, Musk noted that perhaps it could one day lead to a more effective system to ensure that patients breathe. He added:
“A single computer, pump & pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care & avoid cross-flow risk.”
A single computer, pump & pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care & avoid cross-flow risk
However, for Gauthier his newfound fame is the last thing that concerns him in a rural region where many of the 60,000 people served by the hospital are older or have such conditions as diabetes and chronic pulmonary disease.
He also doesn’t want credit for his invention.
“A lot of work is being done by pretty much everyone,” he stressed.
Like many health care systems struggling with the outbreak, Gauthier and his coworkers worry that they soon may be forced to choose which critical patients receive a ventilator and which are simply allowed to die—a dilemma that he hopes to avoid with his Gerry-rigged system.
“We are concerned, we’re trying to get ready as much as possible,” Gauthier said.

City Bans Easter Egg Hunts,"The City of Fort Worth has banned easter egg hunts for now. People who disregard the ban are warned they will be fined. City officials claim easter egg hunts encourage gatherings.
In order to discourage gatherings in parks, especially during one of the busiest days of the year in the park system (April 12) vehicle access to many popular parks is closed.
The city is urging the community to stay home or limit park visits to short walks or bike rides to keep the parks from becoming overcrowded.
Fort Worth’s ‘Stay Home ­– Work Safe Order’ allows for healthy outdoor activities such as walking, biking, hiking, golfing or running, provided individuals maintain the six foot social distancing requirement from people outside their household.
However, the city says parties and group activities (which includes Easter Egg hunts) are not permitted.
Police department and code enforcement officers say they may issue citations in parks to those who are gathering and not adhering to social distancing standards.

Family Kicked Off Flight Over Coughing Daughter,"A family of five say they were kicked off of a plane just before takeoff over fears their coughing toddler could be infected with coronavirus.
Canadian Emmanuel Faug, his wife Clémentine Ferraton and their three kids boarded a flight from Quebec City to Paris on February 23.
However, it’s been reported fellow passengers then asked Air Transat cabin crew to question the family over 21-month-old Lila’s coughing.
According to Ouest-France, others on board began complaining the little girl could be infected with the killer virus.
A member of the crew then approached the family and asked the mother if she could provide a medical document proving their daughter was not contagious.
She assured the crew the child was safe to travel and told them they had been given the all clear by a doctor earlier that day who said the girl had a cold but nothing more.
However, the couple was not able to provide a written document about their daughter’s health.
One flight attendant then reportedly asked a doctor on board to examine the girl who also confirmed she was fine to fly.
However, it’s claimed the captain was not happy with the doctor’s diagnosis and contacted Medlink, a company specialising in aviation medical issues.
He was then reportedly advised to eject the girl from the plane because she did not have a medical certificate to state she was not infected with the deadly virus.
An Air Transat spokesman said: “After analysing the situation, MedLink determined that the passenger’s medical condition posed a significant potential risk to passengers and crew during the flight.
“They [MedLink] follow the recommendations of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) regarding contagious diseases.”
However, the girl’s mom said: “We were thrown off a plane against the advice of two doctors, one in person. I don’t find this normal at all.”

From an Italian to the Rest of the World: You Have No Idea About What’s Coming,"Verified Account -Italian Citizen
(First thing first I’m sorry for any eventual grammar errors but English isn’t my first lenguage Second, this is a repost because in another sub people asked me to post it on r/Coronavirus but it doesn’t accept it, so I came here as the rules advised).
As I think everybody knows, Italy is on quarantine because of the coronavirus outbreak. That means that everybody has to stay home unless you’ve got valid reasons to go out. This situation is bad, but what’s worse is seeing the rest of the world behaving as if it isn’t going to happen to them. We know what you’re thinking because we were in your place too.
Let’s see how thing developed (keep in mind it all happened in around 2 weeks):
STAGE 1. You know that coronavirus exists, and the first cases begin to appear in your country. Well, nothing to worry about, it’s just a bad flu! I mean I’m not 75+yo so what could possibly happen to me? I’m safe, everybody is overreacting, what’s the need to go out with masks and stock toilet paper? I’m going to live my life as usual, there’s no need to freak out.
STAGE 2. The number of cases begins to be significant. They declare “red zone” and quarantine one or two small cities where they found the first cases and a lot of people were infected (~22/02). Well that’s sad and somewhat worrisome but they’re taking care of it so nothing to panic about. There are some deaths but they’re all old people with other pathologies so the media is just trying to create panic for views, how shameful. People lead their life as usual, I mean I’m not going to stop going out and meeting my friends and so on am I? There’s no need to. It’s not going to get me. Everybody’s fine here.
STAGE 3. The number of cases is rapidly going up. They almost doubled in one day. There’s more deaths. They declare red zones and quarantine the 4 regions where the majority of cases are registered (7/03). In Italy at this point 1/4 of the county is under quarantine, schools and universities are closed in these areas but bars, work places, restaurants and so on are still open. The decree gets released by some newspaper before it should so around 10k people from the red zone escape from the area that same night to return to their homes in the rest of Italy (this will be important later). Most of the population of the remaing 3/4 of Italy still does what it always does, a portion of the quarantined too. They still don’t realize the seriousness of the situation. I mean yes, everywhere you turn they talk about the coronavirus, they advise to wash your hands and limit your going out, assemblies of large numbers of people are forbidden and so on, every 5 minutes on TV they remind you of these rules. But it still hasn’t settled in people’s minds.
STAGE 4. The number of cases is heavily increasing. Schools and universities are closed everywhere for at least a month. It’s a national health emergency. Hospitals are at capacity, entire units are cleared to make space for coronavirus patients. There aren’t enough doctors and nurses, they’re calling retired ones and those who are in the last 2 years of university, there’s no shifts any more, just work as much as you can. Of course doctors and nurses are getting infected, spreading it to their families and so on. There’s too many cases of pneumonia, too many people who need ICU and not enough places for everyone. The same goes for respiraty aids (I don’t know if that’s the correct name). At this point is like being at war: doctors have to choose who to treat based on their survival chance, that means that the elderly and trauma/stroke patients can’t get treated because corona cases have the priority. There’s not enough resources for everybody so they have to be distributed for the best outcome. I wish I was joking but it’s literally what has been happening. People have died because there wasn’t any more space, I have a doctor friend who called me devasteted because he had to let 3 people die that day, nurses crying because they see people dying in front of them and can’t do anything aside from offering some oxygen. A friend’s relative died yesterday of corona because they couldn’t treat him. Chemios have been delayed until further notice. It’s chaos, the system is collapsing. Coronavirus and the crisis it’s provoking is all you hear about everywhere.
STAGE 5. Rember the 10k idiot who ran from the red zone to the rest of Italy? Well, the entire country has to be declared under quarantine (9/03). The goal is to delay the spreading of the virus as much as possible. People can go to work, do the grocery shopping, go to the farmacy, and all businesses are still open because otherwise the economy would collapse (it already is), but you can’t move from your comune (which is like a municipality I guess) unless you have a valid reason. Now there’s fear, you see a lot of people with masks and gloves around but there are still are people who think that they’re invincible, who go to restaurants in large groups, hang out with friends to drink and so on. Next step.
STAGE 6. 2 days later, it’s announced that all (most) businesses are closed: bars, restaurants, shopping centers, all kinds of shops etc. Everything except supermarkets and pharmacies. You can move around only if you have an autocertification with you, which is an official document in which you declare your name, where you’re coming from, where you’re going and what for. There are a lot of police check points, if you’re found outside without a valid reason you risk a fine up to €206, and if you’re a known positive patient you risk from 1 to 12 years of jail for homicide.
So that’s what the situation is like now today as of the 12/03. Keep in mind that it all happened in around 2 weeks, 5 DAYS FROM STAGE 3 TO NOW.
The rest of the world apart from Italy, China and Korea is just now beginning to reach the other stages, so let me tell you this: you have no idea what’s coming to get you. I know because 2 weeks ago I was the one who had no idea and though that it wasn’t that bad. But it is. And not because the virus alone is particularly dangerous or deadly, but for all the consequences it brings. It’s hard to see all these countries act like it’s not coming and not taking the precautions that are necessary for the well-being of its citizens while they still can, so please if you’re reading this try to act in your best interest. This problem isn’t going to solve itself by ignoring it. Just wondering how many undiscovered cases there might be in America alone is scary, and they’re in for a big, big trouble because of how their country is run.
Our government for once did a good job I must say. The actions taken were drastic but necessary, and this may be the only way to limit the spreading. It’s working in China so we hope it will work here too (it’s already working in some of the first red zones which were quarantined before everybody else). Also they’re taking measures to protect us citizens such as suspending mortgage payments for next months, help for shop owners who were obligated to close and so on.
I realize that these takes are really difficult, if not impossible, to take in some countries, and it’s really worrying to think about what it could mean in global scale. I see a very dark time ahead of us all over the world and it makes me so angry to see all these countries not taking action while they can. I wonder if this pandemic will be a turning point in our society, what do you think?
So guys, if there are cases where you live, then the virus is spreading, and you’re maybe 1 or 2 weeks behind us, but you’ll get to our point eventually. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE take any precaution you can take, don’t act like it’s not going to get you, and, if you can, STAY HOME.
(Avete capito italiani? STATE. A. CASA.)
Edit 2: this post was written yesterday morning, A LOT happened in A LOT of countries in the meanwhile, and that’s a good thing! And from what I can see more stages were suppressed because many governments are going full metal right now, as they should. So this post may not apply anymore as it did 2 days ago but I’m not editing it, also leaving it as a report of what happened here.
Edit:
YES, there’s food for everybody, plenty of food, grocery shopping is not a problem at all. We can go grocery shopping, it’s comprehended in the necessities.
YES, we can take our dog for a walk, it’s comprehended in the necessities. You have to follow the rules (1 mete rule, avoid crowds etc) and have the autocertification. Can I go for a walk alone? I mean, the could possibly fine me but I don’t think it has happened; have your walk if you need, always respecting the rules, but it’s a health emergency so it’s better to avoid it if you can.
For anybody who thinks I’m a fear mongerer or exaggerating – I’m only reporting what happened, trying to inform and warn people.
Wash your hands, stay safe and if you can STAY HOME!

China Quarantines City of 11 Million After Deadly Virus Spreads to U.S.,"Until further notice, 11 million residents of Wuhan will be trapped in the city unless they receive “special permission” to leave.
A Chinese news bulletin that was first picked up in the U.S. by Financial Times reporter Gabriel Wildau has indicated that the city of Wuhan is now under a quarantine in response to the rapid spread of a deadly SARS-like virus called 2019-nCoV.
Wuhan authorities just quarantined the entire city. No one permitted to leave without a ""special reason"". #coronavirus https://t.co/iShqGmqUbQ
The infectious respiratory illness is a new strain of coronavirus that is causing a type of pneumonia. Some experts have compared it to SARS because it is also a coronavirus. Scientists have examined the genetic code of the new virus and have found that it is more closely related to SARS than any other human coronavirus.
The illness is said to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan and quickly spread to other areas of China, then Japan, Thailand, South Korea, and the United States.
Soon after the first case was reported in the U.S., the Chinese government made the call to quarantine the city of Wuhan.
Wuhan’s 11 million residents will be trapped in the city until further notice unless they receive special permission to leave after an intense screening process.
While hundreds of cases have been officially reported, experts fear that there may actually be thousands who are infected by now. At least 17 people have died from the illness. Prior to the quarantine of Wuhan the government was actively censoring news about the outbreak. They also deleted social media posts that contradicted official statements on the matter.
In light of their mismanagement of the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003, China is under intense international scrutiny about the outbreak. The Chinese government was accused of attempting to cover up the severity of the SARS outbreak when it initially occurred.
Residents of the affected areas are being advised to avoid “unprotected” contact with live animals. They are also being advised to thoroughly cook meat and eggs as well as avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms
WHO has issued advice for individuals on how to protect themselves and others from the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) https://t.co/f7LSwJe43V

20% of U.S. Citizens Now on Lockdown,"Illinois has now joined California and New York in lockdowns to curb the spread of coronavirus.
Governors implemented “shelter in place” orders limiting all residents to stay in their homes. They shall do so unless absolutely necessary or otherwise essential. This goes into effect at 5pm on Saturday and will last until at least April 7, Governor J.B. Pritzker said.
As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) cases continue to increase, Illinois is the latest U.S. state to take strict measures in an effort to reduce the viral spread which has increased exponentially in countries such as Italy.
New York, California, and Illinois are collectively home to more than 70 million people who are now being ordered to stay in their apartments and houses.
In other words over 20 percent of the U.S. population is on lockdown.
“We have to mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Pritzker said in a tweet hours before the official announcement.
“We have to slow the number of new cases and ensure our hospitals and health care workers have the capacity and the resources to treat those who are sick…We have to flatten the curve,” he said.
With 4,032 reported deaths in Italy at the time of this publishing, over 19,624 cases have been reported in the United States, which is still in its early stages of the disease. Both of these numbers continue to grow.
Italy’s cases and deaths grew exponentially. Italy’s death toll, for instance, increased by approximately 1,000 in the last 48 hours alone. Bringing Italy’s total to more than that of the original epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan, China.
Italy has been dubbed the new epicenter of the European coronavirus outbreak.
Different state governments in the U.S. have taken varying levels of action ordering people to stay at home or to limit gatherings.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday ordered all “non-essential” workers to remain home.
“We need everyone to be safe – otherwise, no one can be safe,” Cuomo said at a press conference Friday.
The “essential” places allowed to remain open include grocery stores, hospitals, and pharmacies.
New York’s provisions go into effect on Sunday and could be in place for more than a couple weeks, Cuomo said.
“This could be going on for months,” the Governor acknowledged.",,https://realfarmacy.com/20-percent-lockdown/
Coronavirus Task Force Full List: “15 Days to Slow the Spread”,"On Monday, the President’s Coronavirus Task Force provided updated coronavirus (COVID-19) guidance outlined as “15 Days to Slow the Spread”. 
Some key points from the latest guidance are that over the next 15 days, Americans should not gather in groups of more than 10 people, schooling should be at home and discretionary travel and social visits should be avoided. Further, if anyone in a household tests positive for the virus, everyone who lives there should stay home.
The full list of the “15 Days to Slow the Spread” guidance is as follows:
1. Listen and follow the directions of your state and local authorities.2. If you feel sick, stay home. Do not go to work. Contact your medical provider.3. If your children are sick, keep them at home. Do not send them to school. Contact your medical provider.4. If someone in your household has tested positive for the coronavirus, keep the entire household at home. Do not go to work. Do not go to school. Contact your medical provider.5. If you are an older person, stay home and away from other people.6. If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition that can put you at increased risk (for example, a condition that impairs your lung or heart function or weakens your immune system), stay home and away from other people.7. Even if you are young, or otherwise healthy, you are at risk and your activities can increase the risk for others. It is critical that you do your part to stop the spread of the coronavirus.8. Work or engage in schooling from home whenever possible.9. If you work in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the Department of Homeland Security, such as healthcare services and pharmaceutical and food supply, you have a special responsibility to maintain your normal work schedule. You and your employers should follow CDC guidance to protect your health at work.10. Avoid social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people.11. Avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, and food courts – use drive-thru, pickup, or delivery options.12. Avoid discretionary travel, shopping trips, and social visits.13. Do not visit nursing homes or retirement or long-term care facilities unless to provide critical assistance.14. Practice good hygiene:15. Wash your hands, especially after touching any frequently used item or surface.16. Avoid touching your face.17. Sneeze or cough into a tissue, or the inside of your elbow.18. Disinfect frequently used items and surfaces as much as possible.
These recommendations are made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus.
The Health Department advises that if you do feel sick:
• Stay home and avoid contact with others.• If you are experiencing the symptoms of COVID-19 which are fever, cough, and shortness of breath, contact your healthcare provider and seek care.• Be sure to call your healthcare provider ahead of your visit and let them know about the symptoms you’re experiencing. This will help the healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people from getting infected or exposed.• Your healthcare provider will make a determination and provide guidance for COVID-19 testing.• Older adults and people who have severe underlying chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.• People at higher risk for serious illness from COVID-19 should contact their healthcare provider early, even if their illness is mild.• Most people with illnesses due to coronavirus recover at home on their own without any difficulty. There are no specific treatments for COVID-19, but treatments to bring down fever or alleviate other symptoms may help.• If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately. In adults, typical emergency warning signs are:• Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath• Persistent pain or pressure in the chest• New confusion or inability to arouse• Bluish lips or face
The best way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Social distancing or maintaining a minimum distance of 6 feet away from others is recommended at this point on a community level to minimize or avoid any potential exposure. 
However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:
• Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.• Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.• Avoid close contact with people who are sick.• Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.• Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

How to Treat Coronavirus Without Drugs,"By Andrew W. Saul, Editor of Orthomolecular.org
(OMNS January 30, 2020) Abundant clinical evidence confirms vitamin C’s powerful antiviral effect when used in sufficient quantity. Treating influenza with very large amounts of vitamin C is not a new idea at all. Frederick R. Klenner, MD, and Robert F. Cathcart, MD, successfully used this approach for decades. Frequent oral dosing with vitamin C sufficient to reach a daily bowel tolerance limit will work for most persons. Intravenous vitamin C is indicated for the most serious cases.
Bowel tolerance levels of vitamin C, taken as divided doses all throughout the day, are a clinically proven antiviral without equal. Vitamin C can be used alone or right along with medicines if one so chooses.
“Some physicians would stand by and see their patients die rather than use ascorbic acid. Vitamin C should be given to the patient while the doctors ponder the diagnosis.” (Frederick R. Klenner, MD, chest specialist)
Dr. Robert Cathcart advocated treating influenza with up to 150,000 milligrams of vitamin C daily, often intravenously. You and I can, to some extent, simulate a 24 hour IV of vitamin C by taking it by mouth very, very often. When I had pneumonia, it took 2,000 mg of vitamin C every six minutes, by the clock, to get me to saturation. My oral daily dose was over 100,000 mg. Fever, cough and other symptoms were reduced in hours; complete recovery took just a few days. That is performance at least as good as any pharmaceutical will give, and the vitamin is both safer and cheaper. Many physicians consider high doses of vitamin C to be so powerful an antiviral that it may be ranked as a functional immunization for a variety influenza strains. [1]
Dr. Cathcart writes: 
“The sicker a person was, the more ascorbic acid they would tolerate orally without it causing diarrhea. In a person with an otherwise normal GI tract when they were well, would tolerate 5 to 15 grams of ascorbic acid orally in divided doses without diarrhea. With a mild cold 30 to 60 grams; with a bad cold, 100 grams; with a flu, 150 grams; and with mononucleosis, viral pneumonia, etc. 200 grams or more of ascorbic acid would be tolerated orally without diarrhea. The process of finding what dose will cause diarrhea and will eliminate the acute symptoms, I call titrating to bowel tolerance.
“The ascorbate effect is a threshold effect. Symptoms are usually neutralized when a dose of about 90% or more of bowel tolerance is reached with oral ascorbic acid. Intravenous sodium ascorbate is about 2½ times more powerful than ascorbic acid by mouth and since for all practical purposes huge doses of sodium ascorbate are non-toxic, whatever dose necessary to eliminate free radical driven symptoms should be given.”
The coronavirus, in acute infections, may be expected to be just as susceptible to vitamin C as all of the other viruses against which it has been proven to be extremely effective. There has never been a documented situation in which sufficiently high dosing with vitamin C has been unable to neutralize or kill any virus against which it has been tested. 
Even the common cold is a coronavirus. A “new” opportunistic virus is a not a big surprise. History is full of them.
Flu Pandemic of 1919-1920
About 10 million soldiers were killed in World War I (1914-1918), charging machine guns and getting mowed down month after month. There were nearly a million casualties at the Somme and another million at Verdun. A terrible slaughter went on for four years. Yet, in just the two years following the war, over 20 million people died from influenza. That is more than twice as many deaths from the flu in one-half the time it took the machine guns. 
With a century’s worth of accumulated scientific hindsight, we must today ask this: Was a lack of vaccinations really the cause of those flu deaths, or was it really wartime stress, and especially war-induced malnutrition, that set the stage in 1918? And now, once again, we have an alarming and rather similar scenario: between nutrient-poor processed convenience foods, McNothing meals and TV news scare stories, we have the basic ingredients for an epidemic.
Influenza is a serious disease, and historically, has been the Reaper’s scythe. There is no way to make light of that. It warrants a closer look at how the medical profession and government have approached different types of influenza. 
Swine Flu
In the mid-1970s, there was the colossal Swine Flu panic. Here is what the government of the United States said about the infamous Swine Flu vaccine, in a 1976 mass-distributed FDA Consumer Memo on the subject: 
“Some minor side effects – tenderness in the arm, low fever, tiredness – will occur in less than 4% of (vaccinated) adults. Serious reactions from flu vaccines are very rare.”
Many will remember the very numerous and very serious side effects of Swine Flu vaccine that forced the federal immunization program to a halt. So much for blanket claims of safety.
As far as being essential, in the same memo the FDA said this of the same vaccine: 
“Question: What can be done to prevent an epidemic? Answer: The only preventive action we can take is to develop a vaccine to immunize the public against the virus. This will prevent the virus from spreading.”
This was seen to be totally false. The public immunization program for Swine Flu was abruptly halted and still there was no epidemic. If vaccination were the only defense, one might expect that tens of millions of Americans would have been struck down with the Swine Flu, for a large percentage of the population of the U.S. was not vaccinated.
“Vaccines are being used as an ideological weapon. What you see every year as the flu is caused by 200 or 300 different agents with a vaccine against two of them. That is simply nonsense.” (Tom Jefferson, MD, epidemiologist) [2]
Bird Flu
Robert F. Cathcart, MD, writes: “Treatment of the Bird Flu with massive doses of ascorbate would be the same as any other flu except that the severity of the disease indicates that it may take unusually massive doses of ascorbic acid orally or even intravenous sodium ascorbate. (Why the dose needed is somewhat proportional to the severity of the disease being treated is discussed in my paper published in 1981, Titrating to Bowel Tolerance, Anascorbemia, and Acute Induced Scurvy.) I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C but it is possible that the bird flu may require even higher doses such as 150 to 300 grams a day. Additionally, this flu could be primarily respiratory. This means that hospitalization might be necessary. If massive doses of ascorbate are not used, they may not be adequate. Most hospitals will not allow adequate doses of ascorbate to be given.
“Initial oral doses of ascorbic acid should also be massive. I would suggest like 12 grams every 15 minutes until diarrhea is produced. Then, however, doses should be reduced but not much. Listen to your body. If there are many symptoms, keep taking doses that cause a little diarrhea. You do not want constant runs because it is the amount you absorb that is important, not the amount you put in your mouth.” [1,3]
BBC – 9 April 2006: “The chances of bird flu virus mutating into a form that spreads between humans are ‘very low,’ the government’s chief scientific adviser has said. Sir David King said any suggestion a global flu pandemic in humans was inevitable was ‘totally misleading.'” [4]
SARS
The coronavirus outbreak in China seems to be due to a virus similar to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which was also a coronavirus. You may remember SARS from 2002. I most certainly do, as I was in Toronto, Canada at the time, smack in the middle of it. I took a lot of vitamin C preventively and had zero symptoms. [5]
“The common cold is a coronavirus, and SARS is a coronavirus, so they are the same viral type.” (David Jenkins, MD, Professor of Medicine and Nutritional Science, University of Toronto) 
Waiting for a vaccine?
“We have set up a situation where a fear is created, and then we try to create the treatment for this fear. The public gets the idea that the flu is going to kill them and the vaccine will save them. Neither is true.” (Marc Siegel, MD, author of False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear)  [2]
Robert F. Cathcart: “All this talk about a vaccine is too late; a waste of time now, especially when we know how to cure the disease already. Every flu I have seen so far (since 1970) has been cured or ameliorated by massive doses of ascorbate. All of these diseases kill by way of free radicals. These free radicals are easily eliminated by massive doses of ascorbate. This is a matter of chemistry, not medicine. The time has come to stop hiding our ability to treat these acute infectious diseases with massive doses of ascorbate.
“Ideally, however, in serious cases this disease should be treated first with at least 180 grams or more of sodium ascorbate intravenously every 24 hours running constantly until the fever is broken and most of the symptoms are ameliorated. If after a few hours that rate of administration does not have an obvious ameliorating effect, the rate should be increased.” [6]
What dosage?
Vitamin C fights all types of viruses. Although the dose should truly be high, even a low supplemental amount of vitamin C saves lives. This is very important for those with low incomes and few treatment options. For example, in one well-controlled, randomized study, just 200 mg/day vitamin C given to the elderly resulted in improvement in respiratory symptoms in the most severely ill, hospitalized patients. And there were 80% fewer deaths in the vitamin C group.[7]
But to best build up our immune systems, we need to employ large, orthomolecular doses of several vital nutrients. The physicians on the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service review board specifically recommend at least 3,000 milligrams (or more) of vitamin C daily, in divided doses. Vitamin C empowers the immune system and can directly denature many viruses. It can be taken as ascorbic acid (which is sour like vinegar), either in capsules or as crystals dissolved in water or juice. It can also be taken as sodium ascorbate, which is non-acidic. To be most effective, it should be taken to bowel tolerance. This means taking high doses several (or many) times each day. See the references below for more information.
Nebulized hydrogen peroxide
Thomas E. Levy, MD: “Viral syndromes start or are strongly supported by ongoing viral replication in the naso- and oropharynx. When appropriate agents are nebulized (into a fine spray) and this viral presence is quickly eliminated, the rest of the body “mops up” quite nicely the rest of the viral presence. The worst viral infections are continually fed and sustained by the viral growth in the pharynx. Probably the best and most accessible agent to nebulize would be 3% hydrogen peroxide for 15 to 30 minutes several times daily.” [10]
An example of successful treatment by ascorbate: 
“Chikungunya is a viral illness characterized by severe joint pains, which may persist for months to years. There is no effective treatment for this disease. We treated 56 patients with moderate to severe persistent pains with a single infusion of ascorbic acid ranging from 25-50 grams and hydrogen peroxide (3 cc of a 3% solution) from July to October 2014. Patients were asked about their pain using the Verbal Numerical Rating Scale-11 immediately before and after treatment. The mean Pain Score before and after treatment was 8 and 2 respectively (60%) (p < 0.001); and 5 patients (9%) had a Pain Score of 0. The use of intravenous ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide resulted in a statistically significant reduction of pain in patients with moderate to severe pain from the Chikungunya virus immediately after treatment.” [11]
Available evidence indicates that supplementation with multiple micronutrients with immune-supporting roles may modulate immune function and reduce the risk of infection. Micronutrients with the strongest evidence for immune support are vitamins C and D and zinc. [8,9]
Additional recommended nutrients
Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form). Many people are deficient in magnesium, because modern agriculture often does not supply adequate magnesium in the soil, and food processing removes magnesium. It is an extremely important nutrient that is essential for hundreds of biochemical pathways. A blood test for magnesium cannot correctly diagnose a deficiency. A long-term deficiency of magnesium can build up in the body that may take 6 months to a year of higher than normal doses to replete.
A very cheap and highly beneficial adjunct for any acute infection, especially viral, is oral magnesium chloride. Amazingly, just as intravenous vitamin C has been shown to cure polio, an oral magnesium chloride regimen has been shown to do the same thing, as or even more effectively than the vitamin C. [12-14]
Mix 25 grams MgCl2 in a quart of water. Depending on body size (tiny infant to an adult), give 15 to 125 ml of this solution four times daily. If the taste is too salty/bitter, a favorite juice can be added.
Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. (Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000). Vitamin D is stored in the body for long periods but takes a long time to reach an effective level. If you are deficient (e.g. if you haven’t taken vitamin D and it’s near the end of winter when the sun is low in the sky) you can start by taking larger than normal doses for 2 weeks to build up the level quickly. The maintenance dose varies with body weight, 400-1000 IU/day for children and 2000-5000 IU/day for adults.
William Grant, PhD, says: “Coronaviruses cause pneumonia as does influenza. A study of the case-fatality rate from the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic in the United States showed that most deaths were due to pneumonia. The SARS-coronavirus and the current China coronavirus were both most common in winter, when vitamin D status is lowest.” [15-19]
“I have found the value of bolstering immune function with Vitamin D to be incredibly powerful.” (Dr. Jeffrey Allyn Ruterbusch) 
Zinc
Zinc is a powerful antioxidant and is essential for many biochemical pathways. It has been shown to be effective in helping the body fight infections. [20,21] A recommended dose is 20-40 mg/day for adults. 
Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily. Selenium is an essential nutrient and an important antioxidant that can help to fight infections. Dr. Damien Downing says: “Swine flu, bird flu and SARS (another coronavirus) all developed in selenium-deficient areas of China; Ebola and HIV in Selenium-deficient areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. This is because the same oxidative stress that causes us inflammation forces viruses to mutate rapidly in order to survive. ‘When Se-deficient virus-infected hosts were supplemented with dietary Se, viral mutation rates diminished and immunocompetence improved.'” [22]
B-complex vitamins and vitamin A: A multivitamin tablet with each meal will supply these conveniently and economically. 
Nutritional supplements are not just a good idea. For fighting viruses, they are absolutely essential.

U.S. Closes Border With Canada,"President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have announced The United States border with Canada will temporarily close to “non-essential traffic” due to the coronavirus pandemic.
“We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic,” President Trump posted on Twitter.
We will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected. Details to follow!
The border between the U.S. and Canada happens to be the longest border between two countries in the world.
The European Union agreed to close its external borders to non-citizens on Tuesday.
“Travelers will no longer be permitted to cross the border for recreation and tourism. In both our countries, we’re encouraging people to stay home,” Prime Minister Trudeau said.
This follows Monday’s order by Trudeau to close Canada’s border to non-citizens, with the exception of U.S. citizens.
“Our governments recognize that we preserve supply chains between both countries,” Trudeau stated.
“These supply chains ensure that food, fuel and life-saving medicines reach people on both sides of the border. Supply chains including trucking will not be affected by this new measure.”

Chinese Tourists Overrun Mountain as Beijing Claims Covid-19 Under Control,"Tens of thousands of tourists in China flooded a popular mountain range this weekend after it reopened. It has been closed for weeks due to fears of spreading coronavirus.
As a result, Huangshan also known as the Yellow Mountains, was forced to shutdown after its trails were filled with more than 20,000 visitors. 
Footage posted on social media reveals residents being stuck in crowds of people attempting to hike trails during the three-day Qing Ming holiday.
The rush to the mountain came after local government of Anhui Province in east China offered free entry to 29 scenic spots to attract tourists. Huangshan was one of the destinations offered for free.
Officials in Huangshan announced that all Anhui residents can visit appointed scenic spots for free between April 1 and April 14.
Park authorities said yesterday in a statement that the park exceeded its daily limit of 20,000. They urged tourists to visit other sites or come back at another time.
The Great Wall of China has also recently reopened after being deserted for weeks amid fears of the coronavirus.
Other popular tourist attractions, including the West Lake, Terra Cotta Army and Potala Palace, have also opened their doors. The Shanghai Disneyland and Forbidden City, however, remain shut. 
Visitors are asked to show their health status on their phones via a mandatory app which ranks citizens based on their history of activities. This app tells citizens whether or not they must submit to a mandatory quarantine or are approved to leave the house. 
Visitors at the attractions are also forced to wear face masks and submit to having their temperatures taken upon arrival.",,https://realfarmacy.com/chinese-corona-crowd/
Leaked Internal Emails Show How CDC Slowed Early Response to Coronavirus,"On Feb. 13, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent out an email with what the author described as an “URGENT” call for help.
The agency was struggling with one of its most important duties: keeping track of Americans suspected of having the novel coronavirus. It had “an ongoing issue” with organizing — and sometimes flat-out losing — forms sent by local agencies about people thought to be infected. The email listed job postings for people who could track or retrieve this paperwork.
“Help needed urgently,” the CDC wrote.
This email is among hundreds of pages of correspondence between federal and state public health officials obtained by ProPublica through a records request in Nevada.
During the period in which the correspondence was written, from January to early March, health officials were trying to stay ahead of the coronavirus outbreak underway in China. By mid-February, when the CDC job postings email went out, the virus had a toehold in the United States, where there were already 15 confirmed cases. In another two weeks, the first case of community transmission would be reported in California, followed shortly by cases in Washington.
The documents — mostly emails — provide a behind-the-scenes peek into the messy early stages of the U.S. response to the coronavirus, revealing an antiquated public health system trying to adapt on the fly. What comes through clearly is confusion, as the CDC underestimated the threat from the virus and stumbled in communicating to local public health officials what should be done.
The same week the CDC sent out the email about the job openings, the agency sent Nevada officials alerts about 80 potential coronavirus patients to monitor, documents show. Four were not Nevada residents.
A state epidemiologist, in each instance, corrected the agency, informing the CDC that the person was from New York, not Nevada. (The CDC then redirected each report to New York, the documents show.)
The confusion sometimes went both ways. On March 4, a program manager in the Nevada Health Department reached out to the CDC to ask about congressional funding for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
“There seems to be a communications blackout on this end,” the program manager wrote, wondering if funds would be distributed based on the number of cases in each state or by population.
“Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to your questions,” responded a CDC staffer, apologizing for the lack of information. “We are hearing all of the rumor mills as well.”
“Thank you,” the Nevada program manager replied. “It’s good to be confused together.”
***
On Jan. 28, when the CDC had confirmed five cases of the coronavirus, all in travelers who arrived from outside the country, he emailed colleagues to acknowledge it posed “a very serious public health threat,” but he assured them “the virus is not spreading in the U.S. at this time.”

"World Health Organization Declares Pandemic as Number of Confirmed Coronavirus Cases Exceeds 120,000 and Death Toll in U.S. Hits 31","WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic as the global death toll rose above 4,300 and the number of confirmed cases exceeded 121,000.
“We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear, Tefros said at a news conference, adding that “all countries can still change the course of this pandemic.”
The U.S. death toll climbed to 31 and the number of U.S. cases rolled past 1,000, federal health officials said. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield told a congressional committee the virus has spread to at least 38 states. 
“Right now the epicenter – the new China – is Europe,” Redfield said. “And there’s a lot of people coming back and forth from Europe that are now starting to seed these communities.”
