 Illinois Mayor Grants Herself Power to Ban Guns During Coronavirus Pandemic,"Champaign, Illinois mayor Deborah Frank Feinen signed an executive order giving herself the power to order the seizure of firearms, ammunition, alcohol and gasoline during the coronavirus pandemic.
The executive order also enables the government to “take possession of private property” and cut off an individual’s access to gas, water or electricity.

The city promised to “keep the public’s best interest in mind” while also handing itself the power to shut down all liquor stores and bars, although Gov. J.B. Pritzker has already ordered the shut down of all bars and schools across Illinois until March 30.
Please read the statement below then watch the excerpt from today’s meeting, which explains what the emergency order entails. The full meeting will be shared on social media and on the City's website shortly as well. https://t.co/MpVhs5woxW pic.twitter.com/Ly0EeNfFht
— City of Champaign (@champaigncity) March 13, 2020

City manager Jeff Hamilton said, “None of the options will necessarily be implemented but are available in order to protect the welfare and safety of our community if needed.”
Illinois currently has 93 confirmed cases of coronavirus statewide.
Attempting to seize Americans’ guns and alcohol during a lockdown quarantine? Yeah, good luck with that.

 Shanghai Government Officially Recommends Vitamin C for COVID-19,"The government of Shanghai, China has announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C. (1)
Dosage recommendations vary with severity of illness, from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 200 mg/kg/day.
These dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV.

This specific method of administration is important, says intravenous therapy expert Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, because vitamin C’s effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally.
Dr. Yanagisawa is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy. He says, “Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.”
Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, a Chinese-American specialist physician, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities throughout China.
He has been instrumental in facilitating at least three Chinese clinical IV vitamin C studies now underway.
Dr. Cheng is presently in Shanghai continuing his efforts to encourage still more Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy incorporating high oral doses as well as C by IV.
Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa both recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19 infection.
An official statement from Xi’an Jiaotong University Second Hospital (2) reads:
“On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital…
“[H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission…
“[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function… Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment…
“[H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).”

" Detect, Deter and Annihilate: How the Police State Will Deal with a Coronavirus Outbreak","“Fear is a primitive impulse, brainless as hunger, and because the aim of horror fiction is the production of the deepest kinds of fears, the genre tends to reinforce some remarkably uncivilized ideas about self-protection.
“In the current crop of zombie stories, the prevailing value for the beleaguered survivors is a sort of siege mentality, a vigilance so constant and unremitting that it’s indistinguishable from the purest paranoia.”— Terrence Rafferty, New York Times
What do zombies have to do with the U.S. government’s plans for dealing with a coronavirus outbreak?
Read on, and I’ll tell you.

The zombie narrative was popularized by the hit television series The Walking Dead, in which a small group of Americans attempt to survive in a zombie-ridden, post-apocalyptic world where they’re not only fighting off flesh-eating ghouls but cannibalistic humans.
For a while there, zombies could be found lurking around every corner: wreaking havoc at gun shows, battling corsets in movies such as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, and running for their lives in 5K charity races.
Understandably, zombie fiction plays to our fears and paranoia, while allowing us to “envision how we and our own would thrive if everything went to hell and we lost all our societal supports.”
Yet as journalist Syreeta McFadden points out, while dystopian stories used to reflect our anxieties, now they reflect our reality, mirroring how we as a nation view the world around us, how we as citizens view each other, and most of all how our government views us.
Indeed, the U.S. government has spent a lot of time and energy in recent years using zombies as the models for a variety of crisis scenarios not too dissimilar from what we are currently experiencing.
For instance, back in 2015, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put together a zombie apocalypse preparation kit “that details everything you would need to have on hand in the event the living dead showed up at your front door.”
The CDC, in conjunction with the Dept. of Defense, even used zombies to put government agents through their paces in mock military drills.
Fear the Walking Dead — AMC’s spinoff of its popular Walking Dead series — drove this point home by dialing back the clock to when the zombie outbreak first appears and setting viewers down in the midst of societal unrest not unlike our own experiences of recent years (“a bunch of weird incidents, police protests, riots, and … rapid social entropy”).
Then, as Forbes reports, “the military showed up and we fast-forwarded into an ad hoc police state with no glimpse at what was happening in the world around our main cast of hapless survivors.”
Forbes found Fear’s quick shift into a police state to be far-fetched, but anyone who has been paying attention in recent years knows that the groundwork was laid long ago for the government — i.e., the military — to intervene and lock down the nation in the event of a national disaster.
We’re seeing this play out now as the coronavirus contagion spreads.
What we have yet to experience (although it may only be a matter of time) is that the government through the imposition of martial law could pose a greater threat to our safety (and our freedoms) than any virus.
As the Atlantic noted about Fear the Walking Dead:
“The villains aren’t the zombies, who rarely appear, but the U.S. military, who sweep into an L.A. suburb to quarantine the survivors. Zombies are, after all, a recognizable threat—but Fear plumbs drama and horror from the betrayal by institutions designed to keep people safe.”
Indeed, zombie fiction perfectly embodies the government’s paranoia about the citizenry as potential threats that need to be monitored, tracked, surveilled, sequestered, deterred, vanquished and rendered impotent.
Why else would the government feel the need to monitor our communications, track our movements, criminalize our every action, treat us like suspects, and strip us of any means of defense while equipping its own personnel with an amazing arsenal of weapons?
For years now, the government has been carrying out military training drills with zombies as the enemy.
In 2011, the DOD created a 31-page instruction manual for how to protect America from a terrorist attack carried out by zombie forces.
In 2012, the CDC released a guide for surviving a zombie plague. That was followed by training drills for members of the military, police officers and first responders.
As journalist Andrea Peyser reports:
Coinciding with Halloween 2012, a five-day national conference was put on by the HALO Corp. in San Diego for more than 1,000 first responders, military personnel and law enforcement types.
It included workshops produced by a Hollywood-affiliated firm in … overcoming a zombie invasion. Actors were made up to look like flesh-chomping monsters. The Department of Homeland Security even paid the $1,000 entry fees for an unknown number of participants…
“Zombie disaster” drills were held in October 2012 and ’13 at California’s Sutter Roseville Medical Center. The exercises allowed medical center staff “to test response to a deadly infectious disease, a mass-casualty event, terrorism event and security procedures”…
[In October 2014], REI outdoor-gear stores in Soho and around the country are to hold free classes in zombie preparedness, which the stores have been providing for about three years.
The zombie exercises appeared to be kitschy and fun — government agents running around trying to put down a zombie rebellion — but what if the zombies in the exercises were us, the citizenry, viewed by those in power as mindless, voracious, zombie hordes?
Consider this: the government started playing around with the idea of using zombies as stand-ins for enemy combatants in its training drills right around the time the Army War College issued its 2008 report, warning that an economic crisis in the U.S. could lead to massive civil unrest that would require the military to intervene and restore order.
That same year, it was revealed that the government had amassed more than 8 million names of Americans considered a threat to national security, to be used “by the military in the event of a national catastrophe, a suspension of the Constitution or the imposition of martial law.”
The program’s name, Main Core, refers to the fact that it contains “copies of the ‘main core’ or essence of each item of intelligence information on Americans produced by the FBI and the other agencies of the U.S. intelligence community.”
Also in 2008, the Pentagon launched the Minerva Initiative, a $75 million military-driven research project focused on studying social behavior in order to determine how best to cope with mass civil disobedience or uprisings.
The Minerva Initiative has funded projects such as “Who Does Not Become a Terrorist, and Why?” which “conflates peaceful activists with ‘supporters of political violence’ who are different from terrorists only in that they do not embark on ‘armed militancy’ themselves.”
In 2009, the Dept. of Homeland Security issued its reports on Rightwing and Leftwing Extremism, in which the terms “extremist” and “terrorist” were used interchangeably to describe citizens they perceived to be disgruntled or anti-government.
Meanwhile, a government campaign was underway to spy on Americans’ mail, email and cell phone communications. News reports indicate that the U.S. Postal Service has handled more than 150,000 requests by federal and state law enforcement agencies to monitor Americans’ mail, in addition to photographing every piece of mail sent through the postal system.
Fast forward a few years more and local police were being transformed into extensions of the military, taught to view members of their community as suspects, trained to shoot first and ask questions later, and equipped with all of the technology and weaponry of a soldier on a battlefield.
The Obama administration then hired a domestic terrorism czar whose job is to focus on anti-government American “extremists” who have been designated a greater threat to America than ISIS or al Qaeda.
As part of the government’s so-called war on right-wing extremism, the Obama administration agreed to partner with the United Nations to take part in its Strong Cities Network program, which is training local police agencies across America in how to identify, fight and prevent extremism.
Nothing has changed for the better under the Trump Administration.
Those who believe in and exercise their rights under the Constitution (namely, the right to speak freely, worship freely, associate with like-minded individuals who share their political views, criticize the government, own a weapon, demand a warrant before being questioned or searched, or any other activity viewed as potentially anti-government, racist, bigoted, anarchic or sovereign), continue to be promoted to the top of the government’s terrorism watch list.
“We the people” or, more appropriately, “we the zombies” are the enemy in the eyes of the government. This coronavirus merely ups the ante.
So when presented with the Defense Department’s battle plan for defeating an army of the walking dead, you might find yourself tempted to giggle over the fact that a taxpayer-funded government bureaucrat actually took the time to research and write about vegetarian zombies, evil magic zombies, chicken zombies, space zombies, bio-engineered weaponized zombies, radiation zombies, symbiant-induced zombies, and pathogenic zombies.
However, in an age of extreme government paranoia, this is no laughing matter.
The DOD’s strategy for dealing with a zombie uprising, outlined in “CONOP 8888,” is for all intents and purposes a training manual for the government in how to put down a citizen uprising or at least an uprising of individuals “infected” with a dangerous disease or dangerous ideas about freedom.
Rest assured that the tactics and difficulties outlined in the “fictional training scenario” are all too real, beginning with martial law.
As the DOD training manual states: “zombies [stand-ins for “we the people”] are horribly dangerous to all human life and zombie infections have the potential to seriously undermine national security and economic activities that sustain our way of life. Therefore having a population that is not composed of zombies or at risk from their malign influence is vital to U.S. and Allied national interests.”
So how does the military plan to put down a zombie (a.k.a. citizen) uprising?
The strategy manual outlines five phases necessary for a counter-offensive: shape, deter, seize initiative, dominate, stabilize and restore civil authority. Here are a few details:
Phase 0 (Shape): Conduct general zombie awareness training. Monitor increased threats (i.e., surveillance). Carry out military drills. Synchronize contingency plans between federal and state agencies. Anticipate and prepare for a breakdown in law and order.
Phase 1 (Deter): Recognize that zombies cannot be deterred or reasoned with. Carry out training drills to discourage other countries from developing or deploying attack zombies and publicly reinforce the government’s ability to combat a zombie threat.
Initiate intelligence sharing between federal and state agencies. Assist the Dept. of Homeland Security in identifying or discouraging immigrants from areas where zombie-related diseases originate.
Phase 2 (Seize initiative): Recall all military personal to their duty stations. Fortify all military outposts. Deploy air and ground forces for at least 35 days.
Carry out confidence-building measures with nuclear-armed peers such as Russia and China to ensure they do not misinterpret the government’s zombie countermeasures as preparations for war. Establish quarantine zones. Distribute explosion-resistant protective equipment. Place the military on red alert.
Begin limited scale military operations to combat zombie threats. Carry out combat operations against zombie populations within the United States that were “previously” U.S. citizens.
Phase 3 (Dominate): Lock down all military bases for 30 days. Shelter all essential government personnel for at least 40 days. Equip all government agents with military protective gear. Issue orders for military to kill all non-human life on sight.
Initiate bomber and missile strikes against targeted sources of zombie infection, including the infrastructure. Burn all zombie corpses. Deploy military to lock down the beaches and waterways.
Phase 4 (Stabilize): Send out recon teams to check for remaining threats and survey the status of basic services (water, power, sewage infrastructure, air, and lines of communication).
Execute a counter-zombie ISR plan to ID holdout pockets of zombie resistance. Use all military resources to target any remaining regions of zombie holdouts and influence. Continue all actions from the Dominate phase.
Phase 5 (Restore civil authority): Deploy military personnel to assist any surviving civil authorities in disaster zones.
Reconstitute combat capabilities at various military bases. Prepare to redeploy military forces to attack surviving zombie holdouts. Restore basic services in disaster areas.
Notice the similarities?
Surveillance. Military drills. Awareness training. Militarized police forces. Martial law.
As I point out in my book, Battlefield America: The War on the American People, if there is any lesson to be learned, it is simply this: whether the threat to national security comes in the form of imaginary zombies, actual terrorists, American citizens infected with the coronavirus, or disgruntled American citizens infected with dangerous ideas about freedom, the government’s response to such threats remains the same: detect, deter and annihilate.

 Suspending the Constitution: Police State Uses Crises to Expand Its Lockdown Powers,"“That was when they suspended the Constitution. They said it would be temporary. There wasn’t even any rioting in the streets. People stayed home at night, watching television, looking for some direction. There wasn’t even an enemy you could put your finger on.”― Margaret Atwood, The Handmaid’s Tale
You can always count on the government to take advantage of a crisis, legitimate or manufactured.
This coronavirus pandemic is no exception.

Not only are the federal and state governments unraveling the constitutional fabric of the nation with lockdown mandates that are sending the economy into a tailspin and wreaking havoc with our liberties, but they are also rendering the citizenry fully dependent on the government for financial handouts, medical intervention, protection and sustenance.
Unless we find some way to rein in the government’s power grabs, the fall-out will be epic.
Everything I have warned about for years — government overreach, invasive surveillance, martial law, abuse of powers, militarized police, weaponized technology used to track and control the citizenry, and so on—has coalesced into this present moment.
The government’s shameless exploitation of past national emergencies for its own nefarious purposes pales in comparison to what is presently unfolding.
It’s downright Machiavellian.
Deploying the same strategy it used with 9/11 to acquire greater powers under the USA Patriot Act, the police state — a.k.a. the shadow government, a.k.a. the Deep State — has been anticipating this moment for years, quietly assembling a wish list of lockdown powers that could be trotted out and approved at a moment’s notice.
It should surprise no one, then, that the Trump Administration has asked Congress to allow it to suspend parts of the Constitution whenever it deems it necessary during this coronavirus pandemic and “other” emergencies.
It’s that “other” emergencies part that should particularly give you pause, if not spur you to immediate action (by action, I mean a loud and vocal, apolitical, nonpartisan outcry and sustained, apolitical, nonpartisan resistance).
In fact, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has been quietly trotting out and testing a long laundry list of terrifying powers that override the Constitution.
We’re talking about lockdown powers (at both the federal and state level): the ability to suspend the Constitution, indefinitely detain American citizens, bypass the courts, quarantine whole communities or segments of the population, override the First Amendment by outlawing religious gatherings and assemblies of more than a few people, shut down entire industries and manipulate the economy, muzzle dissidents, “stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease,” reshape financial markets, create a digital currency (and thus further restrict the use of cash), determine who should live or die…
You’re getting the picture now, right?
These are powers the police state would desperately like to make permanent.
Specifically, the DOJ wants to be able to indefinitely detain American citizens without trial. The DOJ also wants to be able to pause court proceedings and suspend the statute of limitations on criminal and civil cases.
Both signify a clear violation of every right espoused in the Constitution, including habeas corpus.
Habeas corpus, a fundamental tenet of English common law that guards against arbitrary and lawless state action, does not appear anywhere in the Bill of Rights.
Its importance was such that it was enshrined in the Constitution itself. And it is of such magnitude that all other rights, including those in the Bill of Rights, are dependent upon it. Without habeas corpus, the significance of all other rights crumbles.
The right of habeas corpus was important to the Framers of the Constitution because they knew from personal experience what it was like to be labeled enemy combatants, imprisoned indefinitely and not given the opportunity to appear before a neutral judge.
Believing that such arbitrary imprisonment is “in all ages, the favorite and most formidable instrument of tyranny,” the Founders were all the more determined to protect Americans from such government abuses.
Translated as “you should have the body,” habeas corpus is a legal action, or writ, by which those imprisoned unlawfully can seek relief from their imprisonment.
Derived from English common law, habeas corpus first appeared in the Magna Carta of 1215 and is the oldest human right in the history of English-speaking civilization. The doctrine of habeas corpus stems from the requirement that a government must either charge a person or let him go free.
While serving as President, Thomas Jefferson addressed the essential necessity of habeas corpus. In his first inaugural address on March 4, 1801, Jefferson said:
“I know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a republican government cannot be strong; that this government is not strong enough.” But, said Jefferson, our nation was “the world’s best hope” and, because of our strong commitment to democracy, “the strongest government on earth.”
Jefferson said that the sum of this basic belief was found in the “freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus; and trial by juries impartially selected. These principles form the bright constellation which has gone before us, and guided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation.”
Throughout the twentieth century, the importance of the right of habeas corpus has repeatedly been confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Yet, 200-plus years after America’s founders risked their lives to secure their freedoms, we find ourselves right back where we started, with a government determined to strip us of every vestige of our freedoms.
The DOJ’s latest request to Congress is merely a signal that the police state is ready to step out of the shadows, with the current national emergency being a convenient cover for their dastardly deeds.
Bear in mind, however, that these powers the Trump Administration, acting on orders from the police state, are officially asking Congress to recognize and authorize barely scratch the surface of the far-reaching powers the government has already unilaterally claimed for itself.
Unofficially, the police state has been riding roughshod over the rule of law for years now without any pretense of being reined in or restricted in its power grabs by Congress, the courts or the citizenry.
As David C. Unger, observes in The Emergency State: America’s Pursuit of Absolute Security at All Costs:
“For seven decades we have been yielding our most basic liberties to a secretive, unaccountable emergency state – a vast but increasingly misdirected complex of national security institutions, reflexes, and beliefs that so define our present world that we forget that there was ever a different America. …
“Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness have given way to permanent crisis management: to policing the planet and fighting preventative wars of ideological containment, usually on terrain chosen by, and favorable to, our enemies.
“Limited government and constitutional accountability have been shouldered aside by the kind of imperial presidency our constitutional system was explicitly designed to prevent.”
This rise of an “emergency state” that justifies all manner of government tyranny in the so-called name of national security is all happening according to schedule.
The civil unrest, the national emergencies, “unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters,” the government’s reliance on the armed forces to solve domestic political and social problems, the implicit declaration of martial law packaged as a well-meaning and overriding concern for the nation’s security: the powers-that-be have been planning and preparing for such a crisis for years now, not just with active shooter drills and lockdowns and checkpoints and heightened danger alerts, but with a sensory overload of militarized, battlefield images — in video games, in movies, on the news—that acclimate us to life in a police state.
Whether or not this particular crisis is of the government’s own making is not the point: to those for whom power and profit are everything, the end always justifies the means.
The seeds of this present madness were sown several decades ago when George W. Bush stealthily issued two presidential directives that granted the president the power to unilaterally declare a national emergency, which is loosely defined as “any incident, regardless of location, that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties, damage, or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population, infrastructure, environment, economy, or government functions.“
Comprising the country’s Continuity of Government (COG) plan, these directives (National Security Presidential Directive 51 and Homeland Security Presidential Directive 20), which do not need congressional approval, provide a skeletal outline of the actions the president will take in the event of a “national emergency.”
Mind you, that national emergency can take any form, can be manipulated for any purpose and can be used to justify any end goal—all on the say so of the president.
Just what sort of actions the president will take once he declares a national emergency can barely be discerned from the barebones directives.
However, one thing is clear: in the event of a national emergency, the president will become a dictator because while the COG directives ensure the continuity of executive branch functions, they do not provide for repopulating or reconvening Congress or the Supreme Court.
Thus, a debilitating attack would give unchecked executive, legislative and judicial power to the executive branch and its unelected minions. The country would then be subjected to martial law by default, and the Constitution and the Bill of Rights would be suspended.
Originally devised as a plan for quickly restoring constitutional government, the COG concept arose during the Cold War. The fear was that a nuclear strike would paralyze the federal government.
These concerns continued into the 1980s.
Under President Ronald Reagan, an elaborate plan was created in which three teams consisting of a cabinet member, an executive chief of staff and military and intelligence officials would practice evacuating and directing a counter nuclear strike against the Soviet Union from a variety of high-tech, mobile command vehicles.
If the president and vice president were both killed, one of these teams would take control, with the ranking cabinet official serving as president.
Among those Reagan handpicked to advise an inexperienced and potentially incompetent successor in a time of crisis were Congressman Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, then a business executive with G. D. Searle & Co.
At least once a year during the 1980s, Cheney and Rumsfeld vanished on top-secret training missions, where each of the teams practiced evacuating and directing a counter nuclear strike against Russia.
This all changed after the attacks of September 11, 2001, when it became clear that the assumptions that drove COG planning during the Cold War no longer applied: there would be no warning against a so-called “terrorist” attack.
Thus, instead of relying on part-time bureaucrats and evacuation schematics, the Bush administration permanently appointed executive officials, stationed outside the capital, to run a shadow government.
The U.S. military has reportedly already been given standby orders under COG for this present coronavirus pandemic.
The plans for the shadow government administered by those who run the Deep State are more elaborate than many realize. Massive underground bunkers the size of small cities are sprinkled throughout the country for the government elite to escape to in the event of a national emergency.
Mount Weather, near Bluemont, Va., is one of a number of such facilities. Built into the side of a mountain, this bunker contains, among other things, a hospital, crematorium, dining and recreation areas, sleeping quarters, reservoirs of drinking and cooling water, an emergency power plant and a radio/television studio.
There is also an Office of the Presidency at Mount Weather, which regularly receives top-secret national security information from all the federal departments and agencies. This facility was largely unknown to everyone, including Congress, until it came to light in the mid-1970s.
Military personnel connected to the bunker have refused to reveal any information about it, even before congressional committees. In fact, Congress has no oversight, budgetary or otherwise, on Mount Weather, and the specifics of the facility remain top-secret.
What is the bottom line here?
We are, for all intents and purposes, one crisis away from having a full-fledged authoritarian state emerge from the shadows, at which time democratic government will be dissolved and the country will be ruled by an unelected bureaucracy.
This is exactly the kind of mischief that Thomas Jefferson warned against when he cautioned:
“In questions of power, then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.”
Power corrupts.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Thus far, we have at least pretended that the government abides by the Constitution.
Those who wrote our Constitution sought to ensure our freedoms by creating a document that protects our God-given rights at all times, even when we are engaged in war, whether that is a so-called war on terrorism, a so-called war on drugs, a so-called war on illegal immigration, or a so-called war on disease.
The attempts by each successive presidential administration to rule by fiat merely plays into the hands of those who would distort the government’s system of checks and balances and its constitutional separation of powers beyond all recognition.
Remember, these powers do not expire at the end of a president’s term. They remain on the books, just waiting to be used or abused by the next political demagogue.
So, too, every action taken by Trump and his predecessors to weaken the system of checks and balances, sidestep the rule of law, and expand the power of the executive branch of government has made us that much more vulnerable to those who would abuse those powers in the future.
Although the Constitution invests the President with very specific, limited powers, in recent years, American presidents (Trump, Obama, Bush, Clinton, etc.) have claimed the power to completely and almost unilaterally alter the landscape of this country for good or for ill.
The Trump Administration’s willingness to circumvent the Constitution by leaning heavily on the president’s so-called emergency powers constitutes a gross perversion of what limited power the Constitution affords the executive branch.
The powers amassed by each successive president through the negligence of Congress and the courts — powers which add up to a toolbox of terror for an imperial ruler — empower whomever occupies the Oval Office to act as a dictator, above the law and beyond any real accountability.
As law professor William P. Marshall explains, “every extraordinary use of power by one President expands the availability of executive branch power for use by future Presidents.”
Moreover, it doesn’t even matter whether other presidents have chosen not to take advantage of any particular power, because “it is a President’s action in using power, rather than forsaking its use, that has the precedential significance.”
In other words, each successive president continues to add to his office’s list of extraordinary orders and directives, expanding the reach and power of the presidency and granting him- or herself near dictatorial powers.
This abuse of presidential powers has been going on for so long that it has become the norm, the Constitution be damned.
We no longer have a system of checks and balances.
“The system of checks and balances that the Framers envisioned now lacks effective checks and is no longer in balance,” concludes Marshall.
“The implications of this are serious. The Framers designed a system of separation of powers to combat government excess and abuse and to curb incompetence. They also believed that, in the absence of an effective separation-of-powers structure, such ills would inevitably follow. Unfortunately, however, power once taken is not easily surrendered.”
All of the imperial powers amassed by Barack Obama and George W. Bush and now Trump — to kill American citizens without due process, to detain suspects (including American citizens) indefinitely, to strip Americans of their citizenship rights, to carry out mass surveillance on Americans without probable cause, to wage wars without congressional authorization, to suspend laws during wartime, to disregard laws with which he might disagree, to conduct secret wars and convene secret courts, to sanction torture, to sidestep the legislatures and courts with executive orders and signing statements, to direct the military to operate beyond the reach of the law, to establish a standing army on American soil, to operate a shadow government, to declare national emergencies for any manipulated reason, and to act as a dictator and a tyrant, above the law and beyond any real accountability — have become a permanent part of the president’s toolbox of terror.
These presidential powers — acquired through the use of executive orders, decrees, memorandums, proclamations, national security directives and legislative signing statements and which can be activated by any sitting president — enable past, president and future presidents to operate above the law and beyond the reach of the Constitution.
Think on this: the presidential election is right around the corner.
Suddenly, the improbable possibility of any incumbent president attempting to extend the police state’s stranglehold on power by using current events to justify postponing or doing away with an election — forfeiting the people’s rights to govern altogether — and establishing a totalitarian regime seems less far-fetched than it did even a few years ago.
The emergency state is now out in the open for all to see. Unfortunately, “we the people” refuse to see what’s before us.
Most Americans, fearful and easily controlled, would sooner rouse themselves to fight for that last roll of toilet paper than they would their own freedoms.
This is how freedom dies.
We erect our own prison walls, and as our rights dwindle away, we forge our own chains of servitude to the police state.
Be warned, however: once you surrender your freedoms to the government — no matter how compelling the reason might be for doing so — you can never get them back.
As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, no government willingly relinquishes power.
If we continue down this road, there can be no surprise about what awaits us at the end.
The America metamorphosing before our eyes is almost unrecognizable from the country I grew up in, and that’s not just tragic — it’s downright terrifying.

 China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesman Claims “US Army” May Have Started Coronavirus Outbreak in Wuhan,"China’s Foreign Ministry spokesman has sensationally blamed the U.S. Army for starting the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.
The day after President Donald Trump shut down travel from European countries for 30 days, Zhao Lijian made the outlandish assertion that the U.S. itself was responsible for starting the pandemic.
“It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,” tweeted Lijian, adding “Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!”

His tweet included the testimony of CDC Director Robert Redfield to the House Oversight Committee, in which Redfield revealed that early COVID-19 cases in the United States were initially mistaken for regular influenza.

“CDC was caught on the spot. When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals?” asked Lijian.

“So it appears the official Chinese party line is now that the virus originated in the United States!” comments Zero Hedge.
Apparently, Lijian has a history of making outrageous claims but this one probably tops them all.
Whether or not the ruling Communist Party echoes his sentiments remains to be seen.

" Daughter Claims Her Family Was Saved From COVID-19 by Vitamin C — MSM, WHO and Tech Giants All Say It’s ‘Fake News’","Given the state of media watchdogs these days, I will say right off the top, I am not claiming that Vitamin C can cure or protect you from coronavirus / COVID-19, nor is the doctor featured in this article.
Regardless, I do believe when it comes to journalism and helping people explore how to thrive, stories should be told.
Before we get into the story below, note that having fear, stress or panic about contracting any virus is not going to help your immune system, and so the first thing you can do is utilize various techniques to maintain calm if the coronavirus news happens to be inducing stress.

Breathing techniques, for example, can be helpful in reducing stress. Breathe in for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds. Repeat.
At the moment, there is a lot of effort being put in by mainstream media, the WHO, tech giants and fact checkers to claim that any mention of vitamin C as a possible treatment is “fake news.” This is the case even when content isn’t claiming that Vitamin C is a cure, but instead simply shares information and poses questions.
This is simply not true, as clinical trials examining the efficacy to treat the the virus have already begun.
Just One Example: Clinical Trials Of Intravenous Vitamin C Treatments For Coronavirus Commence In China
According to the doctor in the video below, three in China have already begun, as he states on his Youtube channel in multiple videos that he has posted.
CNBC article discussing how big tech and the WHO works to shut down talks about vitamin C.
Regardless of that, it’s important to continue to have this conversation even if that means having your reach and revenue cut down as a publisher. Although it shouldn’t be, we are not claiming anything here but rather presenting information from a Doctor that is currently in China and directly involved with investigations.
Below is a story from Dr. Richard Cheng, a US board-certified anti-aging specialist, from Shanghai, China. He discusses a case where he spoke to a patient in Wuhan whose mother had contracted COVID-19. In the video, he discusses the timeline of events, how the family went about treatment and who in the family got sick.
This is of course an anecdotal case, but given the 3 clinical trials going on in China right now using Vitamin C as a treatment for coronavirus, this adds to the ever-mounting evidence that vitamin C may help treat the virus. Once again, this is still unproven, we can’t say it can, but at the same time we can not say it cannot either.
“They plan to give 6,000 mg/day and 12,000 mg/day per day for moderate and severe cases. We are also communicating with other hospitals about starting more intravenous vitamin C clinical studies. We would like to see oral vitamin C included in these studies, as the oral forms can be applied to more patients and at home.” — Dr. Richard Cheng. Additional information here.

 Bill Gates & World Economic Forum Ran Coronavirus Outbreak Simulation Just 6 Weeks Before the Real Outbreak,"Bombshell Update: Chinese Government ALSO Ran A Coronavirus Drill, In Wuhan — Exactly Where The Actual Outbreak Started
In this report we take an inside look at Event 201, which took place in NYC on October 18 2019.
Event 201 is a high-level pandemic exercise hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
This is extremely fascinating because this pandemic simulation exercise of coronavirus took place about 6 weeks before the first illness from the coronavirus was actually reported in Wuhan, China.
That is one hell of a coincidence if you believe in that sort of thing.

Another fascinating connection is the fact that not only did the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation participate in and help set up the pandemic simulation of a coronavirus outbreak, but they just so happen to fund the group who owns the patent to the deadly coronavirus and are already working on a vaccine to solve the current crisis.
Again, an incredible coincidence…

In this report you will see footage from inside the event from the members of the emergency epidemic board in this simulation consisting of representatives from major banks, the UN, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Johnson and Johnson, logistical powerhouses, the media as well as officials from China and America’s CDC just to name a few.
This simulation also includes news reports that were fabricated just for this exercise — please keep that in mind because they are eerily similar to reports we are currently seeing regarding this real-world coronavirus outbreak.

This is the original video (it’s probably not going to be up for much longer, or, at the very least, the comment section is going to be closed):

" Bill Gates Funded the PIRBRIGHT Institute, Which Owns A Patent On Coronavirus; The CDC Owns The Strain Isolated From Humans","Believe it or not, a coronavirus strain is a patented by the The Pirbright Institute, which is partially funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Another strain, which was isolated from humans, is owned by the CDC.
The patent page for coronavirus explains that it “may be used as a vaccine for treating and/or preventing a disease, such as infectious bronchitis, in a subject,” suggesting that this is just another weaponized viral strain designed to sell more useless, deadly vaccines, while at the same time killing off a few thousand, or perhaps a few million, people.
A close look at the patent page also shows that the Pirbright Institute owns all sorts of other virus patents, including one for African swine fever virus, which is listed as a “vaccine.”

It is thus no surprise that Bill Gates is a Pirbright Institute financial backer, seeing as how he’s one of the most aggressive, vaccine-pushing “philanthropists” on the planet.

And here is another patent for Coronavirus, isolated from humans — Patent US7220852B1 – CORONAVIRUS a.k.a. SARS. The patent was granted to the CDC and the “inventors” are all American:
Patent US7220852B1 – CORONAVIRUS a.k.a. SARS
You can download the above patent HERE [.pdf].
The way this whole coronavirus situation is taking shape would seem to be exactly what Gates once proposed as a “solution” to the alleged problem of “overpopulation.”
At an infamous TED Talk, Gates explained that vaccines are one of the keys to reducing global population levels, and what better way to do that than to unleash patented coronavirus on the masses in order to later introduce a patented vaccine for it?

Bill and Melinda Gates hosted “Event 201” back in October, described as a “high-level pandemic exercise”
What’s further interesting is that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation co-hosted a “high-level pandemic exercise” back in October that involved discussions about how “public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences.”
Held in partnership with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the World Economic Forum, this latest endeavor by Bill Gates is highly suspicious, to say the least, especially when considering that it was held just in time for the coronavirus outbreak.
As is usually the case with suspicious disease outbreaks that get the media and academia talking about new vaccines and public-private partnerships, Bill Gates’ fingerprints are almost always hiding in the background.
And this is exactly the case with coronaviruses, which could accomplish many of Gates’ expectations for the future, including mass depopulation, mass vaccination and mass consolidation of government power.
“These events are increasing, and they are disruptive to health, economies, and society,” reads an announcement about “Event 201,” as they called it, or the meeting with Gates and his cronies from back in October.
“Managing these events already strains global capacity, even absent a pandemic threat. Experts agree that it is only a matter of time before one of these pandemics becomes global – a pandemic with potentially catastrophic consequences. A severe pandemic, which becomes ‘Event 201,’ would require reliable cooperation among several industries, national governments, and key international institutions.”
This reads like a predictive script for what we’re now seeing with coronavirus, as governments around the world scramble to “manage” this deadly outbreak with martial law, vaccine fast-tracking, quarantines and plenty of fear-mongering.
“If we do a really great job on vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower [the global population] by perhaps about 10 to 15 percent,” Gates is infamously quoted as saying about the true intent of his “humanitarian” efforts.

" Head of Wuhan Hospital Dies of Coronavirus as Global Death Toll Rises to Nearly 1,900","The director of a hospital at the epicenter of China’s coronavirus outbreak has died, according to state media, marking the latest death as Beijing scrambles to contain the virus.
Liu Zhiming, the director of Wuchang Hospital in Wuhan, died on Tuesday morning after “all-out rescue efforts failed,” state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Liu’s death was initially announced on Monday night in a social media post by the Hubei Health Commission.

However, in a follow-up message the commission said that the hospital director was alive and battling the virus.
At least six other medical workers in China have died from the virus, while an additional 1,716 have been infected, AFP reported, citing official figures.
The death toll from coronavirus has reached 1,873, with nearly half of China’s population subject to quarantines or other restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the virus.
According to the latest figures, there are 73,325 confirmed cases of the virus worldwide – the vast majority in mainland China.

" Coronavirus, AIDS, And The Politics Of Viral Fear","In the 1980’s, agenda-driven panic around the HIV epidemic set back the public health response by years.
Nothing is more viral than fear. Fear — fight or flight – is a terrible way to make decisions that call for time, science, and rational thinking.
Want to screw up a public health crisis? Let fear drive.

Democrats, Pavlovian conditioned by years of believing everything Trump does is “an existential threat,” are about twice as likely as Republicans to say the coronavirus poses an imminent danger.
Make a joke of it — pandemic or Dempanic — but one’s political party should not affect how we respond to an epidemic.
“Our hyper-polarization is so strong that we don’t even assess a potential health crisis in the same way. And so it impedes our ability to address it,” said Jennifer McCoy, a Georgia State political science professor who studies polarization.
“I am not scared of Covid-19,” Abdu Sharkawy, an infectious disease expert at the University of Toronto in Canada, wrote. “I am scared about the loss of reason and wave of fear that has induced the masses of society into a spellbinding spiral of panic.”
This is not about downplaying something serious. It is about preventing mistakes that will make things worse. Trump Derangement Syndrome might actually help kill us this time, as fear makes for poor public health decisions.
Remember the 1980’s?
In 1981 the CDC reported five cases of a new pneumonia. The disease didn’t even have a name until the next year, and wasn’t isolated in the lab until 1984. AIDS would go on to kill over 500,000 Americans.
Yet while a horrible disease and a miserable way to die, in retrospect “the problem with AIDS was really two epidemics — the real health epidemic and the epidemic of the mind,” said Boston’s WBZ-TV station manager Tom Goodgame, quoted in Time.
Meanwell, The New York Times concluded, “in the 1980’s, fear spread faster than AIDS.” America paid the price in lives.
The fear was measurable. In the mid-80’s 60 percent of Americans wanted HIV+ people to carry a card noting their status; one in three said employers should fire employees who had AIDS.
Some 21 percent said people with AIDS should be isolated from the rest of society in leper colonies.
Even a professional medical journal wrote, “A specter is haunting our streets — the specter of AIDS, a remorseless and incurable disease whose nature, transmission and effects still contain elements of mystery.”
Those mysteries are always the most dangerous elements in shaping public health policy via fear, and with AIDS, centered on exaggerating the problem.
When early cases surfaced inside communities already viewed as modern day Sodoms, many sought to exaggerate the crisis from a quasi-religious point of view: God was smiting the gays.
Tragically, too many felt the more who died of AIDS the better, and played up the deaths as “Judgement.” The rest of us, God-fearing, were safe.
Homophobia manifested as fear crushed human compassion.
It’s almost like hoping the current economy goes into recession, destroying the savings of millions of Americans, so Trump’s chances of reelection fall. Or one politician hoping the virus infects those at MAGA rallies.
In the 1980’s, the Reagan administration, with its political debt to newly-empowered evangelical voters, was indifferent at best toward the study or prevention of AIDS.
Congress agreed; in 1987 it banned the use of federal funds for AIDS prevention and education that “promoted or encouraged, directly or indirectly, homosexual activities.”
Years were lost as the virus spread, and too many died because of the delay in funding.
We were not innocent. In the mid-to-late 1980s “AIDS hysteria” was a familiar term in the media and public life, and popular comedians made crude jokes to amuse us.
A study found “health care trainees and professionals demonstrated their level of empathy and caring for HIV/AIDS is negatively affected by the knowledge that the person being treated is homosexual.”
A 1985 Time magazine story, “The New Untouchables,” focused on an incident in New York where parents refused to send their children to a school after one student was identified as HIV+.
“What about somebody sneezing in the classroom? What about the water fountain? What about kids who get in a fight with a bloody nose? They don’t know!” said one frightened parent.
Gay activists also sought to drive public opinion through fear. The fear of a “heterosexual breakout” was employed to coax a Middle American audience toward political awareness.
The community also exaggerated the crisis as spur to more government funding.
In 1988, after New York revised its estimates of HIV+ citizens significantly downward, members of AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power were arrested at a sit-in at the Health Department.
Hecklers trailed the Health Commissioner demanding he resign. His home was picketed and spray-painted. There were death threats against him.
Yet statistical studies some 30 years later showed even his lower numbers from the 1980s overestimated the extent of the epidemic by some 50 percent. The Commissioner had been right to tamp down the threat.
Activists justify their use of fear as the only way to have focused attention on the disease. But that ignores the tragic results of their actions.
While funding did increase, much of the government’s early AIDS-prevention budget was used to raise awareness among hetero college students, women, and others who faced relatively low risk. Money was diverted away from the communities that needed it most.
Even today, AIDS and other fear-mongered diseases soak up a disproportionate share of research funds. Diseases that account for 84 percent of deaths in the U.S. get less than half of NIH funding.
Cancer and HIV/AIDS in particular receive a disproportionately large amount, while chronic diseases like diabetes and obesity receive less funding relative to the costs they impose on society.
The worry is always the unknown, and on Day One of an epidemic nearly everything is unknown. Mistakes get made as protocols are created (in reality, field tested) on the fly.
Japan, with an excellent universal health care system and a non-partisan public health bureaucracy, miserably mishandled a cruise ship quarantine, turning the boat into a virus incubator.
Remember when people believed they should not shake hands with a gay man for fear of catching the disease? Only when science replaced fear did AIDS subside to where today the disease is a manageable element of public health.
“AIDS is grim enough without exaggeration,” cited one New York Times editorial 1987. It continued:
“Why has the truth disappeared so far from view? Perhaps because the chief interpreters of the data want to reflect their own messages. Public health experts see a unique chance to reduce all sexually transmitted diseases.
“Medical researchers demand $1 billion in new Federal spending against AIDS, hoping to refurbish their laboratories. Government epidemiologists, seeking to protect homosexuals and drug addicts, fear the Reagan Administration may acquire the notion that these are the only people at risk.
“Moralists see a heaven-sent chance to preach fire, brimstone and restricted sex. Homosexuals have no desire to carry the stigma of AIDS alone.”
While fear as a political manipulative tool is nothing new, the coronavirus panic appears at a new place in America. Social media encourages people Joker-like to pour fuel on fires.
MSM pursues an unambiguous political agenda when it is not just peddling raw anxiety as a profit center. We are ever more diverse and ever more subreddit separated. It isn’t safe anymore for us to have common fears.
Wash your hands. Ask questions. But keep fear in check.
As you encounter information focusing on worst-case scenarios, which seems to exaggerate unknowns, uses terms like surge, crash, skyrocket, Katrina, is more White House gossip than science, anything that starts with Report: ask yourself if the primary purpose is peddling fear — to sell you a product, to get you to click, to influence your vote.
Socially isolate yourself from that source.
And stop reading political journalists to learn about a health issue.
Politico, currently bleating out Trump isn’t doing enough and is bungling what he is doing, was only recently criticizing Trump’s prescient travel ban for China travelers as ineffective, and worried it would antagonize Chinese leaders.
I write this from New York, under a declared state of emergency.
Yet for all the screaming headlines one finds the primary motivation for the declaration was simply “a more expedited purchasing and testing protocol.”
It’s more about a better bureaucracy now than something with sirens and flashing lights now.
The numbers will go up until they start going down (new cases are declining in China and South Korea.)
There is nothing investors fear more than uncertainty, kryptonite to the markets. Right now that is all there is and volatility in the markets will continue until uncertainty, and then fear, back off.
Before you blame someone or something, figure out how to blame away the virus in China, Italy, Iran, and elsewhere where they don’t have Trump, and do have universal healthcare, sick leave or whatever other partisan talking point is being pushed.
Panic is easy, a measured response hard. We need to make good decisions. Lives depend on it.

Two key points which could potentially be a game changer for this coronavirus outbreak. Number one, a Yale study conducted by several Chinese doctors and scientists of the 2019 novel coronavirus clearly states that the virus has a 3- to 24-day incubation period.
Currently, the quarantine time has been set at 14 days, so according to this study, people who could have been exposed to the virus and completed the 14-day quarantine and were released, could possibly still be infected for another 10 days while showing no symptoms, but is still being contagious, possibly infecting others.
Second, it appears that it is possible to contract the virus a second time, with even more dangerous results than the first time.

 Commissioner Calls Out Mayor for Cutting Off People’s Power During COVID-19 Outbreak,"Lake Worth Beach, FL — Over the last 10 days, across the country, millions of Americans have watched as their careers in restaurants, bars, barber shops, spas, and many other businesses came crashing down. Many of these folks live paycheck to paycheck and have just received their last one. Of these folks, many of them have children.
Imagine for an instant that you have just received your last paycheck, your rent is due and you don’t have enough to cover your utility bill for your family.
You pay only your rent to keep your roof over your head and the government responsible for your unemployment then cuts off your power.

A Lake Worth Beach, Florida city commissioner attempted to stop such a scenario from unfolding earlier this month by holding an emergency meeting to discontinue shutoffs of water and electric to city residents with derelict accounts during the crisis.
However, that emergency meeting was denied and as a result, dozens of residents had their utilities shut off.
That commissioner was Omari Hardy who is now going viral in a video in which he calls out the mayor during a later meeting — after residents had their power cut off.
During the meeting, Hardy slammed Lake Worth Beach city manager Michael Bornstein who admitted to turning off electricity for 50 customers on Tuesday. He also accused the mayor, Pam Triolo of holding a “banana republic.”
“Lake Worth is 10 minutes from Mar-a-Lago, but we’re the second-poorest city in Palm Beach County,” Hardy said, referring to President Trump’s resort.
“Our working-class families may have seen their last paycheck for the foreseeable future. It doesn’t seem right to turn off their electricity in the middle of a pandemic.”
Hardy went on to note that the city slow played their reaction in spite mass unemployment amid the crisis.
“We could have banned large public gatherings, we could have closed the beach, we could have put a moratorium on utility cutoffs,” Hardy said.
“We should have been talking about this last week. We cut off people’s utilities this week and made them pay what could have been their last paycheck to us to turn their lights on. But you don’t care about that! You didn’t want to meet.”
Not wanting to hear anymore of Hardy’s words, the mayor called the meeting to a recess.
“Also not within your power,” Hardy retorted.
“You came up with new rules at the beginning of the meeting and then you didn’t even want to follow the rules you came up with. This is a banana republic is what you’re turning this place into with your so-called leadership.”
While being scolded by the commissioner, the mayor got up and walked away.
“You’re done. You’re done,” Triolo said. “Disrespectful.”
“You call me disrespectful because I’ve interrupted people,” Hardy said to Triolo while gesturing toward Bornstein. “But this gentleman has turned off people’s lights in the middle of a global health pandemic. That’s what that gentleman did. And you think I’m disrespectful.”
Video of the incident subsequently went viral with Hardy becoming a hero to many.
“Idk who Omari Hardy is, but make him president,” one person wrote on Twitter.
“Omari Hardy For President,” another said. “That lady couldn’t handle all that truth in her face.”
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hardy said he doesn’t regret what he said, only noting that he wished he would not have yelled.
“I didn’t know how to feel about it,” Hardy said.
“I felt I said what needed to be said, but I wish I didn’t have to yell it. I don’t regret the words, but I regret the circumstances that led to what was a very disagreeable situation.”
Luckily, for those affected by the crisis, Lake Worth Beach has since enacted a moratorium on utility shut offs and residents who had their electricity shut off have since had it turned back on.

" In America, Those Who Prepare for Uncertain Times Are Vilified","The continued spread of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) all around the world has driven many people to stockpile necessities like toilet paper and water just in case supplies run short.
But rather than applaud these folks for thinking ahead and trying to prepare for the worst, both the media and the government are chastising these “preppers” for being “selfish” and “hoarding.”
As mass quarantines loom and medical martial law is gradually unveiled, the last thing Americans need to be doing right now is continuing on with business as usual, pretending as though nothing is happening.

But this is what the Trump White House wants people to do as it reassures everyone that all is well, and urges them to just sit tight while the government supposedly handles everything.
USA Today, as one prominent media example, recently published an article telling readers to basically do nothing at all because nothing bad is supposedly going to happen.
Just keep watching Netflix, drinking your favorite brews at the local craft brewery, and gorging yourself to death on whatever other distractions are put before you and you’ll be just fine, is the gist of it.
“Keep calm and stop hoarding,” the article reads.
“The spread of coronavirus in the U.S. won’t wipe out our toilet paper supply. Or supplies of hand sanitizer, bottled water and ramen … That is, unless the frenzied stampedes for hand sanitizer and bottled water continue at their current pace.”
All throughout this same article are rhetorical barbs like “impulsive buying binges,” “air of aggressive competition,” “stripping store shelves of toilet paper,” and “the crush of humanity” at Costco, which are designed to make the reader feel as through preparing for a worst-case scenario is both mindless and foolish. But is it really?
Last we checked, there’s nothing at all “irresponsible,” to borrow another USA Today jab, about having a few extra things on hand in case they run out during a crisis.
Would you rather be crippled with basically nothing in the event of a collapse, or have a reasonable stockpile of life-saving food, water, sanitary supplies, and medicines should the excrement hit the fan?

 Ron Paul: “The Coronavirus Hoax”,"by Ron Paul
Governments love crises because when the people are fearful they are more willing to give up freedoms for promises that the government will take care of them.
After 9/11, for example, Americans accepted the near-total destruction of their civil liberties in the PATRIOT Act’s hollow promises of security.
It is ironic to see the same Democrats who tried to impeach President Trump last month for abuse of power demanding that the Administration grab more power and authority in the name of fighting a virus that thus far has killed less than 100 Americans.

Declaring a pandemic emergency on Friday, President Trump now claims the power to quarantine individuals suspected of being infected by the virus and, as Politico writes, “stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease.” He can even call out the military to cordon off a US city or state.
State and local authoritarians love panic as well. The mayor of Champaign, Illinois, signed an executive order declaring the power to ban the sale of guns and alcohol and cut off gas, water, or electricity to any citizen.
The governor of Ohio just essentially closed his entire state.
The chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration is without a doubt Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.
Fauci is all over the media, serving up outright falsehoods to stir up even more panic. He testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is ten times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.
On Face the Nation, Fauci did his best to further damage an already tanking economy by stating, “Right now, personally, myself, I wouldn’t go to a restaurant.” He has pushed for closing the entire country down for 14 days.
Over what? A virus that has thus far killed just over 5,000 worldwide and less than 100 in the United States?
By contrast, tuberculosis, an old disease not much discussed these days, killed nearly 1.6 million people in 2017. Where’s the panic over this?
If anything, what people like Fauci and the other fearmongers are demanding will likely make the disease worse.
The martial law they dream about will leave people hunkered down inside their homes instead of going outdoors or to the beach where the sunshine and fresh air would help boost immunity.
The panic produced by these fearmongers is likely helping spread the disease, as massive crowds rush into Walmart and Costco for that last roll of toilet paper.
The madness over the coronavirus is not limited to politicians and the medical community.
The head of the neoconservative Atlantic Council wrote an editorial this week urging NATO to pass an Article 5 declaration of war against the COVID-19 virus!
Are they going to send in tanks and drones to wipe out these microscopic enemies?
People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus “pandemic” could be a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit – financially or politically – from the ensuing panic.
That is not to say the disease is harmless. Without question people will die from coronavirus. Those in vulnerable categories should take precautions to limit their risk of exposure.
But we have seen this movie before. Government over-hypes a threat as an excuse to grab more of our freedoms. When the “threat” is over, however, they never give us our freedoms back.

 Coronavirus Treatment: Japanese Flu Drug Found Effective,"Favipiravir had produced positive outcomes during clinical trials conducted in Shenzen as well as the COVID-19’s epicenter Wuhan, according to Zhang Xinmin, director of China’s National Center for Biotechnology Development.
“It has a high degree of safety and is clearly effective in treatment,” CNBC mentioned Zhang.
COVID-19 patients treated with the drug developed by a subsidiary of Fujifilm in Shenzen was reported to turn patients negative for Coronavirus within a median of four days, rather than 11 days for those who were not given the drug favipiravir.

Per the data compiled by John Hopkins University, coronavirus has affected over 200,000 individuals globally with over 8,000 deaths.
“The trial also found that X-ray photos confirmed improvements in lung conditions in about 91 percent of the patients who were given the medicine.
“The number stood at 62 percent for those without the drug. The director said the drug is highly safe and its effect is obvious, and formally recommend the use of the medicine as a way to tackle the virus,” mentioned the NHK report.
The report also highlighted the fact that one particular Chinese firm, which has licensed the drug from its Japanese developers, got the government’s approval a month ago in order to mass-produce the medication and help save thousands of people infected with the deadly virus.

 UN Troops Featured in Military World Games in Wuhan China Weeks Before Coronavirus Outbreak,"In this report we take a closer look inside the Military World Games opening ceremony held in Wuhan China weeks before the coronavirus outbreak.
Is it just a coincidence that a UN-themed pandemic simulation of a global coronavirus outbreak took place the same day as the UN-themed opening ceremonies in Wuhan, ground zero for the outbreak?
We also examine which nation will fill the vacuum now that the world’s biggest economy has been crippled by the outbreak.

 Dutch Researchers Find Coronavirus Antibody,"A world premiere for Erasmus MC and Utrecht University. Researchers from the two universities have discovered an antibody against COVID-19.
The scientific paper from the group of ten scientists is now ready for peer reviews from the leading professional journal Nature. The Rotterdam university journal – Erasmus Magazine – first reported the sensational news.
According to one of the people who identified it, the antibody that blocks the infection of SARS1 and SARS2 was already briefly lain in the fridge at the Erasmus MC in Rotterdam. Professor of Cell Biology Frank Grosveld (71) is part of a team of ten scientists.

He posted the article about the discovery to BioRxiv last Thursday. BioRxiv is a website where biologists can publish their research before it has been peer-reviewed by a professional journal.
The summary talks about an antibody against SARS2, the coronavirus that is causing the current pandemic (COVID-19).
The antibody may help detect and prevent this form of Corona infection. This would, therefore, make the active antibody a world premiere.
Very first antibody
The antibody still has to be tested on human beings and this will take a few months. Yet Grosveld is hopeful, according to Erasmus Magazine:
“We are now trying to get a pharmaceutical company on board – that’s looking good, by the way – which can mass-produce the antibody as a medicine on a large scale. This is the very first antibody that we know of that will block the infection.
“And there is a good chance that this will also become a medicine that reaches the market. If this is taken by a patient, then it is expected that the infection can be stopped in that patient. So, the patient will have a chance of recovery.”
In the article, Grosveld has responded critically to the Dutch approach to the Corona pandemic.
“We have been too lax and were ill-prepared. For example, there were too few tests and too few restrictions from the outset, even though we saw what happened in China and then Italy.”

 Coronavirus vs. the Mass Surveillance State: Which Poses the Greater Threat?,"“If, as it seems, we are in the process of becoming a totalitarian society in which the state apparatus is all-powerful, the ethics most important for the survival of the true, free, human individual would be: cheat, lie, evade, fake it, be elsewhere, forge documents, build improved electronic gadgets in your garage that’ll outwit the gadgets used by the authorities.” — Philip K. Dick
Emboldened by the citizenry’s inattention and willingness to tolerate its abuses, the government has weaponized one national crisis after another in order to expands its powers.
The war on terror, the war on drugs, the war on illegal immigration, asset forfeiture schemes, road safety schemes, school safety schemes, eminent domain: all of these programs started out as legitimate responses to pressing concerns and have since become weapons of compliance and control in the police state’s hands.

It doesn’t even matter what the nature of the crisis might be — civil unrest, the national emergencies, “unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters” — as long as it allows the government to justify all manner of government tyranny in the so-called name of national security.
Now we find ourselves on the brink of a possible coronavirus contagion.
I’ll leave the media and the medical community to speculate about the impact the coronavirus will have on the nation’s health, but how will the government’s War on the Coronavirus impact our freedoms?
For a hint of what’s in store, you can look to China — our role model for all things dystopian — where the contagion started.
In an attempt to fight the epidemic, the government has given its surveillance state apparatus — which boasts the most expansive and sophisticated surveillance system in the world — free rein. Thermal scanners using artificial intelligence (AI) have been installed at train stations in major cities to assess body temperatures and identify anyone with a fever.
Facial recognition cameras and cell phone carriers track people’s movements constantly, reporting in real time to data centers that can be accessed by government agents and employers alike. And coded color alerts (red, yellow and green) sort people into health categories that correspond to the amount of freedom of movement they’re allowed: “Green code, travel freely. Red or yellow, report immediately.”
Mind you, prior to the coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese surveillance state had already been hard at work tracking its citizens through the use of some 200 million security cameras installed nationwide. Equipped with facial recognition technology, the cameras allow authorities to track so-called criminal acts, such as jaywalking, which factor into a person’s social credit score.
Social media credit scores assigned to Chinese individuals and businesses categorize them on whether or not they are “good” citizens. A real-name system — which requires people to use government-issued ID cards to buy mobile sims, obtain social media accounts, take a train, board a plane, or even buy groceries — coupled with social media credit scores ensures that those blacklisted as “unworthy” are banned from accessing financial markets, buying real estate or travelling by air or train.
Among the activities that can get you labeled unworthy are taking reserved seats on trains or causing trouble in hospitals.
That same social credit score technology used to identify, track and segregate citizens is now one of China’s chief weapons in its fight to contain the coronavirus from spreading. However, it is far from infallible and a prime example of the difficulties involved in navigating an autonomous system where disembodied AI systems call the shots.
For instance, one woman, who has no symptoms of the virus but was assigned a red code based on a visit to her hometown, has been blocked from returning to her home and job until her color code changes. She has been stuck in this state of limbo for weeks with no means of challenging the color code or knowing exactly why she’s been assigned a red code.
Fighting the coronavirus epidemic has given China the perfect excuse for unleashing the full force of its surveillance and data collection powers. The problem, as Eamon Barrett acknowledges in Fortune magazine, is what happens after: “Once the outbreak is controlled, it’s unclear whether the government will retract its new powers.”
The lesson for the ages: once any government is allowed to expand its powers, it’s almost impossible to pull back.
Meanwhile, here in the U.S., the government thus far has limited its coronavirus preparations to missives advising the public to stay calm, wash their hands, and cover their mouths when they cough and sneeze.
Don’t go underestimating the government’s ability to lock the nation down if the coronavirus turns into a pandemic, however. After all, the government has been planning and preparing for such a crisis for years now.
The building blocks are already in place for such an eventuality: the surveillance networks, fusion centers and government contractors that already share information in real time; the government’s massive biometric databases that can identify individuals based on genetic and biological markers; the militarized police, working in conjunction with federal agencies, ready and able to coordinate with the federal government when it’s time to round up the targeted individuals; the courts that will sanction the government’s methods, no matter how unlawful, as long as it’s done in the name of national security; and the detention facilities, whether private prisons or FEMA internment camps, that have been built and are waiting to be filled.
Now all of this may sound far-fetched to you now, but we’ve already arrived at the dystopian futures prophesied by George Orwell’s 1984, Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, and Philip K. Dick’s Minority Report.
It won’t take much more to push us over the edge into Neill Blomkamp’s Elysium, in which the majority of humanity is relegated to an overpopulated, diseased, warring planet where the government employs technologies such as drones, tasers and biometric scanners to track, target and control the populace.
Mind you, while these technologies are already in use today and being hailed for their potentially life-saving, cost-saving, time-saving benefits, it won’t be long before the drawbacks to having a government equipped with technology that makes it all-seeing, all-knowing, and all-powerful — helped along by the citizenry — far outdistance the benefits.
On a daily basis, Americans are relinquishing (in many cases, voluntarily) the most intimate details of who we are — their biological makeup, our genetic blueprints, and our biometrics (facial characteristics and structure, fingerprints, iris scans, etc.) — in order to navigate an increasingly technologically-enabled world.
Consider all the ways you continue to be tracked, hunted, hounded, and stalked by the government and its dubious agents:
By tapping into your phone lines and cell phone communications, the government knows what you say. By uploading all of your emails, opening your mail, and reading your Facebook posts and text messages, the government knows what you write.
By monitoring your movements with the use of license plate readers, surveillance cameras and other tracking devices, the government knows where you go. By churning through all of the detritus of your life — what you read, where you go, what you say — the government can predict what you will do.
By mapping the synapses in your brain, scientists — and in turn, the government — will soon know what you remember. By mapping your biometrics — your “face-print” — and storing the information in a massive, shared government database available to bureaucratic agencies, police and the military, the government’s goal is to use facial recognition software to identify you (and every other person in the country) and track your movements, wherever you go.
And by accessing your DNA, the government will soon know everything else about you that they don’t already know: your family chart, your ancestry, what you look like, your health history, your inclination to follow orders or chart your own course, etc.
Of course, none of these technologies are foolproof.
Nor are they immune from tampering, hacking or user bias.
Nevertheless, they have become a convenient tool in the hands of government agents to render null and void the Constitution’s requirements of privacy and its prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures.
The ramifications of a government — any government — having this much unregulated, unaccountable power to target, track, round up and detain its citizens is beyond chilling.
Imagine what a totalitarian regime such as Nazi Germany could have done with this kind of unadulterated power.
Imagine what the next police state to follow in Germany’s footsteps will do with this kind of power. Society is rapidly moving in that direction.
We’ve made it so easy for the government to watch us.
Government eyes see your every move: what you read, how much you spend, where you go, with whom you interact, when you wake up in the morning, what you’re watching on television and reading on the internet.
Every move you make is being monitored, mined for data, crunched, and tabulated in order to form a picture of who you are, what makes you tick, and how best to control you when and if it becomes necessary to bring you in line.
Chances are, as the Washington Post has reported, you have already been assigned a color-coded threat assessment score — green, yellow or red — so police are forewarned about your potential inclination to be a troublemaker depending on whether you’ve had a career in the military, posted a comment perceived as threatening on Facebook, suffer from a particular medical condition, or know someone who knows someone who might have committed a crime.
In other words, you’re most likely already flagged in a government database somewhere.
The government has the know-how.
Indeed, for years now, the FBI and Justice Department have conspired to acquire near-limitless power and control over biometric information collected on law-abiding individuals, millions of whom have never been accused of a crime.
Going far beyond the scope of those with criminal backgrounds, the FBI’s Next Generation Identification database (NGID), a billion dollar boondoggle that is aimed at dramatically expanding the government’s ID database from a fingerprint system to a vast data storehouse of iris scans, photos searchable with face recognition technology, palm prints, and measures of gait and voice recordings alongside records of fingerprints, scars, and tattoos.
Launched in 2008, the NGID is a massive biometric database that contains more than 100 million fingerprints and 45 million facial photos gathered from a variety of sources ranging from criminal suspects and convicts to daycare workers and visa applicants, including millions of people who have never committed or even been accused of a crime.
In other words, innocent American citizens are now automatically placed in a suspect database.
For a long time, the government was required to at least observe some basic restrictions on when, where and how it could access someone’s biometrics and DNA and use it against them.
That is no longer the case.
The information is being amassed through a variety of routine procedures, with the police leading the way as prime collectors of biometrics for something as non-threatening as a simple moving violation. The nation’s courts are also doing their part to “build” the database, requiring biometric information as a precursor to more lenient sentences.
And of course Corporate America (including Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.) has made it so easy to use one’s biometrics to access everything from bank accounts to cell phones.
We’ve made it so easy for the government to target, identify and track us.
Add pre-crime programs into the mix with government agencies and corporations working in tandem to determine who is a potential danger and spin a sticky spider-web of threat assessments, behavioral sensing warnings, flagged “words,” and “suspicious” activity reports using automated eyes and ears, social media, behavior sensing software, and citizen spies, and you having the makings for a perfect dystopian nightmare.
This is the kind of oppressive pre-crime and pre-thought crime package foreshadowed by George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and Phillip K. Dick.
Remember, even the most well-intentioned government law or program can be — and has been — perverted, corrupted and used to advance illegitimate purposes once profit and power are added to the equation.
In the right (or wrong) hands, benevolent plans can easily be put to malevolent purposes.
Surveillance, digital stalking and the data mining of the American people add up to a society in which there’s little room for indiscretions, imperfections, or acts of independence.
This is the creepy, calculating yet diabolical genius of the American police state: the very technology we hailed as revolutionary and liberating has become our prison, jailer, probation officer, Big Brother and Father Knows Best all rolled into one.
It turns out that we are Soylent Green.
The 1973 film of the same name, starring Charlton Heston and Edward G. Robinson, is set in 2022 in an overpopulated, polluted, starving New York City whose inhabitants depend on synthetic foods manufactured by the Soylent Corporation for survival.
Heston plays a policeman investigating a murder, who discovers the grisly truth about the primary ingredient in the wafer, soylent green, which is the principal source of nourishment for a starved population.
“It’s people. Soylent Green is made out of people,” declares Heston’s character. “They’re making our food out of people. Next thing they’ll be breeding us like cattle for food.”
Oh, how right he was.
Soylent Green is indeed people or, in our case, Soylent Green is our own personal data, repossessed, repackaged and used by corporations and the government to entrap us.
Without constitutional protections in place to guard against encroachments on our rights when power, technology and militaristic governance converge, it won’t be long before we find ourselves, much like Edward G. Robinson’s character in Soylent Green, looking back on the past with longing, back to an age where we could speak to whom we wanted, buy what we wanted, think what we wanted, and go where we wanted without those thoughts, words and movements being tracked, processed and stored by corporate giants such as Google, sold to government agencies such as the NSA and CIA, and used against us by militarized police with their army of futuristic technologies.
We’re not quite there yet. But that moment of reckoning is getting closer by the minute.
In the meantime, we’ve got an epidemic to survive, so go ahead and wash your hands. Cover your mouth when you cough or sneeze. And stock up on whatever you might need to survive this virus if it spreads to your community.
We are indeed at our most vulnerable right now, but as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, it’s the American Surveillance State — not the coronavirus — that poses the greatest threat to our freedoms.

 US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Calls the COVID-19 Pandemic a ‘Live Exercise’ – Trump Responds ‘You Should Have Let Us Know’,"We are in the midst of a live exercise according to US Secretary of State and former CIA head Mike Pompeo, who only a year ago openly boasted that “we lied, cheat and stole.”
Pompeo admitted on CNN that “we’re in a live exercise here” when referring to COVID-19 during a press conference. This is yet more evidence that the entire coronavirus crisis has been scripted, planned for and orchestrated.
The language that Pompeo used – “live exercise” – is eerily reminiscent of language used in false flag operations when the exercise or drill “went live”, i.e. when the very scenario that the authorities were planning for actually happened (see 9/11, 7/7 and numerous US mass shootings) as they were in the middle of their exercise.

Pompeo Slips Up and Calls the Pandemic a Live Exercise
Here’s the clip. Watch it for yourself. Notice how Trump, who is right by Pompeo’s side, appears to chide his Secretary of State right there and then during the TV performance.
Trump says: “You should have let us know.”
Does this indicate that Trump has not read in until later, reinforcing the idea that presidents and prime ministers don’t really run their countries, but are rather told what the plan is, and that they’d better get on board?

Implications of Pompeo’s Comment
There are already various clues this whole pandemic – really a fake pandemic – was planned in advance. There is the 2010 Rockefeller Foundation paper which talked about it.
There is the Illuminati insider who revealed secret plans to release a bioweapon on the Chinese by saying that “China will catch a cold.”
There is the Bill Gates/ Big Pharma/ CDC Event 201 Simulation. There is possible Chinese Government foreknowledge.
There is the simple fact that this pandemic is allowing the social engineers to simultaneously and rapidly roll out almost every conceivable NWO (New World Order) agenda, including censorship, surveillance, quarantine, martial law, the cashless agenda, governmental emergency powers, the 5G rollout, social isolation as the “new normal“, mandatory vaccinations and the human microchipping agenda.
On top of all of that, now we have Pompeo talking of a live exercise and essentially admitting that this is part of a script.
How much more proof will people require to see through this engineered crisis?

 New York Hospitals Are Treating Coronavirus Patients with High Dosages of VITAMIN C After Promising Results from China,"Doctors throughout New York state are giving their critically ill coronavirus patients massive doses of vitamin C, a tactic said to have helped those hit the hardest in China.
Dr Andrew Weber, a Long Island based pulmonologist and critical-care specialist with Northwell Health, shared that he has been immediately giving his intensive-care patients 1,500 milligrams of intravenous vitamin C [that’s very little compared to China].
Those patients are then re-administered the doses of the powerful antioxidant three or four times a day, the doctor explained to the New York Post.

Weber said the regimen is based on experimental treatments administered to coronavirus patients in Shanghai, China.
‘The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C,’ he said. ‘It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it’s not a sexy drug.’
Jason Molinet, a spokesman for Northwell, said that Vitamin C is being ‘widely used’ as a coronavirus treatment throughout the health system. He noted, however, that the amount given to patients varies.
According to Dr. Richard Cheng, Dr. Mao stated that his group treated about 50 cases of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 infection with high dose IVC. Dosing of IVC ranged from 10,000 mg – 20,000 mg a day for 7-10 days, with 10,000 mg for moderate cases and 20,000 for more severe cases.

 Coronavirus Contains Unique “Gain-of-Function” Property “for Efficient Spreading in the Human Population” — Exact Quote from Science Paper Published in Antiviral Research,"We now have bombshell, smoking gun evidence that the CoVid-19 “Wuhan” coronavirus was specifically engineered as an offensive biological warfare weapon, designed to target to exterminate human beings.
A new study published in the peer-reviewed journal Antiviral Research (Vol. 16, April 2020) is entitled, “The spike glycoprotein of the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV contains a furin-like cleavage site absent in CoV of the same clade.”
It reveals that the CoVid-19 coronavirus contains unique features that allow it to function as a more efficient weapon system for human-to-human transmission, which helps explain why the virus has been impossible to contain (even under “quarantine” conditions, which have universally failed in China, Japan, Korea and elsewhere).

As the science authors of the paper explain in the full text, “This furin-like cleavage site… may provide a gain-of-function to the 2019-nCoV for efficient spreading in the human population.” (Emphasis added)
Bill Gates & World Economic Forum Ran Coronavirus Outbreak Simulation Just 6 Weeks Before The Real Outbreak
Further, the science paper finds that there is no known viral ancestry to the CoVid-19 coronavirus, meaning it did not evolve from nature. It was engineered, and the science paper authors also state that the virus contains elements from MERS, stating, “Before the emergence of the 2019-nCoV, this important feature was not observed in the lineage b of betacoronaviruses.”
The abstract and full PDF (paid) of the study are available through THIS LINK at ScienceDirect.com.

The “smoking gun” aspects of this research were brought to light earlier today by Prof. Frances Boyle who appeared on the Alex Jones Show (2nd broadcast hour, Feb. 19th, 2020) to reveal his findings that confirm the Wuhan coronavirus was an engineered biological weapon.
5+ NWO Agendas Accompanying The Coronavirus Epidemic
Tomorrow we will publish the full transcript from that interview, containing stunning new details about the origin of the viral weapon. You can watch the full 47-minute segment here:

 5+ NWO Agendas Accompanying the Coronavirus Epidemic,"While the coronavirus epidemic continues, with people debating on both sides whether it is being overplayed or underplayed, it is worthwhile pausing to consider what agendas – and I mean which NWO agendas – are being rolled out using the epidemic as a cover or pretext.
As I covered in my last article The Coronavirus – 5G Connection and Coverup, with these kind of outbreaks, there is always a dual motivation for authorities: the motivation to hype and the motivation to downplay because both approaches serve the ruling class in different ways.
Deception is a hallmark of government, and clearly all the more so in an emergency, so it is always going to be hard to trust whatever news or stats are coming from official sources.

Regardless of the virus’ true origins and virulence, we can say for sure that there are several agendas being pushed as you read these words.
It’s the same old Hegelian dialectic strategy of problem-reaction-solution, and whatever the reality is on a microbial level, the world’s population has the perception of a problem, so the ruling class has another opportunity to make their order out of chaos.
Below are 5+ NWO agendas being carried out due to the coronavirus epidemic:
1. Centralized Control of Information, i.e. Censorship and Narrative Control
Quite a few of the speakers at the Event 201 simulation (hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center in partnership with World Economic Forum [WEF] and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) spoke of the need for the centralized control of information during a pandemic, including one speaker Lavan Thiru (described as a Monetary Authority of Singapore) who mentioned “a step up from the part of the government on enforcement actions against fake news.”
There were some who said Big Tech is a no longer a platform but a broadcaster and must be made to combat fake news.
Another speaker in typical fashion demonized conspiracy theories.
Here is a quote directly from the simulation / make-believe event (which came true 6 weeks later):
“Disinformation and misinformation are wreaking havoc … pharmaceutical companies are being accused of introducing the … virus so they can make money on drugs and vaccines, and have seen public faith in their products plummet.
“Unrest due to false rumors and divisive messaging is rising, and is exacerbating spread of the disease as levels of trust fall, and people stop cooperating with response efforts. This is a massive problem, one that threatens governments and trusted institutions.
“National governments are considering or have already implemented a range of interventions to combat misinformation.
“Some governments have taken control of national access to the internet; others are censoring websites and social media content, and a small number have shut down internet access completely to prevent the flow of misinformation. Penalties have been put in place for spreading harmful falsehoods, including arrests.”
The plan is to continue the censorship which Big Tech has been spearheading for years now, using the excuse of harmful “fake news” by claiming that the dissemination of false information during an emergency is a bigger problem than usual and must be stopped.
Here are some other quotes from the event:
“I do think that there needs to be sort-of an honest broker, a centralized command-and-control organization that really brings together the public-private sector, both on a global approach and also on a local approach …”
“Yes, I agree, and I wanted to speak to the point about having the honest broker, and I think in this regard the United Nations fits the bill … “
“It’s important that the UN and WHO remain very clear, but when they challenge governments directly, they often get into this issue of sovereignty, and so I think it’s really important not to have that as the only response … it’s really critical to remember soft power influence …”
That last statement reveals yet again a dominant NWO agenda in so many arenas of life: narrative control.
2. The Cashless Agenda
The cashless agenda is a long-term NWO scheme that goes hand in hand with transhumanism, i.e. the digitization of everything in society, including things like money, information and life itself.
Power-hungry control freaks – the types of people that gravitate towards government – love the idea of a cashless society because then every single economic transaction can be traced, which allows authorities to build an even more complete picture of who you are so as stop any possible disobedience or revolution before it happens. It also increases governmental revenue via taxation.
As this Activist Post article highlights, China has jumped on the opportunity to forward the cashless agenda by claiming that paper money must now be taken out of circulation due to the possibility that it could contain traces of COVID-19 and therefore contribute to the spreading of the coronavirus.
3. Martial Law Quarantines
Governments love martial law scenarios, because normal human rights are suspended. Authoritarian China has been lauded by many globalists such as the late David Rockefeller as a model for the New World Order.
Some of the photos and videos coming out of China showing the police state there have been horrific.
Another crisis, another opportunity for the government to see how much they can get away with under the banner of fighting the virus.
4. Mandatory Vaccination
The coronavirus epidemic has provided a good excuse for governments round the world to introduce one of their favorite NWO agendas – mandatory vaccination.
The reason why this agenda is particularly so well liked is that it allows authorities access to the human body – and not just the citizen’s body, but his or her bloodstream too.
Truthfully, we have no idea what is in that needle when it gets injected, so all sorts of things could be implanted in our bodies without our knowledge or consent.
Coincidentally (or not), China passed a law on June 29th 2019 that rolled out a national mandatory vaccination program.
Coincidentally (or not), the law went into effect on December 1st 2019, just weeks before the coronavirus epidemic became a worldwide news story. Here is the article:
“On June 29, 2019, the National People’s Congress Standing Committee of the People’s Republic of China (PRC or China) adopted the PRC Law on Vaccine Administration (Vaccine Law). The official Xinhua news agency states that the Law provides for the “strictest” vaccine management with tough penalties in order to ensure the country’s vaccine safety …
“The Law mandates the launching of a national vaccine electronic tracking platform that integrates tracking information throughout the whole process of vaccine production, distribution, and use to ensure all vaccine products can be tracked and verified (art. 10).
“According to the Law, China is to implement a state immunization program, and residents living within the territory of China are legally obligated to be vaccinated with immunization program vaccines, which are provided by the government free of charge.
“Local governments and parents or other guardians of children must ensure that children be vaccinated with the immunization program vaccines … The Law will take effect on December 1, 2019.”
I also have to wonder about the implications when we have so-called experts like Ralph Baric who are pointing out that this coronavirus epidemic may include asymptomatic carriers (as in this story of the 10-year-old Chinese boy who had no symptoms but allegedly tested positive for COVID-19).
This may be helpful information, but it also adds fuel to the mandatory vaccine fire so to speak, because then the authorities claim that they have to vaccinate everyone to protect society due to all these possible hidden asymptomatic carriers that could pop up and infect everyone.
By extension, mandatory vaccination may also include DNA vaccines and microchipping (see next).
5. Bill Gates’ ID2020: Digital Identification via Microchipping
As David Icke says, if Bill Gates is involved in it, it’s bad for humanity. 
NWO point-man Gates has been heavily pushing GMOs and vaccines for years (including slipping up and admitting that vaccines contribute to population control); he was part of Event 201 that simulated the coronavirus epidemic before it happened; he “didn’t have any business relationship or friendship with” Jeffrey Epstein; so now we have to ask how else this sold-out NWO frontman is benefiting from the virus. Turns out the answer may be found in yet another globalist project Gates has been promoting: ID 2020.
This is the human microchipping agenda, repackaged. It sells itself as “a trusted and reliable way” to fulfill a “fundamental and universal human right” – safeguarding your identity both online and in the physical world. This article reports:
“The ID2020 Alliance, as it’s being called, is a digital identity program that aims to “leverage immunization” as a means of inserting tiny microchips into people’s bodies.
“In collaboration with the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, also known as GAVI, the government of Bangladesh and various other “partners in government, academia, and humanitarian relief,” the ID2020 Alliance … wants all humans to be “vaccinated” with digital tracking chips that will create a seamless monitoring system for the New World Order to manage the populations of the world with ease.“
“While the ID2020 program’s testing grounds are primarily in the Third World, the group says it’s also now working with governments here in the United States to start microchipping people through vaccination.
“In Austin, Texas, for example, the homeless population is now being exploited as a collective guinea pig for ID2020’s microchip vaccination program, which the group claims will help to “empower” homeless people by supposedly giving them “control” over their personal identity data.
“The City of Austin, ID2020, and several other partners are working together with homeless people and the service providers who engage with them to develop a blockchain-enabled digital identity platform called MyPass to empower homeless people with their own identity data,” writes Chris Burt for BiometricUpdate.com.​
“ID2020 is also jabbing refugees with its microchip vaccinations through two inaugural pilot programs known as iRespond and Everest.”
Since Gates was obviously intimately involved in planning this outbreak and ensuring his companies have the patents and vaccines for the newly released virus, is he also planning on using the coronavirus epidemic to further promote ID2020?
6. Agenda 2030: Wuhan Slated to be one of China’s Smart Cities
A massive agenda involved in the coronavirus epidemic is the agenda of all agenda – UN Agenda 2030, which involves Smart Cities. Guess what? Before the outbreak China had already planned which of its cities were going to be the ones slated to become the pilot Smart Cities.
Wuhan was one of them (which makes sense why it was also the site of China’s 5G rollout as covered in my previous article). See here:
“Wuhan Future City, located in eastern East Lake High-Tech Development Zone, is one of the four concentrated talent bases for major State-owned enterprises and the only “future science and technology town” approved by the State Council for central and western regions.”
7. Is the Coronavirus Epidemic a Race-Based Bioweapon?
I don’t know if I would exactly classify this as a NWO agenda, but a race-based bioweapon is certainly a likely possibility here. Consider that virtually all known deaths from the coronavirus epidemic thus far have been in China.
Only around 4 deaths outside of China have been reported – 1 in the Philippines on February 1st, 1 in Japan on February 13th and 2 in Iran on February 20th. Lance Walton (VDare.com) has written several articles asking why no one is talking about it.
He points out how WHO (World Health Organization) Director-General Tedros Ahanom Ghebreyesus declared that he opposed travel bans.
ZeroHedge.com quoted him as saying that “We reiterate our call to all countries not to impose restrictions that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade. Such restrictions can have the effect of increasing fear and stigma, with little public health benefit.”
If the virus doesn’t discriminate based on race, and just weakens or kills anyone, then the public health benefits of banning people would be great.
However, if the virus does indeed discriminate on race, and only targets East Asians, then the WHO head’s comments make sense.
This raises yet more questions: if the COVID-19 is a race-based bioweapon, who created it? The US? Israel? How did they sneak it into China and release it?
Conclusion: Coronavirus Epidemic Being Used to Push NWO Agendas
Interestingly, the opening ceremony of the Wuhan Military Games declared a “New World” (see image of a screenshot from the opening ceremony) which suggests the phrase New World Order and also suggests societal transformation – yet another clue that this entire event was pre-planned:
A screenshot of the opening ceremony of the Wuhan Military Games proclaiming a New World
Whatever the truth turns out to be about the origin of the virus itself, who created it, how it was released and whether it is really as dangerous as is hyped, there can be no doubt that the entire coronavirus epidemic phenomenon is being used to accelerate several NWO agendas in typical problem-reaction-solution style.

 Denmark Passes Law Enabling Forced Coronavirus Vaccinations,"Denmark has passed an emergency law that allows for the government to force people to take a vaccine for coronavirus.
The emergency law gives authorities sweeping powers to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain in force until March 2021.
Citizens who refuse to be tested for the coronavirus will face fines and potential prison time, and will be prevented from entering shops, grocery stores, public institutions and hospitals while also being restricted from using public transport.

“As well as enforcing quarantine measures, the law also allows the authorities to force people to be vaccinated, even though there is currently no vaccination for the virus,” reports the Local.
Copenhagen University law professor Jens Elo Rytter said the new measures were “certainly the most extreme since the Second World War.”
The initial draft of the law was even more draconian, and would have allowed police to enter private homes without a warrant if there was a suspicion of a coronavirus infection.
However, this measure was dropped after opposition from other parties in the Parliament.
Denmark currently has 875 recorded coronavirus cases and has registered 2 deaths.

 “Martial Law” Being Seen In U.S. and Europe Over COVID-19 Is The Bigger Threat,"NYC’s governor Andrew Cuomo wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times begging President U.S. Donald Trump to enact martial law.
Meanwhile, other states have already taken shocking martial law measures without an official declaration, showing our potential unconstitutional future under fears of the coronavirus that likely won’t go away after the pandemic has subsided.
All over the U.S. there seems be this new trend — military and police now acting as if we are under martial law without a formal declaration of such.

Yet, here we have NYC’s governor Cuomo begging Trump to essentially declare martial law by utilizing the military for the COVID-19 pandemic and federalize shutdowns.
“Slowing the spread of coronavirus is a function of testing and reducing the density of public gatherings.
“So first, Mr. President, you must stop the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from overregulating the testing process, and authorize states to certify a wider array of testing labs and methods,” Cuomo writes.
Cuomo goes on to express that Trump should utilize the Army Corps of Engineers to transform existing facilities into temporary medical centers.
States cannot build more hospitals, acquire ventilators or modify facilities quickly enough.
At this point, our best hope is to utilize the Army Corps of Engineers to leverage its expertise, equipment and people power to retrofit and equip existing facilities — like military bases or college dormitories — to serve as temporary medical centers.
Then we can designate existing hospital beds for the acutely ill.
To sum up what Trump can do to defend against the spread of the coronavirus Cuomo writes,
“In short: Localize testing, federalize shutdowns and task the Army Corps of Engineers to expand hospital capacity.”
While building hospital beds in existing facilities and using the military to do so isn’t a bad idea, forced quarantines would be expanding the police state.
NYC hasn’t yet gone into “martial law mode,” but other states have basically enacted it in the form of the National Guard being deployed in heavily infected areas.
According to reports, the National Guard has been deployed so far to six states with many more expected to follow.
Beyond that, there are reports that Kentucky has a patient who refused to self isolate.
As a result, the state took things into their own hands by suspending his rights and police are now guarding him armed 24/7 at his house.
If that’s not enough, there was a video posted online of New Orleans’ police in several cop cars demanding citizens leave the streets and disperse immediately.

Then there is the curfew in New Jersey for residents and forced closure of restaurants and certain stores in other states like — California, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington, with more following suit.
“Effective tonight, all other non-essential retail, recreational, and entertainment businesses MUST CLOSE after 8:00 PM,” said Murphy.
“All non-essential and non-emergency travel in New Jersey is strongly discouraged between the hours of 8:00 PM and 5:00 AM This will remain in effect for the foreseeable future. We want everyone to be home –- and not out,” he added.
What’s more is the U.S. isn’t the only one.
The UK and Italy have declared a nationwide lockdown; in other words, imposing martial law on its citizens, as well as France which followed suit, deploying 100,000 police to enforce a national quarantine in the country.
As this pandemic continues to spread we can expect more quarantines and police state actions across the world in other countries.
Back in the U.S. gun sales are skyrocketing in several states as fear of uncertainty from the virus and stock market collapse takes over American citizens seeking protection in the form of arming themselves, as LA Times reported.
Yes, everywhere you look the police state is increasing all in the name of the coronavirus, arguably one of the world’s most infectious diseases in history.
Still, these measures being put into place now will likely remain long after the pandemic has stopped and the virus has run its course. That’s the everlasting effect that COVID-19 will have on our society.
The coronavirus is now classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and it may very well be a legitimate health concern for all of us around the world. But it’s the government’s response that should worry us all more in the long run.

 Environmentalist Group: “Corona is the Cure – Humans are the Disease”,"A climate change group that aligns itself with Extinction Rebellion posted stickers claiming that coronavirus is a “cure” for the “disease” that is humanity.
“Earth is healing. The air and water is clearing,” tweeted Extinction Rebellion East Midlands. “Corona is the cure. Humans are the disease!”
The post shows stickers with the same message and the Extinction Rebellion logo plastered on lamp posts.

When another branch of Extinction Rebellion challenged that this “does not follows XR’s principles,” the East Midlands chapter doubled down.
“We are pointing out that from the perspective of the Earth, humans behave like a disease. The idea is not to be,” they responded.
While Extinction Rebellion East Midlands may represent little more than the ravings of one idiot, the notion that humanity somehow deserved coronavirus and that it’s good for the planet has been widely shared by environmentalists and celebrities.
After actor Idris Elba tested positive for coronavirus, he claimed that COVID-19 was the planet “reacting to the human race” as revenge for climate change.
Despite numerous claims that nature is ‘flourishing’ and animals are thriving thanks to coronavirus, it turns out that most of those stories are fake news.

 New Vaccines Will Permanently Alter Your DNA,"I repost this story now because, in the rush to develop a vaccine against the China coronavirus in the next 90 days, public health officials are mentioning several experimental technologies—never before released openly for public use.
One of those technologies is: DNA insertion.
The reference is the New York Times, 3/10/15, “Protection Without a Vaccine.” It describes the frontier of research. Here are key quotes that illustrate the use of synthetic genes to “protect against disease,” while changing the genetic makeup of humans. This is not science fiction:

“By delivering synthetic genes into the muscles of the [experimental] monkeys, the scientists are essentially re-engineering the animals to resist disease.”
“’The sky’s the limit,’ said Michael Farzan, an immunologist at Scripps and lead author of the new study.”
“The first human trial based on this strategy — called immunoprophylaxis by gene transfer, or I.G.T. — is underway, and several new ones are planned.” [That was nearly five years ago.]
“I.G.T. is altogether different from traditional vaccination. It is instead a form of gene therapy. Scientists isolate the genes that produce powerful antibodies against certain diseases and then synthesize artificial versions. The genes are placed into viruses and injected into human tissue, usually muscle.”
Here is the punchline: “The viruses invade human cells with their DNA payloads, and the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient’s own DNA. If all goes well, the new genes instruct the cells to begin manufacturing powerful antibodies.”
Read that again: “the synthetic gene is incorporated into the recipient’s own DNA.”
Alteration of the human genetic makeup.
Not just a “visit.” Permanent residence.
The Times article taps Dr. David Baltimore for an opinion:
“Still, Dr. Baltimore says that he envisions that some people might be leery of a vaccination strategy that means altering their own DNA, even if it prevents a potentially fatal disease.”
Yes, some people might be leery. If they have two or three working brain cells.
This is genetic roulette with a loaded gun.
And the further implications are clear. Vaccines can be used as a cover for the injections of any and all genes, whose actual purpose is unannounced.
The emergence of this Frankenstein technology is paralleled by a shrill push to mandate vaccines, across the board, for both children and adults. The pressure and propaganda are planet-wide.
The freedom and the right to refuse vaccines has always been vital. It is more vital than ever now.
What does wall to wall propaganda about an “ominous epidemic” achieve? You have one answer. If it doesn’t immediately pop into your head, read this article again.

 Creator Of BioWeapons Act Says Coronavirus Is Biological Warfare Weapon,"In an explosive interview Dr. Francis Boyle, who drafted the Biological Weapons Act has given a detailed statement admitting that the 2019 Wuhan Coronavirus is an offensive Biological Warfare Weapon and that the World Health Organization (WHO) already knows about it.
Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, that was approved unanimously by both Houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.

In an exclusive interview given to Geopolitics and Empire, Dr. Boyle discusses the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China and the Biosafety Level 4 laboratory (BSL-4) from which he believes the infectious disease escaped.
He believes the virus is potentially lethal and an offensive biological warfare weapon or dual-use biowarfare weapons agent genetically modified with gain of function properties, which is why the Chinese government originally tried to cover it up and is now taking drastic measures to contain it.
The Wuhan BSL-4 lab is also a specially designated World Health Organization (WHO) research lab and Dr. Boyle contends that the WHO knows full well what is occurring.
Dr. Boyle also touches upon GreatGameIndia‘s exclusive report Coronavirus Bioweapon – where we reported in detail how Chinese Biowarfare agents working at the Canadian lab in Winnipeg were involved in the smuggling of Coronavirus to Wuhan’s lab from where it is believed to have been leaked.
Watch Dr. Francis Boyle’s interview with Geopolitics and Empire below:

Dr. Boyle’s position is in stark contrast to the mainstream media’s narrative of the virus being originated from the seafood market, which is increasingly being questioned by many experts.
Study demonstrated that of the original 40 cases, 14 of them had no contact with the seafood market, including Patient Zero
 
Recently, American Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas also dismantled the mainstream media’s claim on Thursday that pinned the coronavirus outbreak on a market selling dead and live animals.
In a video accompanying his post, Cotton explained that the Wuhan wet market (which Cotton incorrectly referred to as a seafood market) has been shown by experts to not be the source of the deadly contagion.
Cotton referenced a Lancet study which showed that many of the first cases of the novel coronavirus, including patient zero, had no connection to the wet market — devastatingly undermining mainstream media’s claim.
“As one epidemiologist said: ‘That virus went into the seafood market before it came out of the seafood market.’ We still don’t know where it originated,” Cotton said.
“I would note that Wuhan also has China’s only bio-safety level four super laboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.”

 MIT Scientist Claims Coronavirus is a “Deep State Fraud”,"MIT scientist Shiva Ayyadurai claims that coronavirus “fear mongering” is a “Deep State fraud” to manipulate financial markets.
Ayyadurai, who is noted for his controversial claim to be the “inventor of email,” has a PhD in Biological Engineering and is running as a Republican in the 2020 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts.
Responding to President Donald Trump’s claim that Democrats and the media are responsible for inflaming the coronavirus scare “far beyond what the facts would warrant,” Ayyadurai agreed that the panic was being overblown for political and economic reasons.

“As an MIT PhD in Biological Engineering who studies & does research nearly every day on the Immune System, the #coronavirus fear mongering by the Deep State will go down in history as one of the biggest fraud to manipulate economies, suppress dissent, & push MANDATED Medicine!” tweeted Ayyadurai.

Watch: Wuhan Residents Shouting “It’s All Fake” From Their Apartment Windows During Official Visit
Indeed, no matter the true scale of the crisis, there’s little doubt that Democrats have seized upon it to blame Trump for the recent stock market crash almost the point of cheering on the chaos.
While Trump has been blasted for leaving the United States ill-prepared to deal with a potential pandemic, with just 5,000 people in the U.S. being tested for the virus, others have asserted that the crisis has been hijacked by Trump’s political adversaries to blame him unfairly.
Whether one treats the outbreak as a significant threat to the world or an over-hyped hysteria does appear to break down along partisan lines.
A Reuters / Ipsos poll released last week found that Democrats are twice as likely as Republicans to say that the virus poses an imminent threat to the U.S.
Some have pointed to numbers out of South Korea and Singapore which show those countries have the situation under control, with new cases now on the decline.
China has also declared victory over the virus, with Chinese President Xi Jinping saying the “tide has turned,” a sentiment shared by Alfred Wu, associate professor at the National University of Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, who asserted that the “outbreak has basically ended in China.”

 “Millions Could Die” — Bill Gates Warned In 2018 That The World Needs To Prepare For Pandemics Like War,"Should a deadly pandemic comparable to the 1918 influenza outbreak reach the US in the relatively near future, the US government would be powerless to stop it. And in all likelihood, hundreds of thousands — if not, millions — of Americans will die.
That was the message Microsoft founder Bill Gates sent to the world before the Massachusetts Medical Society in April 2018.
If a highly contagious and lethal airborne pathogen like the 1918 influenza were to take hold today, nearly 33 million people worldwide would die in just six months, Gates noted in his prepared remarks, citing a simulation done by the Institute for Disease Modeling, a research organization in Bellevue, Wash.

Specifically, Gates said the U.S. government is falling short in preparing the nation and the world for the “significant probability of a large and lethal modern-day pandemic occurring in our lifetimes.”
Gates discussed his efforts to convince the Trump administration to set aside more funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to prioritize the creation of a national response plan that would govern how resources are deployed during a pandemic or biological weapons attack.
“So we need to invest in other approaches, like antiviral drugs and antibody therapies that can be stockpiled or rapidly manufactured to stop the spread of pandemic diseases or treat people who have been exposed,” he said in his speech.
Gates said he believed “the world needs to prepare for pandemics in the same serious way it prepares for war.” He added,
“This preparation includes staging simulations, war games, and preparedness exercises so that we can better understand how diseases will spread and how to deal with responses such as quarantine and communications to minimize panic,” Gates said.
That was not the first time the billionaire had warned the world.
At the 2017 Munich Security Conference, Gates asked world leaders to “imagine that somewhere in the world a new weapon exists or could emerge that is capable of killing millions of people, bringing economies to a standstill, and casting nations into chaos. If it were a military weapon, the response would be to do everything possible to develop countermeasures,” he said at the NEJM event, adding that a “sense of urgency is lacking” when it comes to biologic threats.
This should concern everyone said Gates, “because history has taught us there will be another deadly global pandemic.
“We can’t predict when, but given the continual emergence of new pathogens, the increasing risk of a bioterror attack, and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal modern-day pandemic will occur in our lifetime,” Gates said.
Furthermore, as SHTFplan.com’s Mac Slavo notes, last October, Gates was involved in Event 201 when a then-imaginary and deadly virus spread around the globe killing 65 million people.
The fictional coronavirus at the center of the Event 201 simulation — a collaboration between the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation — was called CAPS, and it started with pigs in Brazil before spreading to farmers, not unlike how 2019-nCoV reportedly began with animals before spreading to people.
In the simulation, CAPS infected people all across the globe within six months, and by the 18-month mark, it had killed 65 million people and triggered a global financial crisis. – Futurism
The ruling classes were unable to stop it too and with the WHO finally admitting the coronavirus is a global pandemic, the slippery slope towards that simulation’s results are accelerating.
“The Ebola epidemic in West Africa four years ago was another wake-up call, as the number of confirmed cases climbed, the death toll mounted, and local health systems collapsed. Again, the world was much too slow to respond,” Gates said of the 2014-2016 epidemic, which killed 11,000 and infected more than 28,000.
Eleven people were treated for Ebola in the United States during that epidemic, according to the CDC. Gates also compared future deadly global pandemics to a new type of “military weapon.”
As Mac Slavo so poignantly concludes, Gates — like many others — is relying on the ruling class (our masters) to prepare and keep us safe. Gates said “world leaders” need to invest in approaches such as antiviral drugs and antibody therapies that can be stockpiled or rapidly manufactured to the spread of these future diseases. We think you should prepare on your own outside of what the rulers are doing.
If we have learned anything from studying history, it’s that the ruling class cares only about the expansion of their own wealth and power and not the people they are enslaving.
While Gates’s sense of urgency at the time was admirable — and perhaps prophetic given the current status of the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, other experts on the likelihood of a global pandemic emerging in the relatively near future make Gates look like a Walt Disney-level optimist.
“We know that it is coming, but we have no way of stopping it,” said WHO infectious disease specialist Dr. Sylvie Brand.
We warned at the time that “if you haven’t already, now would probably be as good a time as any to invest in some surgical masks.” Sadly, now it is too late and the world is ‘out’ of masks.
You can purchase a set of 50 medical masks here. — Wear each mask once, and do not bring it inside the house after wearing it outside. Wash your clothes after wearing them outside. Wash your hands and face thoroughly with soap (disinfectant does not replace soap).

 How A Viral Pandemic Benefits The Globalist Agenda,"The world today suffers from highly fragile economic and geopolitical conditions.
This is not news to most people in the liberty movement that have been tracking the downward spiral for years, but it is news to a majority of average Americans who rarely venture to get in-depth information on any issue.
The fact of the matter is, even though there are millions of us who are aware of the danger, we are still in a minority.
This creates a serious set of frustrations. When the common citizen is oblivious to the existence of a threat, trying to explain to them the source of that threat becomes a waste of time.
How can they see the root of the problem if they don’t even know the problem is there?

Yes, the world is on the verge of a violent sea-change, but this is not the most important issue.
The most important issue is that this precarious situation is not the product of random chance, simple greed, base human frailty or an “overly complex” system as mainstream experts will predictably claim; it is a deliberately engineered chaos box designed to serve the interests of a select few.
The globalist agenda is complicated in design but simple in its goals: Order out of chaos. Create or exploit every crisis to manipulate the public into consenting. But consent for what?
As Richard N. Gardner, former deputy assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations under Kennedy and Johnson, and a member of the Trilateral Commission, wrote in the April, 1974 issue of the Council on Foreign Relation’s (CFR) journal Foreign Affairs (pg. 558) in an article titled ‘The Hard Road To World Order‘:
“In short, the ‘house of world order’ will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down. It will look like a great ‘booming, buzzing confusion,’ to use William James’ famous description of reality, but an end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault.”
Global pandemic, whether a natural event or deliberately engineered, actually serves the purposes of the globalist establishment in a number of ways. First and foremost, it is a superb distraction.
The general public, overcome with fears of an invisible force of nature that can possibly kill them at any moment, will probably forget all about the much bigger threat to their life, liberty and future – the subsequent collapse of the massive ‘Everything Bubble’ and the globalist “solution” that a pandemic can trigger.
The coronavirus is only a moderate threat in comparison to economic crisis. That said, I want to confront a few issues concerning the virus itself before we get to the economic question.
Virus Disinformation
I have seen a lot of delusional assumptions and outright disinformation being spread by people in regards to this potential pandemic.
First, the notion that it was caused by Chinese citizens “eating bats” or being exposed to a live animal market is rather ridiculous.
We’ve seen NO hard evidence whatsoever that this is true, and I believe the narrative is a cover for the fact that the city of Wuhan where the virus outbreak began is the home of not one but TWO level 4 biohazard labs.
I have a hard time ignoring the strange “coincidence” of the high level biohazard labs in Wuhan in favor of the idea that the virus was launched by chance due to the odd diets of central Chinese people.
Given the evidence it appears that the coronavirus was gestated in a lab, not in someone’s bat and snake soup. In 2017, scientists outside of China warned that these labs were not secure and that a virus might escape one of the facilities.
I would use the term “escape” loosely, as there is a possibility that this event was created intentionally.
The virus itself has certain hallmarks of being engineered (including its long dormant period without visible symptoms) and the current strain is probably derived from the one the Chinese stole a year ago from a lab in Winnipeg, Canada.
But it gets even weirder.
Only three months ago, John Hopkins, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum (a hive of self-professed globalists) ran a “pandemic simulation” called “Event 201” specifically focused on Coronavirus.
Not Ebola, or Swine Flu or even Avian Flu – but CORONAVIRUS. The simulation features the spread of coronavirus in South America, blamed on animal to human transmission (pigs).
The conclusion of the exercise was that national governments were nowhere near ready, scoring 40 out of 100 on their preparedness scale. The simulation projected over 65 million deaths worldwide.
Event 201 played out almost exactly as it has been in China today.

Some very disingenuous or perhaps rather stupid people have been arguing that this kind of thing is “normal”, claiming that we are “lucky” that the elites have been running simulations in advance in order to “save us” from a coronavirus outbreak.
I assert that Event 201 was not a simulation but a war-game to study the possible outcomes of an event the globalists already knew was coming.
Set aside the fact that before almost every major crisis event and terrorist attack for the past few decades authorities were running simulations for that exact event right before it happened; does anyone really believe that Event 201 is pure coincidence?
Another false assumption that needs to be addressed is the idea that a viral threat will not strike the West, or at least, not the US.
This odd bias is one that I don’t think most cultures except Americans suffer from; the belief that they are untouchable and that the system will always avert crisis.
From the responses I have been seeing lately many Americans are living in a fantasy world.
Even now, the investment world is placing full stock and hope in the prediction that the Federal Reserve will step in to disrupt any economic downturn related to the pandemic.
Even if the Fed intended to intervene, why would anyone be naive enough to believe the central bank can do anything about how a viral outbreak damages the economy?
Central banks can do nothing but create debt, and debt will not beat back the coronavirus.
In terms of delusional optimism on the pandemic itself, the arguments range from “screening of travellers is too comprehensive to allow the virus to spread here” and “as long as the virus destroys China, who cares…?” This is a narrow view of the situation.
The screening process is terrible, and usually involves basic questions which can be evaded with lies. But beyond that, the virus is already here.
It was circulating through China for at least a few weeks before it was ever addressed by government authorities or the CDC. It also is reported to be asymptomatic, which means it remains dormant, yet also contagious, for up to two weeks before symptoms become visible.
This is a far worse scenario than the ebola scare in 2014, in that the coronavirus is able to hide effectively.
The only thing that can be done to slow the spread is to shut down ALL international travel, which the CDC and the WHO have no intention of doing right now, not that it matters anymore with over 110 suspected cases in the US already.
So, let’s be realistic. If the virus is as communicable as the CDC and independent scientists claim, then we will see the effects here in America.
Never Let A Good Crisis Go To Waste…
But what do globalists have to gain directly from a coronavirus pandemic beyond simple chaos that can be exploited?
Interestingly, a representative from Johnson and Johnson, one of the companies that may end up designing a “vaccine” for the Cronavirus, suggested during Event 201 that a “centralized” global economic authority in charge of funding and procuring vaccines for various nations in crisis was an option for solving the pandemic.
Gee, that sounds strangely similar to what globalists have been demanding for many years now, and the pandemic just happens to offer a perfect excuse for the creation of such a one-world financial authority.
They might claim that such a system would be temporary according to the life of the pandemic, but this will be a lie.
In terms of the economic effects, even if the virus were to stay primarily in China, the Chinese economy is, in basic terms, the largest in the world; it is the biggest exporter/importer and it is central to the now interdependent global economy.
If China’s economy goes down, even for a short time, this will send shockwaves through all other national economies and supply lines.
In May of last year I published an article titled ‘Globalists Only Need One More Major Event To Finish Sabotaging The Economy‘.
To summarize the situation:
The globalist establishment has created the largest financial bubble in modern history through central bank stimulus, inflating a highly unstable artificial rally in markets while also creating new highs in national debt, corporate debt and consumer debt.
The economic fundamentals have been sending alarms for the past two years, and the ‘Everything Bubble’ is showing signs of implosion. It is only a matter of time before the farce collapses by itself.
The globalists need scapegoats, but they also need an event or wave of events so distracting that people will not be able to discern what really happened.
The reason why globalists want a collapse is simple – They need crisis in order to manipulate the masses into accepting total centralization, a global monetary system and global governance.
They are also rabid believers in eugenics and population reduction.
At the very least, a global pandemic is a useful happenstance for them; but the timing of the coronavirus event and their highly accurate “simulation” only three months ago also suggests their potential involvement, as it comes right as the implosion of the Everything Bubble was accelerating.
Consider this: Even if a pandemic does not kill a large number of people, it still disrupts international travel, it disrupts exports and imports, it disrupts consumer behavior and retail sales, and it disrupts domestic trade.
If it does kill a large number of people, and if the Chinese government’s response is any indication, it could result in global martial law.
With many economies including the US economy already in a precarious balancing act of historic debt vs. crashing demand and useless central bank repo market intervention, there is little chance that the system can withstand such a tsunami.
Make no mistake, the crash has already begun, whether the virus hits the US hard or not. The only question is, will this be the trigger event that accelerates the collapse process that is already in motion?
I took my time in publishing this article because I believed it was important to first watch the Chinese, CDC and WHO response to the virus. If they dealt with the situation quickly then there was a chance that it would have only minor influence on the financial system.
They did not deal with the situation quickly or decisively. In fact, over 5 million people left the Hubei region of China before active quarantine and treatment procedures began.
The situation has spiraled out of control in China and it is clear that the government is now lying through its teeth about the number of sick and dead.
I would not be surprised if we discover in the next two weeks that the death tally is in the thousands, and the sickness rate is actually in the hundreds of thousands.
The fact that China has now quarantined over 50 million people in 16 cities suggests the danger is much higher than they have admitted. If this is the case, then at the very least, the Chinese economy is about to take a massive hit. If the virus doesn’t spread, the economic damage will.
Pandemic Smokescreen, Economic Collapse And “Climate Change”
Look at it this way – The US and China are still currently in the middle of a trade war. The Phase 1 deal was always a joke, because it demands that China quadruple its purchases from the US within the next 1-2 years.
This was never going to happen, but the false hope (along with corporate stock buybacks) lifted global stocks out of reversal.
Now, there is no chance that China will meet the requirements of the Phase 1 deal and that will soon become evident, as China’s economy will grind down under the weight of the pandemic.
If Trump continues tariffs against a nation in the state of a viral emergency he will look like a monster (which I believe is his job as a globalist puppet pretending to be a conservative nationalist).
In the meantime, global trade becomes muddled and the last structural supports of the system snap in half.
With global supply lines frozen and travel eventually restricted, trade will stall. There is no way around this. This is not just about China, it is about all nations.
And, ultimately, this is not even about the coronavirus, it is about the financial time bomb that the globalist establishment created.
It is about our economic interdependency and the house of cards we have become.
In the wake of calamity, the globalists will call for even MORE interdependency. They will claim tragedy struck because we were not “centralized enough”.
Another advantage of the viral crisis is that the establishment will undoubtedly blame the “climate change” and “global warming” hoax for its impetus.
Even though there is absolutely no concrete evidence linking human carbon emissions to climate change or viral outbreaks, given enough public fear globalists will attempt to link the three things together as if it is a proven fact.
Not only will they have a rationale for an economic collapse THEY created, but they can also present a virus engineered by humans in a lab as an “act of nature”, and use it as a rationale for implementing carbon controls
In the next issue of my Wild Bunch Dispatch Newsletter I will be outlining solutions and preparedness options for surviving a pandemic scenario; all is not lost if this event does accelerate as the globalists predicted in their Event 201 model.
It is still hard to say with certainty, but this appears to be the “black swan” that the globalists were waiting for (or planning) all along.
Remaining vigilant in terms of the pandemic is recommended, but do not forget about the economic disaster that will inevitably follow as the coronavirus continues to spread.

 Bill Gates Warns “10 Million Lives” At Risk As Virus Spreads To Africa And Taiwan,"Summary:
• Taiwan reports 1st coronavirus death • Taiwan taxi driver who died from virus carried passengers from mainland, Hong Kong, Macau • Singapore reports 3 more cases • Indonesia says 6 passengers from Westerdam cruise ship tested negative • There are now at least 68,500 cases worldwide, and at least 1,665 deaths from the Covid-19 virus • Japan found 70 more cases aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship • Second African confirms suspected coronavirus case • Hubei province, the outbreak’s epicenter, reported fewer new infections for the second day • Bill Gates warns “10 million deaths” possible in Africa • China’s facemask shortage likely won’t be over anytime soon • WHO says Beijing’s actions bought the world time, but “we don’t know how much time”

Update (1140ET): It’s almost Monday in China. Here’s a smattering of updates from the region as the number of confirmed cases ex-China is starting to go exponential.
If these cases continue accelerating, it will soon become impossible for the Chinese government to continue rigging their data.
First, Malaysia reports that six passengers who have been quarantined since arriving in the country from Cambodia after disembarking from the Westerdam cruise ship have tested negative for the virus.
Yesterday, we reported that an 83-year-old American woman tested positive for the virus after flying to Kuala Lumpur.
As we noted earlier, the Taiwanese man who succumbed to the virus was a taxi driver who apparently carried three fares all returning from China, Hong Kong and Macau. The three fares are being tracked very closely by the government in Taiwan. The man also had a history of diabetes and hep B.
Singapore’s ministry of health reported three new cases, two of which appear to be linked to a cluster of cases at the Grace Assembly of God church, Bloomberg reports.
Following reports that one of Wuhan’s hastily constructed hospitals is already falling down, a hospital head in the city appeared on state television to insist that a “turning point has been reached” in the government’s fight to suppress the virus.
‘Experts’ speaking to Xinhua on Sunday parroted the message from the regime and insisted that the outbreak will only leave a slight dent in the economy.
* * *
As we move into the late evening hours of Sunday on mainland China, Taiwan has become the latest country or territory to report a virus-related fatality, the SCMP reports.
They join Hong Kong, Japan and the Philippines in having reported virus-related deaths outside China.
Here are the latest global totals from SCMP:
Island says fatality was a 60-year-old unlicensed taxi driver with chronic health problems.
Meanwhile, in the latest statement from the WHO, the international health organization seemed to back away from its newly hostile tone toward China, saying Beijing’s actions bought the world time, but “we don’t know how much time.”
As the world’s greatest minds examine the epidemic, it’s worth remembering that Bill Gates has repeatedly warned us that humanity isn’t ready for the next pandemic.
Now, he’s repeating those warnings to an even larger crowd – but this time, with far more gravitas.
The Microsoft founder warned everyone during a speaking engagement at a conference on Friday that a Covid-19 outbreak in Africa could overwhelm the continent’s health services and trigger “10 million deaths,” reported The Telegraph.
Gates’ warning at the 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Annual Meeting in Seattle on Friday came hours before Egypt’s ministry of health confirmed that a 33-year-old male foreigner who flew into Cairo International Airport had tested positive for the virus.
Authorities said the infected man had 17 contacts and many interactions at the airport before testing positive.
Gates said: “This is a huge challenge. We’ve always known the potential for a naturally caused, or intentionally caused, pandemic is one if the few things that could disrupt health systems and economies and cause more than 10 million excess deaths.”
“This could be particularly if it spreads in areas like sub-Saharan Africa and some Asia, it could be very, very dramatic.”
He added that Covid-19 is more concerning than Ebola because the rate of which the disease spreads is far faster.
“Ebola is terrible, but it’s not like a lightning flu,” he said.
“This coronavirus has a lot of similarities to a very bad flu, in terms of the death rate, so far more like the 1957 flu outbreak,” Gates said.
“This disease, if it’s in Africa it’s more dramatic than if it’s in China, even though I’m not trying to minimize what’s going on in China in any way,” he said.
The risk, as Gates points out, is that the virus could spread to Africa next, where governments, even governments that have been bracing for an outbreak by readying beds and quarantines while stockpiling supplies, might still risk a rapid transmission that could lead to a health crisis far worse than China.
On Saturday, Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (Africa CDC) director Dr. John Nkengasong said Africa CDC has been working with African countries “in preparedness and response to the disease.”
The Health Ministry in Eswatini, a tiny southern African country, identified its first suspected case of the deadly on Friday.
Director of Health Services in Eswatini, Dr. Vusi Magagula, said the person had been placed in quarantine, and blood samples have been taken for further analysis, reported SABC News.
“She presented with a fever and was at the hospital, then the rapid response team took over and took up the case. She came through the Ngwenya Port of Entry on February 6 having arrived from the Republic of South Africa.
“I don’t think she was presenting with any symptoms, we only picked her up on the 14th because she was already now in hospital, ill and had to be admitted to the isolation ward. So I guess when she passed through or even through Ngwenya border post, she didn’t have the symptoms.”
Meanwhile, the Chinese Ambassador to South Africa warned South African nationals in China to not return for fear the virus could spread.
The African continent does not need another crisis, already battling locust plagues and food shortages.
But still the close economic ties between China and Africa are difficult to ignore.
Africa is home to nearly one million Chinese, health officials across the continent are extremely worried that it’s only a matter of time before the breakout begins.
As we detailed previously, Ethiopia’s Bole International airport is the leading African gateway to and from China.
On average, 1500 passengers per day arrive from China. Ethiopia scans all passengers from Asia for symptoms, which essentially means taking their temperature.

Many of those passengers then fly on to other parts of Africa, where Chinese companies are doing business, and inadvertently spreading the virus to nations along the BRI (the Belt & Road Initiative). These are 2018 figures courtesy of Brookings.

The question of why no infections have been reported in Africa was raised via twitter by Jim Bianco, of Bianco Research, earlier this month: “did anyone on the continent actually get a testing kits to look for infected people?” he asked.
To date no infections on the continent of Africa have been reported. Why?
Only today, February 7, did anyone on the continent actually get a testing kits to look for infected people.
What will this number be in two weeks? https://t.co/4yoWJmNRlc
— Jim Bianco (@biancoresearch) February 7, 2020

Fast forward one week: As we noted above, a case has already been confirmed in Egypt with a suspected case in Eswatini. With the understanding that Ethiopia international airport is a continental gateway for the Chinese.
This could mean super-spreaders, during the incubation period, undetected by temperature readings or showing no symptoms, have likely invaded Africa from China via Ethiopia’s main airport, as it’s only a matter of time before cases on the continent could start increasing.
1000 Genomes Project has published a list of various types of people with the highest risks of contracting the virus. Several countries in Africa are seen on the list:

And oddly enough, Gates has been warning about how the world needs to “prepare for pandemics in the same serious way it prepares for war.”
At the 2017 Munich Security Conference, Gates asked world leaders to “imagine that somewhere in the world a new weapon exists or could emerge that is capable of killing millions of people, bringing economies to a standstill, and casting nations into chaos.
If it were a military weapon, the response would be to do everything possible to develop countermeasures,” he said at the 2017 event, adding that a “sense of urgency is lacking” when it comes to biologic threats.
The outbreak continues to worsen over the weekend, despite China’s National Health Commission’s optically pleasing phony statistics of how confirmed cases and deaths declined for the third straight day.
There were 2,009 new cases in mainland China on Sunday, bringing the total to 68,500.

The government of Hubei province, the center of China’s virus outbreak, told residents on Sunday evening that a ban on vehicle traffic across the region will go into immediate effect to prevent further transmission of the virus.
According to the new conditions, only police cars, ambulances, military vehicles, and cars hauling essential goods are permitted on roads.
Local authorities told companies not to resume work unless they have approval from officials, which will undoubtedly throw a wrench in the factories who were planning to open facilities last Monday.
They could now be delayed even longer, which would start creating shortages of goods destined for the West for the spring and summer retail season.
Meanwhile, health officials on mainland China recently reported 2,009 new infections and 142 deaths from the coronavirus on Sunday.
Hong Kong said it now had 57 cases of infection in the city after another man tested positive, while Hongkongers stranded on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan learned they will face another 14 days quarantine when they arrive home.
Meanwhile, as the US prepares its evacuation, 40 US passengers who have been infected have opted to go to a Japanese hospital rather than take the State Department flight. Anthony Fauci with the CDC said anyone showing symptoms of the virus will be blocked from the flight
On Sunday, the SCMP, one of the most reliable chroniclers of the outbreak, published a story that investors might want to take note of: The facemask shortage in China – a big component of the general shortage of medical supplies – likely won’t be over any time soon, and will likely spread to other countries.
Why? Because most of the big facemask makers are based in China, and their operations have been badly restricted by the outbreak.
China’s dominance in the global supply chain as a result of competitive pricing has come back to bite the country where it currently hurts the most – in the manufacturing of medical facial masks, a shortage of which is intensifying as the coronavirus continues to spread across the country and around the world.
Demand for masks has surged in recent weeks, exhausting not just China’s stockpile, but emptying shelves from Bangkok to Boston. In China, it is now mandatory to wear facial masks in public areas in many cities.
China, which accounts for about half of the world’s mask production, is scrambling to snap excess supply from overseas, both through official diplomatic channels, and buyers like Cai.
An update on the Diamond Princess, a virus- stricken cruise ship, held under quarantine in the Japanese port of Yokohama: Several countries with citizens aboard the ship have announced plans for an emergency evacuation following reports that passengers are literally going mad with paranoia.
Among them, the US is scheduling a charter plane for its 380 citizens aboard the ship. On Sunday, South Korea said it’s planning to evacuate 355 of its people from the vessel.
It was noted by Japanese authorities that anyone testing positive for the virus would not be able to leave.
However, the Hong Kongers, Americans and others among them will likely be less-than-pleased to learn that the clocks will restart and they will face another 14 day quarantine when they return.
As for the cruise ship docked in Cambodia, an American passenger tested positive for the virus on Sunday. The 83-year-old woman has been aboard the MS Westerdam, operated by Carnival Corp. The ship is carrying 1,455 passengers and 802 crew.
In Taiwan, it was confirmed on Sunday night that the first death related to the virus was seen, Health Minister Chen Shih-Chung told reporters.
The island’s health minister said the deceased man was in his sixties, had not traveled to China, and had diabetes and hepatitis B. This is the first death in the country with at least 20 confirmed cases.
It appears the World Health Organization (WHO) finally admitting the COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic, along with the announcement last week that there’s no vaccine for at least 12-18 months, is more than enough to recognize their “contained” narrative is bullsh*t, with new risks emerging of an outbreak in Africa.
Simultaneously, China’s economy is disintegrating at the seams, producing one of the most massive economic shocks not seen since the 2008/09 financial crisis, as nearly two-thirds of its economy has ground to a halt.
China was responsible for over half of the world’s credit creation in the last decade, and if China decelerates, so does the world.

 Is Bill Gates Profiting From The Outbreak? Or Is Something Far More Sinister Taking Place?,"As we see what is now being called a global health emergency regarding the coronavirus continue to grow on a daily basis, we also see how the solutions to this crisis fall in line with pre-positioned plans and agendas.
In this report, we look at a potential solution offered by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation which intends to provide at-home testing kits for those who believe they may have been exposed to, or may be possibly infected by the virus.
Is Bill Gates making money on this public health crisis? Or is there another motivation behind the 100 million dollars the foundation has donated to combat this outbreak?

 Coronavirus and the Sun: a Lesson from the 1918 Influenza Pandemic,"Fresh air, sunlight and improvised face masks seemed to work a century ago; and they might help us now.
by Richard Hobday, author of `The Healing Sun’
When new, virulent diseases emerge, such SARS and Covid-19, the race begins to find new vaccines and treatments for those affected.
As the current crisis unfolds, governments are enforcing quarantine and isolation, and public gatherings are being discouraged.

Health officials took the same approach 100 years ago, when influenza was spreading around the world.
The results were mixed. But records from the 1918 pandemic suggest one technique for dealing with influenza — little-known today — was effective.
Some hard-won experience from the greatest pandemic in recorded history could help us in the weeks and months ahead.
Put simply, medics found that severely ill flu patients nursed outdoors recovered better than those treated indoors.
A combination of fresh air and sunlight seems to have prevented deaths among patients; and infections among medical staff.[1]
There is scientific support for this. Research shows that outdoor air is a natural disinfectant. Fresh air can kill the flu virus and other harmful germs.
Equally, sunlight is germicidal and there is now evidence it can kill the flu virus.
`Open-Air’ Treatment in 1918
During the great pandemic, two of the worst places to be were military barracks and troop-ships. Overcrowding and bad ventilation put soldiers and sailors at high risk of catching influenza and the other infections that often followed it.[2,3]
As with the current Covid-19 outbreak, most of the victims of so-called `Spanish flu’ did not die from influenza: they died of pneumonia and other complications.
When the influenza pandemic reached the East coast of the United States in 1918, the city of Boston was particularly badly hit. So the State Guard set up an emergency hospital.
They took in the worst cases among sailors on ships in Boston harbour. The hospital’s medical officer had noticed the most seriously ill sailors had been in badly-ventilated spaces.
So he gave them as much fresh air as possible by putting them in tents. And in good weather they were taken out of their tents and put in the sun.
At this time, it was common practice to put sick soldiers outdoors. Open-air therapy, as it was known, was widely used on casualties from the Western Front.
And it became the treatment of choice for another common and often deadly respiratory infection of the time; tuberculosis.
Patients were put outside in their beds to breathe fresh outdoor air. Or they were nursed in cross-ventilated wards with the windows open day and night. The open-air regimen remained popular until antibiotics replaced it in the 1950s.
Doctors who had first-hand experience of open-air therapy at the hospital in Boston were convinced the regimen was effective. It was adopted elsewhere.
If one report is correct, it reduced deaths among hospital patients from 40 per cent to about 13 per cent.[4]
According to the Surgeon General of the Massachusetts State Guard:
`The efficacy of open air treatment has been absolutely proven, and one has only to try it to discover its value.’
Fresh Air is a Disinfectant
Patients treated outdoors were less likely to be exposed to the infectious germs that are often present in conventional hospital wards.
They were breathing clean air in what must have been a largely sterile environment. We know this because, in the 1960s, Ministry of Defence scientists proved that fresh air is a natural disinfectant.[5]
Something in it, which they called the Open Air Factor, is far more harmful to airborne bacteria — and the influenza virus — than indoor air.
They couldn’t identify exactly what the Open Air Factor is. But they found it was effective both at night and during the daytime.
Their research also revealed that the Open Air Factor’s disinfecting powers can be preserved in enclosures — if ventilation rates are kept high enough.
Significantly, the rates they identified are the same ones that cross-ventilated hospital wards, with high ceilings and big windows, were designed for.[6]
But by the time the scientists made their discoveries, antibiotic therapy had replaced open-air treatment. Since then the germicidal effects of fresh air have not featured in infection control, or hospital design. Yet harmful bacteria have become increasingly resistant to antibiotics.
Sunlight and Influenza Infection
Putting infected patients out in the sun may have helped because it inactivates the influenza virus.[7] It also kills bacteria that cause lung and other infections in hospitals.[8] During the First World War, military surgeons routinely used sunlight to heal infected wounds.[9]
They knew it was a disinfectant. What they didn’t know is that one advantage of placing patients outside in the sun is they can synthesise vitamin D in their skin if sunlight is strong enough.
This was not discovered until the 1920s. Low vitamin D levels are now linked to respiratory infections and may increase susceptibility to influenza.[10]
Also, our body’s biological rhythms appear to influence how we resist infections.[11] New research suggests they can alter our inflammatory response to the flu virus.[12]
As with vitamin D, at the time of the 1918 pandemic, the important part played by sunlight in synchronizing these rhythms was not known.
Face Masks Coronavirus and Flu
Surgical masks are currently in short supply in China and elsewhere. They were worn 100 years ago, during the great pandemic, to try and stop the influenza virus spreading.
While surgical masks may offer some protection from infection they do not seal around the face.
So they don’t filter out small airborne particles. In 1918, anyone at the emergency hospital in Boston who had contact with patients had to wear an improvised face mask. This comprised five layers of gauze fitted to a wire frame which covered the nose and mouth.
The frame was shaped to fit the face of the wearer and prevent the gauze filter touching the mouth and nostrils. The masks were replaced every two hours; properly sterilized and with fresh gauze put on.
They were a forerunner of the N95 respirators in use in hospitals today to protect medical staff against airborne infection.
Temporary Hospitals
Staff at the hospital kept up high standards of personal and environmental hygiene. No doubt this played a big part in the relatively low rates of infection and deaths reported there.
The speed with which their hospital and other temporary open-air facilities were erected to cope with the surge in pneumonia patients was another factor.
Today, many countries are not prepared for a severe influenza pandemic.[13]
Their health services will be overwhelmed if there is one. Vaccines and antiviral drugs might help. Antibiotics may be effective for pneumonia and other complications. But much of the world’s population will not have access to them.
If another 1918 comes, or the Covid-19 crisis gets worse, history suggests it might be prudent to have tents and pre-fabricated wards ready to deal with large numbers of seriously ill cases. Plenty of fresh air and a little sunlight might help too.

 Coronavirus Censorship Promoted In Pandemic Exercise Is Now Happening,"In my recent report titled “Did Bill Gates & World Economic Forum Predict Coronavirus Outbreak? An Inside Look May Shock You!” we took a close look at Event 201, which was a pandemic exercise that simulated a coronavirus outbreak that killed 65 million people.
The simulation took place shortly before the actual coronavirus outbreak occurred.
In the simulation, the participants of the exercise — which included representatives from the UN, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the media, vaccine manufacturers, major banks and the Chinese and American CDC just to name a few — discussed how it was critically important to control news and information, especially on social media.

Just as the simulation itself seems to eerily predict the coronavirus outbreak, we are beginning to see other scenarios in the simulation come to fruition as well, such as travel bans, a negative impact on the economy as well as censorship.
Now we see Facebook, Twitter and Google, which owns YouTube, have all vowed to stop “misinformation.” Watch the video report to find out more, as ZeroHedge was just banned from Twitter.

 Does the Push for Mass Vaccination Point Toward a Staged Bioterror Event?,"We’ve seen the signs. I’ve been highlighting them. The infamous childhood mandatory vaccination law in California. Other states that are considering similar bills.
The lunatic push in Australia to outlaw medical exemptions from vaccination. The all-out campaign in the press, in various countries, to stigmatize people who defect from official “truth” about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.
On a larger stage, over the past 20 years, we’ve seen the promotion of fake “pandemics” demanding universal vaccination to ward off “millions of deaths”: SARS, West Nile, Swine Flu, smallpox, etc. All duds.
Now we have the boggling case of the University of Massachusetts, where two supposed instances of meningitis have triggered an immediate campaign (video 1, video 2) to vaccinate all 20,000 students against meningococcal B meningitis.
It’s clear that the logistics of carrying out such an extensive program have been in place for some time. The University just needed an occasion for a test launch of the system. Now they have it.
Yet USA Today reports:
“Sarah Van Orman, a physician and executive director of University Health Services at UW-Madison, said… the new [meningitis] B vaccine… may not be as effective as the routinely given vaccine against the four other major bacteria strains.”
“In a study of 499 Princeton University students who received the new B vaccine during an outbreak there, up to a third did not show a good immune response eight weeks after the second dose, Van Orman said.”
“Some research suggests the vaccine also may provide immunity only for six to 12 months, she said.”
But it’s full steam ahead for the U of Massachusetts. Other colleges have long been making preparations. For example, the University of Rochester, according to its Newscenter (September 19, 2014):
“On Thursday, Oct. 30, University Health Service (UHS) staff will attempt to vaccinate 5,000 students, faculty and staff against this year’s flu virus [in one day]. The effort will doubly serve as a test of emergency preparedness to practice delivering mass quantities of vaccine or drug in response to an urgent public health concern.
“The effort is being coordinated by UHS, RC/MERT (University of Rochester River Campus Medical Emergency Response Team), University Environmental Health & Safety and the Monroe County Office of Emergency Preparedness…’We will have to give about 600 vaccinations an hour to meet our goal,’ said Ralph Manchester, MD, vice provost and UHS director.”
Understand: this was a test of a system, an emergency system. That was the primary goal of the operation.
Piece by piece, in the US — and undoubtedly in other countries — the groundwork is being laid for huge networks that can, at a moment’s notice, go live and mass-vaccinate extraordinary numbers of people.
And they would do exactly that—upon the announcement of a “new deadly pandemic that threatens the population.”
How would the “pandemic” occur—or rather, how could it be staged?
Obviously, the vaccine itself could be a carrier, since all sorts of new toxins could be covertly inserted, in addition to the more familiar toxic substances already present in vaccines.
But beyond that?
Here is backgrounder I wrote on the subject: How to Stage a Bioterror Event:
The germ is the cover story for chemical destruction.
In general, the primary fact is: no matter what kind of germ you’re talking about or where it came from, releasing it intentionally does not guarantee predictable results. Far from it.
For instance, people whose immune systems are at different levels of strength are going to react differently.
The perpetrators may find that far less than 1% of people exposed get sick.
Therefore: use a chemical and claim it is a germ.
In other words, there is no germ attack. It’s called a germ attack, but that’s a lie. The perps bring in researchers to the affected area, who go on to claim they have isolated a germ that is the cause of death and illness.
It’s a sham. What really happened was the spread of a toxic chemical that can’t be detected, unless you’re looking for it.
The chemical has severe, deadly, and predictable effects for a week or two. Then it disperses and loses potency and the “epidemic” is done.
In some town, a fairly isolated community, the word goes out that people are suddenly falling ill and dying. The CDC and the Army are called in to cordon off the area and quarantine all citizens. A peremptory announcement is made, early on, that this is a biowar attack.
Major media are allowed outside the periphery. Network news anchors set up on-location and do their wall to wall broadcasts “from the scene.”
The entire nation, the entire world is riveted on the event, 24/7.
People inside the cordon fall ill and die. Reports emerge from the town:
The networks state that “heroic doctors are taking samples of blood and the blood is being analyzed to find the germ that is causing the epidemic.” The DoD confirms over and over that this is, indeed, a biowar attack.
Human interest stories pile up. This family lost three members, that family lost everybody. Tragedy, horror, and the desired empathic response from “the world community.”
It’s a soap opera, except real people are dying.
The medical cartel promotes fear of the germ.
All controlling entities get to obtain their piece of the terrorist pie.
Finally, the doctors announce they have isolated the germ causing death, and researchers are rushing to develop a vaccine (which they produce in record time).
Everyone everywhere must be vaccinated, now. No choice. Do it or be quarantined or jailed.
—Mass vaccination clinics emerge from the shadows, all over the nation. They are ready to go. The system is in place. Everyone must get the vaccine now.
In this declared martial law situation, the doctors are the heroes. The doctors and the Army. And the government, and even the media.
Then, after a few weeks, when the potency of the secret chemical has dispersed, it’s over.
When you think about it, this scenario is a rough approximation of what happens every day, all over the world, in doctors’ offices.
The doctors are prescribing chemicals (drugs) whose effects are far more dangerous than germs that may (or may not) be causing patients to be ill.
In other words, a chem-war attack is being leveled at people all over the world all the time.
See Dr. Barbara Starfield (Johns Hopkins School of Public Health), July 26, 2000, Journal of the American Medical Association, “Is US health really the best in the world.”
106,000 people in America are killed every year by FDA-approved medical drugs. That’s a million people per decade.
In the wake of a staged “biowar” terror attack, new laws are enacted. The State clamps down harder on basic freedoms. The right to travel is curtailed. Criticizing the authorities is viewed as highly illegal. Freedom of assembly is limited.
“Citizens must cooperate. We’re all in this together.”
A new federal law mandating the CDC schedule of vaccines for every child and adult—no exceptions permitted—is rushed through the Congress and signed by the President.
It’s all based on a lie…in the same way that the disease theory of the medical cartel is based on a lie: the strength of an individual’s immune system is the basic determinant of health or illness, not germs considered in a vacuum.
There are people who are determined to inflate the dangers of germs. They trumpet every “new” germ as the end of humankind on the planet. They especially sound the alarm when researchers claim a germ may have mutated or jumped from animals to humans.
“This is it! We’re done for!”
However, if you check into actual confirmed cases of death from recent so-called epidemics, such as West Nile, SARS, bird flu (H5N1), Swine Flu (H1N1), and MERS, the numbers of deaths are incredibly low.
If political criminals, behind the scenes, wanted to stage a confined “biowar” event, they would choose a chemical, not a germ, and they would leverage such an event to curtail freedom.
Understand: researchers behind sealed doors in labs can claim, with unassailable ease, that they’ve found a germ that causes an outbreak. Almost no one challenges such an assertion.
This was the case, for example, with the vaunted SARS epidemic (a dud), in 2003, when 10 World Health Organization (WHO) labs, walled off from view, in communication with each other via closed circuit, announced they’d isolated a coronavirus as the culprit.
Later, in Canada, a WHO microbiologist, Frank Plummer, wandered off the reservation and told reporters he was puzzled by the fact that fewer and fewer SARS patients “had the coronavirus.”
This was tantamount to confessing that the whole research effort had been a failure and a sham—but after a day or so of coverage, the press fell silent.
SARS was a nonsensical farce. Diagnosed patients had ordinary seasonal flu or a collection of familiar symptoms that could result from many different causes.
But the propaganda effort was a stunning success. Populations were frightened. The need for vaccines, in the public mind, was exacerbated.
Exacerbated; and prepared, for the “next one.”
…Until eventually — a chemical attack would be called a germ attack.
A staged reality.

" Zika Fraud Update, Rio Olympics, the Op Against Brazil","For new readers, see my previous articles about the scientific fraud that is Zika. In a nutshell, there is no convincing evidence the Zika virus causes the birth defect called microcephaly.
by Jon Rappoport
There are only news headlines. The latest of these refer to two new studies “clinching” the Zika-microcephaly connection. However, the studies are nothing more than propaganda.
One study claims that, in several groups of mothers and babies born with the defect, the Zika virus was found. But at best, it was found in a small minority of cases studied.
This weak correlation proves nothing. In fact, it is evidence against Zika as the cause. Why? Because scientific standards dictate that the virus should be found in all, or an overwhelming percentage of, cases.
The other study was done on mice. Needless to say, mice are not humans. In fact, mice are far from ideal animals to study, when inferences to human are going to be made.
The CDC and the World Health Organization are determined to weld Zika to microcephaly. Scientifically, they’ve utterly failed, but that doesn’t stop them. They can get headlines, and that’s all they care about.
Brazil, as everyone knows, has been made the target of the hysteria surrounding Zika. And the Rio Olympics are coming up shortly.
Obviously, many tourists are going to stay home because they fear Zika. This could cut deeply into expected profits the Games generate.
“Brazil is a terrible place to visit; Zika is rampant; run from the virus.”
More importantly, the global political scene is experiencing a ripple of disruption owing to what are called the BRICS nations—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
This alliance is establishing its own monetary fund, independent of the IMF, and conversation have been held about defecting from the US dollar as the currency of choice in all sales of oil.
From the US government’s point of view, this toppling of the dollar must never happen. It was one reason Libya was destroyed. Ghaddafi was in the process of promoting a gold-backed currency (not the dollar) to be used in oil transactions.
Therefore, Brazil, as a BRICS nation, comes under the political gun. The entirely fraudulent Zika crisis is one vector in that attack.
Unfortunately, people are inexperienced in making connections between political/economic attacks, and medical ops. So they can’t see the links. But the links are there.
Since 1988, I’ve been detailing them. Just to take one example, the manufactured 2003 crisis called SARS was used, by the World Health Organization, to show it could bring a large city to its knees. WHO issued a travel advisory against flying into a “SARS epicenter,” Toronto.
The city lost billions in tourism revenue. SARS had no basis in reality. The supposed cause, a coronavirus, was found in fewer and fewer patients — until the whole op was exposed as a rank fraud, for those who were paying attention.
Read: Zika Virus Was Isolated by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1947
In the case of the Rio Olympics, WHO hasn’t come out and advised the Games organizers to cancel or move the events. It doesn’t need to. It’s already stirred up enough fear to produce a deep cut in tourism money.
And after all, the globally televised Games will create an ideal opportunity to push more Zika fear at viewers.
The CDC and WHO are the Ministry of Fear. They use that emotion to front for pharmaceutical companies, who in turn sell vaccines and drugs.
“Be afraid. But don’t worry, we can help you and save you.”
If you buy that formula, I have some wonderful and inexpensive condos for sale on the dark side of the moon.
Bottom line: Any doofus can say, “Look, here is a disease, and I’ve found a particular virus is present in a few cases, so the virus causes the disease.”
Any doofus can say that, but he isn’t a real scientist, no matter how many credentials he has attached to his name. He might be a salesman, he might be a propagandist, he might be an incompetent, but he isn’t a scientist.
The most recent numbers I’ve found out of Brazil state that, in 854 confirmed cases of microcephaly, 97 were found with some trace of the Zika virus.
That’s called evidence that Zika isn’t the cause. In any reasonable lab, the researchers would say, “Well, we go back to the drawing board. Far too many cases that don’t have the virus.”
But we aren’t dealing with reasonable people. We’re dealing with an agenda. And the agenda must be pushed, for purposes that have nothing to do with science or healing.

 Clinical Trials of Intravenous Vitamin C Treatments for Coronavirus Commence in China,"Researchers in China have begun clinical trials on the use of intravenous vitamin C as a remedy for the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19).
While government health authorities focus on pharmaceuticals and vaccines, Dr. Richard Cheng and his colleagues are investigating the simplicity with which injecting natural vitamin C can help to prevent the deadly outcomes increasingly associated with this novel disease.
One of the key mechanisms for fatality associated with the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) is its propensity to cause acute organ failure, and especially pulmonary failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The rapid release of free radicals, cytokines, and other damaging hallmarks of ARDS creates an onslaught of oxidative stress that can lead to cellular injury, organ failure, and/or death.

Intravenous Vitamin C Doubles Effectiveness Of Chemotherapy And Radiation, Which is Most Probably the Reason Why the FDA Moved Quietly to Ban It
Intravenous vitamin C, however, being a powerful antioxidant, can prevent this type of oxidative damage and cytokine storm by minimizing their impact, increasing a patient’s chances of survival and full recovery.
Of the 138 confirmed cases that Dr. Cheng and his colleagues looked at, 26 percent had to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), while 4.3 percent died. Out of 99 other confirmed cases they looked at, 17 percent of patients developed ARDS, and among these, 11 percent experienced dramatically worsened symptoms over a short period of time that led to multiple organ failure and death.
“Increased oxidative stress, an underlying ‘cytokine storm,’ leads to ARDS which is the key pathology of high mortality of these pandemic viral infections,” Dr. Cheng and his colleagues write. “Cytokine storm-induced ARDS is the key pathology leading to death of these patients. Intravenous vitamin C effectively counters oxidative stress.”
One of the most often causes of death from a respiratory infection is a cytokine storm
As it turns out, one of the most common causes of death from influenza, coronavirus, and other similar respiratory infections is a cytokine storm, which is basically an inflammatory response that’s so severe it ends up harming the body to the point of serious injury or death.
Vitamin C can help to mitigate this uncontrolled cytokine response, keeping it at a lower, safer threshold for healing rather than further injury. But because it’s a natural remedy, vitamin C isn’t being talked about by the mainstream media as even a possible remedy for this out-of-control outbreak that continues to spread in countries all around the world.
We have seen some reports about the use of all-natural oxygen therapy, at least in South Korea where officials there say they’ve successfully treated at least one serious case of the Wuhan coronavirus (CoVid-19) with it.
Keep in mind that intravenous vitamin C is a clinically-proven therapy for many other ailments, including cancer, and has been affirmed as beneficial by experts at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School – so it’s not some “woo-woo” remedy as the “skeptics” get a kick out of claiming.
“This is important in clinical management … [s]ince the prevention and management targeting increased oxidative stress with large doses of antioxidants seems a logical step and can be applied to these deadly pandemics, without the lengthy waiting for pathogen-specific vaccines and drugs, as is the case of the current 2019-nCov epidemic,” Dr. Cheng and his colleagues conclude.
“We call upon all those in the leadership, and those providing direct assistance to patients, to bravely and rapidly apply large dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) to help those patients and to stop this epidemic.”

 Italian Virologist Said Fears of Racism Slowed Down Coronavirus Response,"An Italian virologist has said that fears of being accused of racism slowed the Italian government’s initial response to the coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic.
Dr. Giorgio Palù is a Professor of Virology and Microbiology at the University of Padova, and he was formerly the President of the European and Italian Society for Virology.
In an interview with CNN, he said that the reason the disease has struck Italy so fiercely is because the government delayed imposing travel restrictions on people coming from China until it was too late. He said the country’s response was “lazy in the beginning” because of “too much politics.”

“There was a proposal to isolate people coming from the epicenter, coming from China,” Palù told CNN. “Then it became seen as racist, but they were people coming from the outbreak.”
Since then, Italy has become the hardest-hit country in the world after China, and has had the most victims in Europe by far. The first confirmed cases of the infection in Italy were found in two Chinese tourists in January.
As of now there have been nearly 36,000 confirmed cases, and nearly 4,000 people have died from the disease.
The shortsightedness of Italy’s government regarding the virus as a result of political correctness has not been limited to the national government.
Dario Nardella, the Mayor of Florence, who is from the Left-wing Democratic Party, was urging Italians to “hug a Chinese” in early February out of concerns that coronavirus fears were leading to racism against the Chinese. Nardella even tweeted a video of himself hugging a Chinese man.
#coronavirus: seguiamo le indicazioni delle autorità sanitarie e usiamo cautela, ma nessun terrorismo psicologico e soprattutto basta con i soliti sciacalli che non vedevano l’ora di usare questa scusa per odiare e insultare. Uniti in questa battaglia comune! #AbbracciaUnCinese pic.twitter.com/pUdqEl0piW
— Dario Nardella (@DarioNardella) February 1, 2020

Other videos from February show Chinese people getting hugs from Italian passersby.

Northern Italy has now become the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy.
The Governor of Lombardy has recently warned citizens that they must follow the curfew strictly as the hospitals will soon be overwhelmed with patients, as reported by La Repubblica, and after that it may no longer be possible to treat all of the victims.
Hungary has not hesitated to point out the link between immigration and the coronavirus epidemic.
“We have seen that it was mostly foreigners who brought in the disease, and that it is mostly spreading among foreigners,” Hungary’s Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, said on Friday, as previously reported by Voice of Europe.
“We are fighting a two-front war. One front is called migration, and the other one belongs to the coronavirus.”

 China’s Coronavirus: A Shocking Update. Did The Virus Originate in the US?,"The Western media quickly took the stage and laid out the official narrative for the outbreak of the new coronavirus which appeared to have begun in China, claiming it to have originated with animals at a wet market in Wuhan.
In fact the origin was for a long time unknown but it appears likely now, according to Chinese and Japanese reports, that the virus originated elsewhere, from multiple locations, but began to spread widely only after being introduced to the market.
More to the point, it appears that the virus did not originate in China and, according to reports in Japanese and other media, may have originated in the US.

Chinese Researchers Conclude the Virus Originated Outside of China
After collecting samples of the genome in China, medical researchers first conclusively demonstrated that the virus did not originate at the seafood market but had multiple unidentified sources, after which it was exposed to the seafood market from where it spread everywhere. (1) (2) (3)

According to the Global Times:
A new study by Chinese researchers indicates the novel coronavirus may have begun human-to-human transmission in late November from a place other than the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
The study published on ChinaXiv, a Chinese open repository for scientific researchers, reveals the new coronavirus was introduced to the seafood market from another location(s), and then spread rapidly from the market due to the large number of close contacts.
The findings were the result of analyses of the genome data, sources of infection, and the route of spread of variations of the novel coronavirus collected throughout China.
The study believes that patient(s) zero transmitted the virus to workers or sellers at the Huanan seafood market, the crowded market easily facilitating further transmission of the virus to buyers, which caused a wider spread in early December 2019. (Global Times, February 22, 2020, emphasis added (2)
Chinese medical authorities – and “intelligence agencies” – then conducted a rapid and wide-ranging search for the origin of the virus, collecting nearly 100 samples of the genome from 12 different countries on 4 continents, identifying all the varieties and mutations.
During this research, they determined the virus outbreak had begun much earlier, probably in November, shortly after the Wuhan Military Games.
They then came to the same independent conclusions as the Japanese researchers – that the virus did not begin in China but was introduced there from the outside.
China’s top respiratory specialist Zhong Nanshan said on January 27:
“Though the COVID-19 was first discovered in China, it does not mean that it originated from China. But that is Chinese for “it originated someplace else, in another country”. (4)
This of course raises questions as to the actual location of origin. If the authorities pursued their analysis through 100 genome samples from 12 countries, they must have had a compelling reason to be searching for the original source outside China.
This would explain why there was such difficulty in locating and identifying a ‘patient zero’.
Japan’s Media: The Coronavirus May Have Originated in the US
In February of 2020, the Japanese Asahi news report (print and TV) claimed the coronavirus originated in the US, not in China, and that some (or many) of the 14,000 American deaths attributed to influenza may have in fact have resulted from the coronavirus. (5)

A report from a Japanese TV station disclosing a suspicion that some of those Americans may have unknowningly contracted the coronavirus has gone viral on Chinese social media, stoking fears and speculations in China that the novel coronavirus may have originated in the US.
The report, by TV Asahi Corporation of Japan, suggested that the US government may have failed to grasp how rampant the virus has gone on US soil.
However, it is unknown whether Americans who have already died of the influenza had contracted the coronavirus, as reported by TV Asahi. (People’s Daily, English, February 23, 2020, emphasis added)
On February 14, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said they will begin to test individuals with influenza-like-illness for the novel coronavirus at public health labs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago, and New York City.
The TV Asahi network presented scientific documentation for their claims, raising the issue that no one would know the cause of death because the US either neglected to test or failed to release the results.
Japan avoided the questions of natural vs. man-made and accidental vs. deliberate, simply stating that the virus outbreak may first have occurred in the US. The Western Internet appears to have been scrubbed of this information, but the Chinese media still reference it.
These claims stirred up a hornet’s nest not only in Japan but in China, immediately going viral on Chinese social media, especially since the Military World Games were held in Wuhan in October, and it had already been widely discussed that the virus could have been transmitted at that time – from a foreign source.
“Perhaps the US delegates brought the coronavirus to Wuhan, and some mutation occurred to the virus, making it more deadly and contagious, and causing a widespread outbreak this year.” (People’s Daily, February 23, 2020) (1)
Shen Yi, an international relations professor at Shanghai’s Fudan University, stated that global virologists “including the intelligence agencies” were tracking the origin of the virus.
Also of interest, the Chinese government did not shut the door on this. The news report stated:
“Netizens are encouraged to actively partake in discussions, but preferably in a rational fashion.”
In China, that is meaningful. If the reports were rubbish, the government would clearly state that, and tell people to not spread false rumors.
Taiwan Virologist Suggests the Coronavirus Originated in the US
Then, Taiwan ran a TV news program on February,27,(click here to access video (Chinese), that presented diagrams and flow charts suggesting the coronavirus originated in the US. (6)

Below is a rough translation, summary and analysis of selected content of that newscast (see map below).
The man in the video is a top virologist and pharmacologist who performed a long and detailed search for the source of the virus.
He spends the first part of the video explaining the various haplotypes (varieties, if you will), and explains how they are related to each other, how one must have come before another, and how one type derived from another.
He explains this is merely elementary science and nothing to do with geopolitical issues, describing how, just as with numbers in order, 3 must always follow 2.

One of his main points is that the type infecting Taiwan exists only in Australia and the US and, since Taiwan was not infected by Australians, the infection in Taiwan could have come only from the US.
The basic logic is that the geographical location with the greatest diversity of virus strains must be the original source because a single strain cannot emerge from nothing.
He demonstrated that only the US has all the five known strains of the virus (while Wuhan and most of China have only one, as do Taiwan and South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, Singapore, and England, Belgium and Germany), constituting a thesis that the haplotypes in other nations may have originated in the US.
Korea and Taiwan have a different haplotype of the virus than China, perhaps more infective but much less deadly, which would account for a death rate only 1/3 that of China.
Neither Iran nor Italy were included in the above tests, but both countries have now deciphered the locally prevalent genome and have declared them of different varieties from those in China, which means they did not originate in China but were of necessity introduced from another source.
It is worth noting that the variety in Italy has approximately the same fatality rate as that of China, three times as great as other nations, while the haplotype in Iran appears to be the deadliest with a fatality rate of between 10% and 25%. (7) (8) (9)
Due to the enormous amount of Western media coverage focused on China, much of the world believes the coronavirus spread to all other nations from China, but this now appears to have been proven wrong.
With about 50 nations scattered throughout the world having identified at least one case at the time of writing, it would be very interesting to examine virus samples from each of those nations to determine their location of origin and the worldwide sources and patterns of spread.
The Virologist further stated that the US has recently had more than 200 “pulmonary fibrosis” cases that resulted in death due to patients’ inability to breathe, but whose conditions and symptoms could not be explained by pulmonary fibrosis.
He said he wrote articles informing the US health authorities to consider seriously those deaths as resulting from the coronavirus, but they responded by blaming the deaths on e-cigarettes, then silenced further discussion. …
The Taiwanese doctor then stated the virus outbreak began earlier than assumed, saying, “We must look to September of 2019”.
He stated the case in September of 2019 where some Japanese traveled to Hawaii and returned home infected, people who had never been to China.
This was two months prior to the infections in China and just after the CDC suddenly and totally shut down the Fort Detrick bio-weapons lab claiming the facilities were insufficient to prevent loss of pathogens. (10) (11)
He said he personally investigated those cases very carefully (as did the Japanese virologists who came to the same conclusion)… This might indicate the coronavirus had already spread in the US but where the symptoms were being officially attributed to other diseases, and thus possibly masked.
The prominent Chinese news website Huanqiu related one case in the US where a woman’s relative was told by physicians he died of the flu, but where the death certificate listed the coronavirus as the cause of death.
On February 26, ABC News affiliate KJCT8 News Network reported that a woman recently told the media that her sister died on from coronavirus infection.
Montrose, Colorado resident Almeta Stone said, “They (the medical staff) kept us informed that it was the flu, and when I got the death certificate, there was a coronavirus in the cause of death.” (12)
We cannot ascertain the number of such cases in the US but since the CDC apparently has no reliable test kits and is conducting little or no testing for the virus, there may be others.

" Red Algae Extract Fights Ebola, HIV, SARS and HCV","While researchers scramble to develop a vaccine or monoclonal antibody against the Ebola virus – and continue to develop chemo treatments to stem HIV and Hepatitis-C while fearing SARS – nature has already provided a natural treatment.
Research has shown that a healthy strong immune system can allow a person to not only avoid contracting the disease – but become resistant to it as well.
For those of us who need help or extract assurance, red algae proves to provide a key antiviral.
Hunting Natural Immunity For Ebola
After the two 1996 Ebola outbreaks in Gabon Africa, medical scientists determined that about Ebola causes death among about 70 percent of those who contracted the virus.
This question led researchers from Gabon’s Franceville International Center of Medical Research to investigate. The questions ensued: Why don’t the other 30 percent die? How do 30 percent of those infected recover?
Furthermore, medical researchers found many instances where there were close contacts of those who became infected who never were infected at all. Even though they were in contact with the infected patient while the patient was symptomatic.
Note: An infected patient with Ebola must be symptomatic in order to be contagious – with fever and other flu-like symptoms. A person must also have direct mucosal or blood contact in order to become infected with the virus. This means a transfer of saliva, urine, semen or blood from one person to another.
Thus, when the researchers investigated “close contact” individuals, they focused upon those who had this sort of exposure.
Ebola Antibodies
The research found that nearly half of those who were asymptomatic and seemingly immune developed antibodies (IgM and IgG) to the Ebola virus.
This means these individuals certainly were intimately exposed to the virus, but simply naturally developed the immunity tools – including those discussed below – that prevented the infection from replicating out of control.
Furthermore, the asymptomatic group exhibited greater anti-inflammatory responses in general. They were found to have higher levels of circulating cytokines and chemokines – which speed up the body’s natural ability to break down the viral cells and stop their activity within the body.
They concluded:
“Asymptomatic individuals had a strong inflammatory response by high circulating concentrations of cytokines and chemokines.”
Mannose-Binding Lectins Attack Ebola Virus
The particular mechanism with which the body naturally breaks down and prevents infection from lethal infections including Ebola, HIV, HCV and SARS has gradually emerged.
The mechanism is called mannose-binding lectins. Mannose-binding lectins are apparently produced in the human body via a DNA sequence, called the MBL2.
When this part of our genes is in order, the body will produce and release these mannose-binding lectins into the bloodstream. Mannose-binding lectins will then recognize and glom onto certain carbohydrate molecules that cover and make up various microorganisms.
These include fungi, bacteria and even parasites, which utilize glycoprotein shells to protect themselves. But they also include viruses. Once the lectins attach to these shells, they will break apart the surface of the microbe and basically break them down, allowing the body’s other immune cells to kill off the microbe and prevent it from replicating.
In fact, a healthy body that produces good levels of these mannose-binding lectins will be able to easily fight off colds and flus, as well as other microbial infections. Several animal studies have shown mannose-binding lectins heartily beat down coronaviruses and infectious bronchitis.
Research over the past five years has found that low levels of mannose-binding lectins increases the risk of respiratory infections, including syncytial virus infections, pneumonia and others.
For example, in a study of 121 children, RSV-infections were associated with low levels of mannose-binding lectins. Nearly 70 percent of RSV-infected children had low levels of mannose-binding lectins. But other infections – especially those related to bacterial infections – are not necessarily connected with mannose-binding lectin levels.
When it comes to virulent infections such as Ebola, Hepatitis C and HIV, however, these are different. These viruses come with glycoprotein shells that protect the virus from being broken down.
Furthermore, the glycoprotein shell of the Ebola virus produces glycoproteins that damage cells, allowing the virus to penetrate and replicate within the cell.
Mannose-binding lectins actually break down this shell and the glycoprotein matrix through a mechanism called the lectin pathway.
Humans that don’t produce enough of these mannose-binding lectins are not only more susceptible because they don’t have enough lectins, but they are typically also immunosuppressed with regard to the rest of their immune system.
One of the reason some humans don’t produce enough mannose-binding lectins is because of a slight genetic mutation, where the MBL2 gene is switched off. The reason for this mutation/switch-off has yet to be fully understood. (Guess – something to do with our toxic environment and/or nutritional deficiency.)
Mannose-Binding Lectins From Red Algae
This brings us to the fun part. Yes, humans aren’t the only critters that produce mannose-binding lectins. Red algae also produce these profusely, which allow the algae to protect themselves from invasion by viruses.
The most promising form of mannose-binding lectins is a component of the Scytonema varium red algae called Scytovirin. The protein extract was isolated by researchers from the National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Maryland in 2003. The protein contains 95 amino acids, and was found to bind to HIV-1 viral shells.
A similar antiviral protein was found in Nostoc ellipsosporum – called Cyanovirin-N. Both of these antiviral proteins did similar things – they broke down the glycoprotein shells of HIV and HCV.
Yet another anti-viral extract was found from the New Zealand red alga species, Griffithsia sp. This protein is called Griffithsin, abbreviated with GRFT.
Over the next few years, Griffithsin was tested against HIV-1 with great success in laboratory studies, which included studies with mice. The epidemic-potential virus SARS was also tested against Griffithsin, also with great success.
Multiple studies illustrated these effects. Research from the Center for Cancer Research in Frederick, Maryland found that Griffithsin not only stopped HIV-1 virus replication, but stopped cellular intrusion of the virus.
In 2010 Harvard researchers tested a recombinant version of Griffithsin – called rhMBL – against Ebola. Once again, they found the mannose-binding lectins were able to not only breakdown the viral shells of the Ebola, but when given to mice infected with Ebola, the mice became immune to the virus.
Yes, when the mice given the recombinant mannose-binding lectins were rechallenged with the Ebola virus, they were found to be immune to the Ebola virus.
Since that study other research has tested other animals with Griffithsin, with similar results.
Recombinant Griffithsin Produced in Nicotiana Benthamiana PlantsAs modern medical researchers continually strive for isolated and synthesized versions of nature able to be patented, recombinant versions of Griffithsin were eventually produced using Nicotiana benthamiana plants (a relative of the tobacco plant). These plants were genetically modified so they would produce the same mannose-binding lectins.
This form of Griffithsin was tested on mice and guinea pigs infected with HIV-1, with successful antiviral results.
This was also found when testing the recombinant Griffithsin on Ebola-infected mice. In all the studies, the Griffithsin was found to be safe and tolerated.
As to whether red algae can be taken in natural form to increase immunity, there is no doubt this is the case. Prior to this antiviral research that has spiraled into biopharm research, red algae had been shown to have antiviral and anticancer effects.
So the most logical answer is “yes” – certainly consuming red algae in supplement form has been found to boost antiviral immunity, and from the available research, blood levels of mannose-binding lectins. This should in turn boost immunity and create a natural method of preventing and even treating viral infections such as Ebola, SARS, HIV and Hepatitis-C.
Of course, this strategy should be used with other natural immunity-boosting strategies.
Other plants also produce these mannose-binding lectins, some of which have been used in traditional medicines. A study from Belgium’s University of Leuven studied 33 different plant lectins, and found 10 different mannose-binding lectins among the plants that inhibited coronovirus, and intervened upon the replication cycle of SARS-CoV.

 Former UK Prime Minister Calls For Global Government to Fight Coronavirus,"Former Prime Minister of the UK Gordon Brown has called on world leaders to create “a temporary form of global government” to fight the coronavirus outbreak.
Brown wants international organizations like the WHO and the UN to be given executive powers that would supersede national sovereignty as part of a new system overseen by world leaders and health experts.
“This is not something that can be dealt with in one country,” he said. “There has to be a coordinated global response.”

An international task force would “make sure the efforts of central banks were coordinated,” help find a vaccine and prevent profiteering according to Brown, who wants more money and power given to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
“We need some sort of working executive,” Brown said.
“If I were doing it again, I would make the G20 a broader organisation because in the current circumstances you need to listen to the countries that are most affected, the countries that are making a difference and countries where there is the potential for a massive number of people to be affected – such as those in Africa.”
As we have exhaustively documented, it was globalism that helped spread the pandemic in the first place.
Even as the virus was raging through China, the World Health Organization repeatedly insisted that countries should not impose any border controls.
When many western countries finally did close their borders weeks later it was too little too late.

" Natural Ways to Boost Your Immunity And Be Better Equipped to Fight Coronavirus, Flu, Etc.","Since a strong immune system is essential for enabling your body to fight infections, here are some promising natural protection strategies, according to nutritional experts:
Vitamin C
In an article titled “Coronavirus: Exploring Effective Nutritional Treatments,” written by Andrew W. Saul for the Orthomolecular News Service, he analyzed data gleaned from over 30 clinical studies to verify the antiviral power of vitamin C against different flu viruses spanning several decades.

Saul found that vitamin C inactivates the virus and boosts immunity to continue suppressing the virus. Many cases showed that oral supplementation of at least 10,000 mg of vitamin C daily offered protective benefits. But when dealing with stronger viruses, one may require larger doses given intravenously, such as 100,000 to 150,000 mg of vitamin C daily.
Vitamin C helps your body produce the antioxidant glutathione, as well as an antiviral called interferon.
In cases where IV vitamin C is unavailable, individuals gradually increased their oral dose up to 50,000 mg daily before reaching bowel tolerance. Most people are able to consume five grams (5,000 mg) of powdered or crystal forms of high-quality ascorbic acid at a time every four hours, to the tolerance of their digestive tract.
Andrew Saul writes, “Every virus seems to respond to this type of treatment, regardless of the whether it is SARs, Bird flu, Swine flu or the new Coronavirus flu.”
(Related: Clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C treatments for coronavirus commence in China.)
Vitamin D3
In a study from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled study where they gave the treatment group 1,200 IU (international units) of vitamin D3 during the cold and flu season. The control group received a placebo.
The participants in the vitamin D group had a 58 percent reduced risk of flu.
Vitamin D3 is a natural treatment for flu infections and it allows your body to create cathelicidin, an antibiotic protein that eliminates bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses.
Vitamin D levels of 30 to 50 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) in your blood are believed to be enough, but research has found that levels of about 50 to 100 ng/mL are essential to prevent infection.
You can get vitamin D by following a healthy diet full of food sources of vitamin D, and through exposure to sunlight. However, it is essential to take supplements during the winter season. Consider 5,000 to 10,000 IU daily, or follow the instructions of your naturopathic physician.
If you already have the flu, your physician may recommend you take 50,000 IU daily for the first five days, then take 5,000 to 10,000 IU as a maintenance dose, but this depends entirely on your current blood levels, so get your blood tested by a competent clinical practitioner first.
Silver
According to a study from the Journal of Nanotechnology, silver nanoparticles kill HIV-1 and most kinds of viruses. Researchers who conducted the study incubated HIV-1 virus at 37 C and results revealed that silver particles killed 100 percent of the virus after only three hours.
Silver binds to the DNA of the virus cell, which prevents it from multiplying.
Silver prevents a virus from transferring from one person to another by hindering its ability to find a host cell to feed on. Without a host, viruses can’t survive.
Use colloidal silver at doses of 10 to 20 ppm (parts per million) to prevent infections. It is best to use nanoparticle silver.
Anti-viral foods
Aside from taking vitamins C and D and colloidal silver, eating anti-viral foods is one of the best ways to protect yourself against infectious diseases.
The foods below offer strong anti-viral properties.
Cilantro
Coconut oil
Fennel
Garlic
Ginger
Kale
Parsley
Pomegranates
Red clover
Sprouts
Sweet potatoes
Turmeric
Wild blueberries
Exercise regularly to maintain your physical health and wash your hands thoroughly to maintain proper hygiene. Follow a balanced diet and take supplements to boost your immune system and protect yourself against the dreaded coronavirus.

 Is the Coronavirus an Act of the Deep State?,"We’ve all heard the axiom… “never say never”. It seems in this 21st century, more-often-than-not, we find ourselves in disbelief of something that has been either said or been done.
So, when I suggest to you that the Deep State may be behind this virus called COVID-19, we just can’t dismiss the thought as impossible.
Would we have ever imagined that we’d see a duly elected president be taken through the grinder of political BS that this one has?

From the day he won, nearly every Democrat holding office swore they would take him down. With the mainstream media lap dogs leading the way, they, the DC Swamp Creatures, have done everything in their power to hurt this man and his family.
This doesn’t account for the” Dark Side”, the much more sinister, evil, and more powerful organizations around the globe which are now referred to as the “Deep State”.
My previous essay will help educate on who these people are – Secret Societies and the Who’s Who Behind the Drive to Destroy Trump and America.
The Deep State has done almost everything in their power to reach their goals of a one global government along with a one global economy.
In that dark world, we would all succumb to the United Nations dictators who would rule the globe.
Unfortunately for them Donald J. Trump stepped in their way, and they are not happy about it. Four more years of President Trump would most definitely infringe on their 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Growth.
One of the organizations the world is turning to for help around COVID-19 is the WHO, World Health Organization, which is a specialized agency of the United Nations headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.
Considering that the United Nations is part of the Deep State, who’s to say that the evil which lies within, would not perhaps create a way to make citizens of all countries around the globe perceive them as saviors, were they to find a vaccine for the Coronavirus?
Yes, I am suggesting that the Deep State may have created and planted this virus around the world. Then, when just enough people have died from the virus, they will miraculously come up with a cure.
Doctor Marc Siegel, a Fox News medical correspondent, criticized the World Health Organization as a “bunch of alarmists”, for raising their assessment of the global coronavirus risk from “high” to “very high.”
A very high global risk assessment is the most serious assessment in the WHO’s new four-stage alert system.
Dr. Siegel went on to say, “they always overstate the problem and they always make it seem like the world is going to end.”
The movie “V for Vendetta”, starring Natalie Portman, is a realistic picture of what governments are capable of.
The movie is based in a futuristic London, a police state occupied by a fascist government, creates one disaster after another, to which the government then steps in, resolving the issue.
It’s citizens, although having no love for the government, look at their leaders as their saviors, who are always there to do just that, save them. This is what socialist governments do, make their citizens dependent on the government.
What better way to take President Trump down, then by creating what appears to be a natural disaster, one to which he cannot recover from?
A stock market that drops thousands of points in one week, along with the liberal media lap dogs, all barking the same narrative, Trump failed again and has no concept of how to save us.
Air travel around the globe could be suspended, killing one of the world’s largest industries, along with millions of jobs.
They’re already claiming, “If things keep going like this, we will be in a recession.”
You can bet your bottom dollar; the Socialist Democrats want all of that to become reality and will blame it all on Trump.
Here’s a little more incentive for the United Nations and the Deep State’s need to get rid of President Trump. Under Trump’s Administration, U.S. funding for the UN has been cut dramatically.
And did I mention the level of distain the UN has for our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel?
Until President Trump came along, we have been the chief funder of a swollen, unaccountable U.N. apparatus that has been a gross disappointment for more than 70 years.
Keep in mind, absolute power creates absolute corruption…. remember the axiom “never say never”.

 Sen. Tom Cotton: China Refusing to Hand Over Evidence About Wuhan BioLab,"Senator Tom Cotton says that China is refusing to hand over evidence concerning the bio-safety level 4 research lab in Wuhan despite a new report from biological scientists at the South China University of Technology saying it may have been the source of the coronavirus outbreak.
During an appearance on Fox News, Cotton told Maria Bartiromo that new evidence confirmed the source of the virus was not the meat market in Wuhan.

“Here is what we do know. This virus did not originate in the Wuhan animal market,” said Cotton.
“Epidemiologists who are widely respected from China published a study in the international journal Lancet have demonstrated that several of the original cases did NOT have any contact with that food market.
“The virus went into that food market before it came out of that food market. So we don’t know where it originated… We also know that only a few miles away from that market is China’s only bio-safety Level Four Super Laboratory that researches human infectious diseases.”
Cotton said that China’s “duplicity and dishonesty” meant that questions needed to be asked about the lab but that “China right now is not giving any evidence on that question at all” and Beijing was being “very secretive” on what happens at the lab.
Cotton also accused China of consistently blocking American scientists from traveling to Wuhan to assist in discovering the origins of the virus.

A new report by scientists at the South China University of Technology in Guangzhou, China concludes that “the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.”
One of the laboratories named in the report which was conducting research on bat coronavirus was located just 280 meters from the site of the Wuhan meat market.
For weeks, the media has demonized anyone who suggested the lab could have been responsible for the coronavirus outbreak as a dangerous conspiracy theorist peddling fake news.
However, now that CNN/NY Times journalist Ezra Cheung tweeted precisely that yesterday, one wonders whether they will begin to change their tune.

" 5G Rollout Speeds Up Despite Pandemic, Gov’ts Banning It, Issuing Moratoriums, Lawsuits, Warnings, etc.","Many cities, countries, and organizations have taken action against the 5G rollout including banning it, filing lawsuits and issuing moratoriums (see 1, 2, 3, 4).  Since 2018 people and animals have been getting sick where it has been turned on (see 1, 2, 3, 4).
Worldwide opposition includes a multitude of catastrophic warnings (see 1, 2, 3, 4) in addition to health risks from exposure which include reduced immunity to illness and cancer.
Even though the coronavirus pandemic has literally caused countries to shut themselves down – this hasn’t stopped the “Race to 5G”.  In fact – the pandemic is actually accelerating it.

Thanks to Technocracy News & Trends for providing explanation why:
5G carriers claim that the coronavirus pandemic has actually increased demand for wireless bandwidth and thus make it ever more important to quickly rollout 5G towers around the nation to increase wireless capacity. – TN Editor
In March 2020 everything that could be moved online already has, from elementary schools to college classes, from entire company workforces to shareholder meetings. Whole cities have emptied under the coronavirus threat as businesses tell employees to work from home,  students are sent indoors to learn online and every type of entertainment — from restaurants and sporting venues to movie theaters — shutters, forcing people to stay home and rely on their home broadband networks to interact with the outside world.
This switch-over is unprecedented, which begs the question: Can our current networks handle the strain?
Moreover, is the coronavirus outbreak and the “social distancing″ required to mitigate the spread going to become the business case for more advanced and robust 5G technologies for a future in which business, health care and human interaction must be at more than an arm’s length?
Read full story here…
In February 2019 the telecom industry admitted that they don’t even have scientific evidence that 5G is safe.  Yet many of the powers-that-be still insist that humanity desperately needs this technology.  So this desperate need even includes launching satellites to blast it from space. Wack-a-doodle doo.

 Virologist Who Visited Wuhan Says Coronavirus is “Out of Control”,"A top virologist who was involved in the response to SARS says he has visited Wuhan, China and believes that the coronavirus is “out of control.”
Dr. Guan, the director of the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infections Diseases at the University of Hong Kong, told the Globe and Mail, “I’ve experienced so much and I’ve never felt scared before, but this time I’m scared.”
Guan also warned that the scale of the infection may be “10 times higher than SARS” and left Wuhan fearing that “the epidemic situation was out of control.”

The doctor warned that quarantine measures imposed by authorities may not go far enough.
“When these people returned to their hometowns, they took the virus to all parts of the country,” he said.
Yesterday we highlighted video footage out of Wuhan that showed victims of the virus collapsing on the streets.
20 million Chinese citizens are now under quarantine across 13 cities due to the outbreak.
There have been 830 confirmed cases of the virus within China with further cases confirmed in Thailand, the US, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and Singapore.
The virus has claimed 26 lives so far, mostly elderly people with existing illnesses.
As we highlighted yesterday, a biosafety level 4 laboratory that studies the “world’s most dangerous pathogens” is based in Wuhan, leading some to speculate whether the virus was accidentally released.
However, officials say the source of the outbreak was an illegal animal market in Wuhan which sold bats and snakes.
Video footage of Chinese people eating bat soup highlighted the link. Reportedly, bat soup is a local delicacy in Wuhan.

 Facts Behind the Coronavirus Outbreak – It Could Have Been Stopped!,"… Had the Chinese authorities had acted three-weeks earlier — the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by 95% and its worldwide geographic spread limited.
Unfortunately, China’s negative reaction, refusal of assistance and deliberate and intentional effort to cover-up the crisis and the subsequent delay in accepting assistance of critical capabilities and help in taking necessary measures to contain the virus lasted about three weeks.
This was totally reprehensible on the part of President Xi and the Chinese Government.


Bottom line – China’s cover-up and the subsequent delay to take serious measures to contain the virus, lasted at least three weeks which helped fuel the pandemic.
The news organization Axios Media has compiled a timeline of the earliest weeks of the Coronavirus outbreak in China. *I will note that as a source, Axios has a ‘left of center’ political bias that favors the Left.
The Axios timeline highlights when China’s cover-up started and ended — and showing how, during that time, the virus already started spreading throughout the world, including to the United States.
According to Axios, the timeline was compiled from information reported by the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, the South China Morning Post, and other international sources.
The chart / timeline back-up the intent of President Trump and the critical events leading up to current situation.
Dec. 10: Wei Guixian, one of the earliest known coronavirus patients, starts feeling ill.
Dec. 16: Patient admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital with infection in both lungs but resistant to anti-flu drugs. Staff later learned he worked at a wildlife market connected to the outbreak.
Dec. 27: Wuhan health officials are told that a new coronavirus is causing the illness.
Dec. 30: Ai Fen, a top director at Wuhan Central Hospital, posts information on WeChat about the new virus. She was reprimanded for doing so and told not to spread information about it.
Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang also shares information on WeChat about the new SARS-like virus. He is called in for questioning shortly afterward.
Wuhan health commission notifies hospitals of a “pneumonia of unclear cause” and orders them to report any related information.
Dec. 31: Wuhan health officials confirm 27 cases of illness and close a market they think is related to the virus’ spread.
China tells the World Health Organization’s China office about the cases of an unknown illness.
Jan. 1: Wuhan Public Security Bureau brings in for questioning eight doctors who had posted information about the illness on WeChat.
An official at the Hubei Provincial Health Commission orders labs, which had already determined that the novel virus was similar to SARS, to stop testing samples and to destroy existing samples.
Jan. 2: Chinese researchers map the new coronavirus’ complete genetic information. This information is not made public until Jan. 9.
Jan. 7: Xi Jinping becomes involved in the response.
Jan. 9: China announces it has mapped the coronavirus genome.
Jan. 11–17: Important prescheduled CCP meeting held in Wuhan. During that time, the Wuhan Health Commission insists there are no new cases.
Jan. 13: First coronavirus case reported in Thailand, the first known case outside China.
Jan. 14: WHO announces Chinese authorities have seen “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus.”
Jan. 15: The patient who becomes the first confirmed U.S. case leaves Wuhan and arrives in the U.S., carrying the coronavirus.
Jan. 18: The Wuhan Health Commission announces four new cases. Annual Wuhan Lunar New Year banquet. Tens of thousands of people gathered for a potluck.
Jan. 19: Beijing sends epidemiologists to Wuhan.
Jan. 20: The first case announced in South Korea.
Zhong Nanshan, a top Chinese doctor who is helping to coordinate the coronavirus response, announces the virus can be passed between people.
Jan. 21: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms the first coronavirus case in the United States.
CCP flagship newspaper People’s Daily mentions the coronavirus epidemic and Xi’s actions to fight it for the first time.
China’s top political commission in charge of law and order warns that “anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of [virus] cases out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity.”
Jan. 23: Wuhan and three other cities are put on lockdown. Right around this time, approximately 5 million people leave the city without being screened for the illness.
Jan. 24–30: China celebrates the Lunar New Year holiday. Hundreds of millions of people are in transit around the country as they visit relatives.
Jan. 24: China extends the lockdown to cover 36 million people and starts to rapidly build a new hospital in Wuhan. From this point, very strict measures continue to be implemented around the country for the rest of the epidemic.
The bottom line: China is now trying to create a narrative that it’s an example of how to handle this crisis when in fact its early actions led to the virus spreading around the globe.

 Debt Forgiveness and Nationalization Are the Answers to the Economic Crisis,"The US airline companies have bankrupted themselves by buying back their stock in an enrichment scheme for CEOs and board members.
With the impact of the virus on their revenues, Congress is handing them a $50 billion bailout. Instead of being bailed out they should be nationalized.
In the health and economic crisis in which we find ourselves, the government is going to need all the public trust it can get. Bailouts of those who caused their problems and ours won’t meet the fairness test.

As I previously wrote, nationalization is a four-letter word for many, but it actually offers a chance to correct for the decades of deregulation and concentration and thereby restore competition to the economy.
Nationalized banks too-big-to-fail, for example, can later be broken up and the pieces sold back into private hands. Commercial banks can again be separated from investment banks, and concentrated financial power can be broken.
Now that we know that markets are not self-regulating, we can restore sensible financial regulation and require banks to lend for productive purposes, not for financializing and leveraging existing assets. The US financial system has not served the productive side of the US economy for a long time.
While ordinary heavily indebted Americans are losing their jobs right and left as businesses close, shopping center lobbyists are asking for a $1 trillion guarantee. The hotel industry wants $150 billion. The restaurant industry wants $145 billion. The National Association of Manufacturers wants $1.4 trillion.
Food service distributors are in trouble. Boeing wants $60 billion funded in part by loan guarantees. Local and state governments need support. The US conference of mayors wants $250 billion. The list is endless.
And what is to be done for the 40% of Americans who, according to a Federal Reserve study, cannot raise $400 in cash without selling personal property? How are the large number of uninsured going to be cared for during this health crisis? Where will hospitals and medical practices get the money?
The only solution is to nationalize health care so that the bills can be paid. We cannot survive large numbers of infected and jobless people roaming the streets raiding for food and whatever they can take.
The only solution for the economy is debt forgiveness for the ordinary people and nationalization for the companies. Trump indicated that aid might be given in the form of an equity stake, and later sell the government’s stake for a profit in a privatization when things return to normal. This would be a partial nationalization. Much better to go whole hog as it allows a cure for concentration and deregulation.
The pandemic has made it clear that a society of self-seeking individuals is not a society. A society is a social system. A successful social system is one that can support its members. Once a self-sustaining social system exists, then there is a basis for people to branch out on their own. But without a sustainable social system, there can be nothing.
To create a sustainable society in the United States requires the abandonment of dogmatic ways of thinking. Old ideologies are in the way. We and our leaders must think creatively if we are to successfully deal with the health and economic crisis.

 Watch Wuhan Residents Shouting “It’s All Fake” From Their Apartment Windows During Official Visit,"A top Chinese official has been heckled by residents as she inspected the work of a neighbourhood committee tasked with taking care of residents quarantined because of coronavirus.
Vice-premier Sun Chunlan toured a residential community in the Qingshan district of Wuhan on Thursday while residents shouted ‘fake, fake’ as well as ‘it’s all fake’ and ‘we protest’ from their apartment windows.
Since 12 February, all residential compounds in Wuhan have been put under lockdown, barring most residents from leaving their homes.

Below, I have included the first rows of comments on YouTube:

 There’s A Connection Between Coronavirus and 5G,"The China Coronavirus 5G Connection is a very important factor when trying to comprehend the coronavirus (formerly abbreviated 2019-nCoV, now COVID-19) outbreak.
Various independent researchers around the web, for around 2-3 weeks now, have highlighted the coronavirus-5G link despite the fact that Google (as the self-appointed NWO Censor-in-Chief) is doing its best to hide and scrub all search results showing the connection.
The coronavirus 5G connection doesn’t mean the bioweapons connection is false (it’s not a case of either-or), but rather broadens the scope of the entire event. Wuhan was one of the test cities chosen for China 5G rollout; 5G went live there on October 31st, 2019, almost exactly 2 months before the coronavirus outbreak began.
The coronavirus 5G connection goes very deep, getting into NWO agendas such as mandatory vaccines, depopulation and transhumanism via DNA vaccines. Image credit: David Dees
Meanwhile, many scientific documents on the health effects of 5G have verified that it causes flu-like symptoms. This article reveals the various connections behind the coronavirus phenomenon, including how 5G can exacerbate or cause the kind of illness you are attributing to the new virus. The rabbit hole is deep so let’s take a dive.
5G – A Type of Directed Energy Weapon
For the deeper background to 5G, read my 2017 article 5G and IoT: Total Technological Control Grid Being Rolled Out Fast. Many people around the world, including concerned citizens, scientist and even governmental officials, are becoming aware of the danger of 5G.
This is why it has already been banned in many places worldwide, such as Brussels, the Netherlands and parts of Switzerland, Ireland, Italy, Germany, the UK, the USA and Australia.
After all, 5G is not just the next generation of mobile connectivity after 4G; it is a radical and entirely new type of technology – a military technology used on the battlefield that is now being ‘deployed’ (military term) in the civilian realm.
It is phased array weaponry being sold and disguised as primarily a communications system when the frequency bands it uses (24GHz – 100+GHz including MMW [millimeter waves]) are the very same ones used in Active Denial Systems, i.e. crowd control.
Even mainstream Wikipedia describes Active Denial Systems as directed energy weaponry; it disperses crowds by firing energy at them, causing immediate and intense pain, including a sensation of the skin burning.
Remember, directed energy weapons (DEW) are behind the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11 and the fake Californian ‘wildfires’.
Image source: RadiationDangers.com — You can learn more on the subject by reading the book “The Dark Side of Prenatal Ultrasound“.
Numerous scientists have warned of the dangerous health effects of 5G. For instance, in this 5G Appeal from 2017 entitled Scientists and Doctors Warn of Potential Serious Health Effects of 5G, scientists warned of the harmful of non-ionizing RF/EMF radiation:
“Effects include increased cancer risk, cellular stress, increase in harmful free radicals, genetic damages, structural and functional changes of the reproductive system, learning and memory deficits, neurological disorders, and negative impacts on general wellbeing in humans. Damage goes well beyond the human race, as there is growing evidence of harmful effects to both plants and animals.”
If you listen to Mark Steele and Barrie Trower, you’ll get an idea of the horrifying effects of 5G. In this interview, Trower echoes the above quote by stating how 5G damages the immune system of trees and kills insects.
He reveals how in 1977, 5G was tested on animals in hopes of finding a weapon. The results were severe demyelination – stripping the protective sheath of nerve cells. Some nations are now noticing a 90% loss of insects (including pollinating insects like bees) which congregate around lamp-posts where 5G is installed.
Wuhan Military Games and Event 201 Simulation
If you dig deep enough, some disturbing connections arise between 5G and the men who have developed or are developing vaccines for novel viruses like ebola, zika and the new coronavirus COVID-19.
In a fantastic piece of research, an author under the pen name of Annie Logical wrote the article Corona Virus Fakery And The Link To 5G Testing that lays out the coronavirus 5G connection. There is a ton of information, so I will break it all down to make it more understandable.
From October 18-27th 2019, Wuhan hosted the Military World Games and specifically used 5G (for the first time ever) for the event. Also on October 18th, 2019 in New York, the Johns Hopkins Center in partnership with World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201 – “A Global Pandemic Exercise” which is a simulation of a pandemic.

Guess what virus they happen to choose for their ‘simulation’? A coronavirus! Guess what animal cells they use? Pig cells!
(COVID-19 was initially reported to be derived from a seafood market, and the fish there are known to be fed on pig waste).
Event 201 includes the UN (since the WEF now has a partnership agreement with UN), Big Pharma (Johnson and Johnson), Bill Gates (key figure in pushing vaccines, human microchipping and Agenda 2030) and both China and America’s CDC.
Participants in Event 201 recommended that governments force social media companies to stop the spread of ‘fake news’ and that ultimately the only way to control the information would be for the WHO (World Health Organization, part of the UN) to be the sole central purveyor of information during a pandemic.
Inovio, Electroporation and 5G
As reported on January 24th, 2020, US biotech and pharmaceutical company Inovio received a $9 million grant to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus. Inovio got the money grant from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), however they already have an existing partnership with CEPI; in April 2018 they got up to $56 million to develop vaccines for Lassa Fever and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
CEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India, the Wellcome Trust … and the participants of Event 201: the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the WEF. CEPI’s CEO is the former director of BARDA (US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) which is part of the HHS.
Inovio claimed they developed a coronavirus vaccine in 2 hours! On the face of it such a claim is absurd; what is more likely is that they are lying or that they already had the vaccine because they had the foreknowledge that the coronavirus was coming and was about to be unleashed.
So who owns and runs Inovio? Two key men are David Weiner and Dr. Joseph Kim. Weiner was once Kim’s university professor. Weiner was involved with developing a vaccine for HIV and zika (you can read my articles about zika here and here where I exposed some of the lies surrounding that epidemic).
Kim was funded by Merck (a large Big Pharma company) and produced something called Porcine Circovirus (PCV 1 and PCV 2). As mentioned above, there is a link between pig vaccines/pig DNA and the coronavirus; Annie Logical notes that it “has long been established that seafood in the area is fed on pig waste.”
Kim served a 5-year tenure as a member of the WEF’s Global Agenda Council – yet another organ pushing the New World Order One World Government under the banner of Agenda 2030 Global Governance.
Weiner is an employee and advisor to the FDA, is considered a DNA technology expert and pioneered a new DNA transference method called electroporation – a microbiology technique which uses an electrical pulse to create temporary pores in cell membranes through which substances like chemicals, drugs or DNA can be introduced into the cell.
This technique can be used to administer DNA vaccines, which inject foreign DNA into a host’s cells that changes the host’s DNA. This means if you take a DNA vaccine, you are allowing your DNA to be changed!
As if vaccines weren’t already horrific enough … but here’s the kicker: electroporation uses pulsed waves. Guess what else uses pulsed waves? 5G! This is either a startling coincidence or evidence or a sinister coronavirus 5G-connection. Annie writes:
“[T]he same action that 5G technology uses in pulsed waves and the coronavirus was reported to have started in an area in China that had rolled out 5G technology!
“So we can see how geneticists using scientists are tampering with the building blocks of our existence and what is disturbing is that Prof Wiener is a HIV pioneer and we know that soon after the Polio vaccines were given to millions in Africa that HIV emerged. They have perfected the art of injecting animal or bird DNA into human chromosomes which alters our DNA and causes things like haemorrhaging, fever, cancers and even death.”

Speaking of HIV (which is not the same things as AIDS, but that is another story), remember also that a group of Indian scientists put out their research that the virus was manmade and had HIV inserts.
They found that 4 separate HIV genes were randomly embedded within the coronavirus. These genes somehow converged to create receptor sites on the virus that were identical to HIV, which was a surprise due to their random placement.
They also specifically stated that this was not likely to happen naturally (“unlikely to be fortuitous in nature”). In yet another example of egregious censorship, these scientists were pressured to withdraw their work.
5G and Electroporation DNA Vaccines – Both Producing Pulsed EMF Waves
Consider the implications of this for a moment. The technology exists to use EMFs to open your very skin pores and inject foreign DNA into your bloodstream and cells.
This is an extreme violation of your bodily sovereignty, and it can have long-term effects, because of genetic mutation – changing your very DNA which is the biological blueprint and physical essence of who you are.
What if 5G mimics electroporation? What if 5G can do on a large scale what electroporation does on a small scale? We already know that 5G has the potential to be mutagenic (DNA-damaging).
The frequencies that 5G uses, especially 75-100GHz, interact with the geometrical structure of our skin and sweat ducts, acting upon them like a transmission reaching an antenna, and fundamentally affecting us and our mood.
What if 5G is being used to open up the skin of those in Wuhan so as to allow the new bioweapon coronavirus to infiltrate more easily?
Mandatory Vaccines, Depopulation and Transhumanism
So, what’s at the bottom of the coronavirus-5G connection rabbit hole? I would suggest we find mandatory vaccine agenda, the depopulation agenda and transhumanist agenda (via DNA vaccines).
The key figures and groups who appear to have planned this already have the vaccine in place, just as they did for the other epidemics that fizzled out (SARS, ebola and zika). Weiner even has links to HIV/AIDS, and if you dive into that as Jon Rappoport did, you find gaping holes in that story.
It’s the same epidemic / pandemic game played out every 2-3 years. There’s a couple of versions.
In the first version, you invent a virus, hype it up, get people scared, do ineffectual and inconclusive tests (e.g. like the PCR test which measures if a viral fragment is present but doesn’t tell you the quantities of whether it would actually causing the disease), inflate the body count, justify quarantine/martial law and brainwash people into thinking they have to buy the (toxic) vaccine and introduce mandatory vaccination. You don’t even need a real virus or pathogen for the version.
In the second version, you create a virus as a bioweapon, release it as a test, pretend it was a natural mutation, watch how many people it kills (which helps with the eugenics and depopulation agendas), again justify martial law, again justify the need for mandatory vaccines and even pose as the savior with the vaccine that stops it.
As a variation on this second version, you can even develop a race-specific bioweapon so as to reduce the population of rival nations or enemy races as a geopolitical strategy.
This article suggests that the coronavirus targets Chinese people / Asians more than others, and certainly the official death count attests to that, although it’s always hard to trust governmental statistics. Annie Logical gives her take:
“The con job goes like this.
Step 1) poison the population purposely to create disease that does not and would never occur naturally
Step 2) parlay the purposely created disease as being caused by something invisible, outside the realm of control or knowledge of the average person
Step 3) create a toxic vaccine or medication that was always intended to further poison the population into an early grave
Step 4) parlay the vaccine or medication poisoning as PROOF the disease, which never existed, is much worse than anticipated
Step 5) increase the initial poisoning, which is marketed as a fake disease, and also increase the vaccine and medication poisoning, to start piling the bodies into the stratosphere
Step 6) repeat as many times as possible upon an uninformed population because killing a population this way (the art of having people line up to kill themselves with poison……known as a “soft kill” method) is the only legal way to make sure such eugenic operations can be executed on mass and in plain sight.“
DNA vaccines are a disturbing new advancement for transhumanism. After all, the objective of the transhumanist agenda is to merge man with machine, and in doing so, wipe out what fundamentally makes us human, so we can be controlled and overtaken by a deeply sinister and negative force.
It’s all about changing us at the fundamental level, or attacking human sovereignty itself. DNA vaccines fit right in with that – literally changing your DNA by forcefully inserting foreign DNA to change your genetics, with consequences no one could possibly fully foresee and predict.
One Last Coronavirus – 5G Connection
Finally, I will finish with another coronavirus-5G connection. The word coronavirus itself refers to many kinds of viruses by that name, not just COVID-19.
Guess who owns a patent for a coronavirus strain that can be used to develop a vaccine? The Pirbright Institute. And guess who partially owns them? Bill Gates! 
As you can read here Pirbright is being supported in their vaccine developement endeavors by a British company Innovate UK … who also funds and supports the rollout of 5G. Innovate UK ran a competition in 2018 with a £15 million share out to any small business that could produce vaccines for ‘epidemic’ potential.

The Motivation to Hype and the Motivation to Downplay
History has shown that in cases of epidemics (or fake epidemics) there is almost always a morass of conflicting reports and contradictory information. In such situations, it can be very difficult to get to the bottom of the matter and find the truth. The conflict stems from the different motivations of nations, governments and other interested groups.
Essentially, there are 2 main motivations: the motivation to hype (exaggerate and use fear to grab attention, sell something, make a group look bad/incompetent, make people scared, make the public accept mandatory vaccination and martial law) and the motivation to downplay (cover up and hide the true extent of the damage, morbidity or mortality so as to appear competent and in control, to lessen possible anger, backlash or disorder).
Sometimes, these 2 motivations may drive the behavior of the same group, e.g. in the case of the Chinese Government, it has the motivation to hype (to get people afraid so they easily follow its draconian quarantine rules) and the motivation to downplay (so as to appear in the eyes of its people and the rest of the entire world to have the situation under control, to ensure saving face, credibility and a good reputation).
Final Thoughts on the Coronavirus 5G Connection
Governments around the world have experimented with bioweapons both on their own citizens and foreign citizens, and even sold that research to other governments for their own benefit (e.g. Japan’s notorious Unit 731 which developed bioweapons in China, only to hand over that research to the US after losing World War 2).
See Bioweapons: Lyme Disease, Weaponized Ticks, Plum Island & More for a brief history of the USG’s usage of weaponized ticks which resulted in Lyme Disease.
The evidence that COVID-19 is a bioweapon is overwhelming – and so is the evidence that 5G is involved to either cause the flu-like symptoms/pneumonia people have been experiencing, and/or to exacerbate the virulity of the virus by weakening people’s immune systems and subjecting them to pulsed waves of EMF to open up their skin to foreign DNA fragments (including viruses).
In this kinds of story, there are no major coincidences – only connections and conspiracies waiting to be uncovered.

 How Many People REALLY Have Coronavirus?,"Note: this article contains several major points. I could have written it as four or five separate pieces. But because the points are related, they’re under one roof here. I ask serious readers to dig in.
The other day, I was in a UPS store, and a customer was paying for a large box he was sending to Florida. I asked him what was in the box.
He said, “Toilet paper.”
The new economy.

The majority of the people stripping items off store shelves know nothing about the virus, and if they did, they wouldn’t care. They’re acting like frothing marauders because other people are, too.
“I’ve got to get paper towels and pet food because everyone else is hoarding them.” Now there’s REAL contagion.
The corollary: If no one were hoarding, store shelves would be adequately stocked, and shopping would be a relatively calm affair.
Quarantines, lockdowns, the advice to maintain “social distancing,” and wall-to-wall propaganda about “transmission of the virus” have resulted in mass cancelation of public events and the shuttering of large venues.
Untold numbers of small businesses are in serious trouble. This is a direct attack on the economy.
It is also a ripping of the right to “peaceably assemble,” one of the natural freedoms embodied in the 1st Amendment to the Constitution.
As usual, “the threat to public safety and health” is invoked to override freedoms and rights.
You would think the public sees through this tired excuse for dictatorial control, but it is not the case. Parental government as a concept and a practice has invaded minds.
“Well, sure, they’re taking care of us.” If you believe that, I have condos for sale on the far side of the moon.
At another level, quarantines serve to enforce the idea that all people are medical patients for their whole lives — and, therefore, they must follow medical orders. Get tested, diagnosed, drugged, vaccinated. For what? For all possible diseases and infections.
As far as the coronavirus is concerned, forget about contagion and transmission for the moment. What about the widespread diagnostic test for the virus in humans? Is this PCR test accurate? Is it useful?
I keep coming back to the issue, because the whole designation of a “coronavirus case,” if it means anything at all, depends on the veracity of the test — not in a lab or a medical journal, but in life, in the world.
I repeat what I wrote in a recent article: Outside of China, the most widely used test is called the PCR. It must be done with tremendous care, because contamination with irrelevant microbes and cellular material can yield a misleading and absurd result.
The PCR, it is claimed, can take a tiny, tiny bit of material from a patient and blow it up many times, so it can be identified. “This is the coronavirus. This patient is infected.”
Not only that, the test’s proponents assert that, quite easily, the PCR can also determine the AMOUNT of virus in the patient’s body. Why is that vitally important?
Because, to even begin talking about the patient ever getting sick, he must have millions and millions of coronavirus actively replicating in his body.
There are people (and I’m one of them) who challenge the claim that the PCR can show how much virus is in the patient’s body. The experts try to brush us off — we don’t understand the intricacies of the test, it’s highly technical, we’re not qualified to make a judgment, etc..
I’ve been searching for a way around this futile argument. In the process, I’ve discovered something important about the PCR. I SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT THE ACCURACY OF THE TEST HAS EVER BEEN PROVEN.
Let me explain. You bring your car to a good repair shop. The mechanics hook it up to a device and run a test to diagnose what’s causing the car to stall. Who says their tests are accurate?
At some point in the past, these diagnostic procedures have been vetted, to make sure they work properly.
And sure enough, when the mechanics say, “We’ve found the problem,” and when they correct that problem, you drive the car and it doesn’t stall anymore. This is called a real-life result.
This is not the situation re the PCR. Its proponents claim it can count how much virus is in a patient’s body — how much of a particular virus.
But where is the proof, in real-life terms, that the PCR can do that? How was that proof ever established?
When I say proof, I don’t mean technical mumbo-jumbo. I’m not referring to the highly dense language these scientists use among themselves. I’m talking about real live human patients, and results.
After all, if the PCR is being used to diagnose people, and if the results are being used to count the number of coronavirus cases in various countries, and if the number of cases forms the basis for, say, locking down the whole of Italy in a mass quarantine… THE TEST IS IMPORTANT, WOULDN’T YOU SAY?
I have seen no wide-ranging proof that the PCR was ever checked properly, when it was first introduced, to show it could do what researchers say it can do.
WHO TESTED THE TEST?
I have come up with a process — a simple process — which will check the veracity of the PCR. It should have been carried out decades ago. The fact that it wasn’t is an enormous scandal.
Here it is.
From a hundred patients, very small tissue samples are taken. The PCR lab people don’t take the samples. They don’t ever see the patients or know who they are.
The lab professionals run these hundred samples through the PCR, obtain results, and then report: what virus did they find in each case, and how much of that virus did they find?
Let’s say, in six instances, the lab techs claim they found a great amount of virus in the patients.
Well, those patients should be sick.
Are they? ARE THEY?
“We’ve determined that patients 4, 9, 32, 54, 65, and 86 all have a huge amount of virus in their bodies.”
“Interesting. Thanks. Let’s see. Hmm. Turns out these people are fit as a fiddle. Not sick. I guess your test didn’t work. It’s a flop.”
Or maybe the test does work. The six patients are sick. LET’S FIND OUT. IN THE WORLD, NOT IN JOURNALS.
That’s what I mean by real-life results. No jive, no tap dancing.
There is more. This experiment with the hundred patients? It should be done, not just once, but many times. A hundred patients here at this facility, a hundred patients there at that facility.
Thirty or forty different facilities, and thirty or forty different sets of a hundred patients. It should be done by independent scientists without conflicts of interest.
It should have been done decades ago. I see no evidence that it was.
THE TEST WAS NEVER PROPERLY TESTED. A GIANT SCANDAL.
Think about what that means.
Now let’s go to China, where we’re told the majority of people who “have the virus” reside. What diagnostic test are they using there? CT scans of the lungs. Looking for what? Pneumonia. Why? Because it’s being called the number one symptom of coronavirus infection.
They’re kidding, right?
Unfortunately, no.
Well, pneumonia has many causes, none of which needs the presence of a coronavirus. That’s number one.
Number two, roughly 300,000 people in China die of pneumonia every year — long before the supposed coronavirus emerged. 
And number three, in the city of Wuhan, where the “epidemic” supposedly started, the air quality is horrific.
Last summer, protests on the streets of Wuhan attested to citizen outrage at the problem. And, breaking news: disastrous air quality can cause pneumonia — no germs of any kind necessary.
But of course, we can sweep all these concerns off the table because, well, who cares about the accuracy of tests? If people in Los Angeles are fighting over who gets the last six rolls of toilet paper, that’s all the proof we need: this is a global epidemic caused by a virus. Right?
Finally, I’ll make a few comments concerning the ‘BUT WHAT ABOUT THIS’ PEOPLE. They have endless questions centering on reports of corona cases in this country, that country, this city, that town, another planet, another galaxy. I have answered some of those questions.
There is a basic point covering all the questions:
DO NOT ASSUME THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK IN VARIOUS PLACES ARE ALL SUFFERING FROM THE SAME CAUSE.
You might want to read that statement several times.
Related: There’s A Connection Between Coronavirus And 5G
Since the diagnostic tests for the virus are inaccurate, wrong-headed, and absurd, the LUMPING OF ALL THESE SICK PEOPLE EVERYWHERE UNDER THE SAME LABEL — CORONAVIRUS — IS MEANINGLESS AND DECEPTIVE.
Don’t fall for it. Be smarter than that. Stop trying to use one explanation to account for all supposed cases of the virus.
And furthermore, don’t make the false assumption that all these reported coronavirus cases are the result of NEW disease or never-before-seen disease.
Where people are genuinely ill, many or most of them have the same health conditions that have been affecting humans for a long, long time — now recycled and re-labeled CORONAVIRUS.
I’m giving you insights I gained in 1987 while researching AIDS.
In a nutshell, I took the groups the CDC claimed were at high-risk for AIDS — Haitians, Africans in certain countries, IV street drug users, gay men, hemophiliacs — and found that, for the most part, the groups were suffering from very old diseases and long-standing horrendous environmental conditions. Nothing to do with HIV. And where new illness was present, the causes were mainly chemical toxicity.
“It has to be all coronavirus or all something else.” Wrong. False. Misguided. Baloney. Start over.
I discovered this central con-hustle of the medical cartel 34 years ago, and it applies precisely and across the board, in the current “epidemic.”
For example, for those people researching 5G technology and its harmful health effects, stop stretching your necks trying to prove that 5G has to be THE real and single cause of ALL supposed corona cases.
If you show 5G applies to one or two areas where people are being falsely labeled with the virus, you’ve done a major service. If you can’t prove 5G applies to other areas, that’s not a problem.
We’re looking at multiple factors here. Some people are sick because of X. Others because of Y. Others because of Z. Still others are not sick at all.
But ALL OF THEM are being falsely corralled under the LABEL of coronavirus.
We don’t need to replace one fake label with another single label.
Frankly, to use a technical term, this bullshit needs to stop.
If you’re somewhat puzzled by this article, go back and read it again. Keep doing that until it comes clear.
I say this because, in 1987, I had the same facts in front of me, the same basic facts I ‘ve presented in this article — and it took me three months to realize the implications and see where I’d bought the big con.
The biggest con of all: THIS EPIDEMIC IS ONE THING.
No. It isn’t.

 Iran’s Coronavirus Crisis: Mass Graves So Large They Can Be Seen From Space,"Iran is building so many burial pits that satellite photos were able to detect them. These new satellite images show that the coronavirus outbreak in Iran may either be worse than what government sources are reporting, or they may be preparing for a possible disaster.
In the city of Qom, just 80 miles south of Tehran, there’s a massive cemetery known as the Behesht-e Masoumeh Complex, which lies around six miles north of the city center.
Satellite images from as early as February 21 show that excavation teams have been hard at work creating a new section in the graveyard. By the end of February, two large trenches, around 100 yards in length total, had been dug out — they were so large that they were visible from space.

According to video testimony, official statements as well as analysis from experts, this excavation project wasn’t just a routine expansion of a cemetery, but these fresh graves were dug out to accommodate the country’s near-uncontrollable death toll from the coronavirus pandemic.
The pictures of the new graves were taken on March 1 by Maxar Technologies, a private space technology company based in Colorado.
A senior imagery analyst from Maxar told Vox that “the trenches were made very quickly” and that these new graves mark a clear departure from the country’s past burial practices when it comes to individual and family grave plots.
 ﻿ 
Furthermore, the same Maxar analyst said that they have an image of a large pile of lime right next to the freshly-dug plots. Iranian health officials have previously said that they’re using lime to bury those killed by COVID-19.
A video released by BBC Persia purportedly shows the mass graves in Bahesht-e Masoumeh. In the video, the narrator describes the scenes he’s seeing in the cemetery.
“This is the section for the coronavirus victims,” says the narrator, as the camera pans to a small portion of the trench, showing small, simple markers placed on mounds of dirt and people in blue protective suits standing nearby.
“More than 80 [people] have been buried in this section so far, and they say only 34 deaths.” The man is citing Iran’s official death toll on February 28.
Fabian Hinz, a research associate and geospatial analysis expert for Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, reviewed the video as well as another video that was also supposedly shot on sight, said that “unique geographical markers” in the videos match landmarks found in the massive graveyard.
This provides evidence to support the hypothesis that the trenches at Bahesht-e Masoumeh were made to supply Qom with more burials for coronavirus victims.
Mistrust and mishandling hamper Iran’s efforts to combat outbreak
As of press time, Iran reports having 10,075 cases of coronavirus and 429 deaths. They also reported 75 new deaths over the past 24 hours — the most deaths reported by Iran in a single day.
Listen to the helpless pleas of this healthcare worker from Iran: ""Please take #CoronaVirus seriously. Don't come out of your homes. We healthcare workers are exhausted. We cannot cope with it any longer"".

Reports came in last week that dozens of dead Iranians were being kept in black body bags, unburied, on the floor of a morgue in Qom, meaning that morgues all over the city may be struggling to find space for all of the dead.
This underscores how one of the holiest cities in Shia Islam is struggling to contend with so many deaths in such a short span of time.
Two medical workers in Qom even told reporters that they worry the coronavirus may put an end to traditional Islamic burial practices, which involves washing the body with soap and water before laying it to rest, due to the fears over catching the infection from dead bodies.
Instead, the bodies are being treated with lime so that the coronavirus doesn’t infect the soil. Ali Ramezani, director of Bahesht-e Masoumeh, told a state-run news agency that there was a “pile-up” of bodies at the cemetery.
Fear and confusion as Iranian government officials keel over due to their COVID-19 infections
Iran is currently being criticized for its lack of transparency with regards to the progression of the outbreak in their country. Many experts believe that the real infection rate and death toll are much higher than what the Iranian government reporting.
For example, Mohammad Hossein Ghorbani, a representative for the health ministry of Gilan province, commented that the death toll in the province alone was over 200 — which would represent nearly half of the entire country’s reported deaths.
Over the weekend, the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), a Paris-based political organization made up primarily of Iranian expatriates dedicated to the toppling of the country’s current regime, held an online conference that featured addresses by Iranian nurses, medical practitioners and health experts from 19 different locations.
Their main topic: the beginning and the spread of the coronavirus outbreak in their home country. Some who spoke at the conference put the real death toll at over 2,000.
While the Iranian regime claims the #Coronavirus death toll for the entire country is 194, the Health Minister's Plenipotentiary Representative in Gilan Province says the death toll in Gilan province alone is 200. https://t.co/uPYclIr8NW

“We Iranians are about to lose many of our friends and families to this epidemic,” said Sina Dashti, a member of NCRI and an infectologist residing in Sweden.
“Iranians are fighting with two enemies. One is COVID-19 and the second is the Iranian regime. Transparency is key to fighting epidemics. The regime is preventing news of the epidemic from being broadcast.”

 Update: High Dose Vitamin C Used for 50 Cases of Coronavirus (Moderate to Severe) Successfully Treated in China Hospital,"Dr. Richard Cheng has been updating everyone via his YouTube channel about vitamin C treatment cases out of China.
We have been covering his updates as he is in direct contact with this treatment and isn’t simply an armchair scientist at the moment.
We feel in this time this is a very important detail as he is seeing and hearing results first hand, not simply theoretically.

Dr. Cheng was paramount in bringing high dose vitamin C to the table as part of potential treatment and prevention measures.
Unfortunately in the West, this option is still being denied by much of mainstream media and governments are not talking about it.
Instead, it’s fear and chaos which we do not feel serves anyone to stay healthy or get better. I believe this is a great aspect of this journey to reflect on as it tells us where loyalties lie when it comes to government and pharma.
It also illustrates the power of fear and separation culture as opposed to unity.
A group of medical doctors, healthcare providers and scientists met online March 17, 2020, to discuss the use of high dose intravenous vitamin C (IVC) in the treatment of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 patients.
Dr. Enqian Mao was in attendance, he is the chief of emergency medicine department at Ruijin Hospital, a major hospital in Shanghai, affiliated with the Joatong University College of Medicine.
Dr. Mao is also a member of the Senior Expert Team at the Shanghai Public Health Center, where all Covid-19 patients have been treated.
Dr. Mao stated that his group treated about 50 cases of moderate to severe cases of Covid-19 infection with high dose IVC. Dosing of IVC ranged from 10,000 mg – 20,000 mg a day for 7-10 days, with 10,000 mg for moderate cases and 20,000 for more severe cases.
The first bit of good news was that all patients who received IVC improved and there was no mortality.
Secondly, as compared to the average of a 30-day hospital stay for all Covid-19 patients, those patients who received high dose IVC had a hospital stay about 3-5 days shorter than the overall patients.
Dr. Mao also discussed one particularly severe case where the patient was deteriorating rapidly.
An extra of 50,000 mg IVC dosage was given over a period of 4 hours and it caused the patient’s pulmonary (oxygenation index) status to stabilize and improve as the critical care team watched in real time.
Thus far, there were no seen or reported side effects from any of the cases treated with high dose IVC.
Some Thoughts
This strikes me as interesting news because it has been no secret that Vitamin C treatments, and even clinical trials, are happening in China, and yet during a press conference yesterday where the Donald Trump was addressing the American people, Dr. Deborah Birx, part of his COVID-19 task force, talked about how they are watching what other countries are doing, yet there is still no mention of harmless treatments like vitamin C.
Only vaccines and ventilators. Ventilators are certainly important for more extreme case patients, but is it really the case that we are to wait for a potentially unsafe and ineffectively vaccine without talking about simple and inexpensive treatment options that could even ease public fear?
Again, this is a reflection for the people, where does government loyalty lie? Perhaps it’s with the industry that spends two times more than what any other lobby does in congress.
Would it not be inspiring to see health leaders come on the news and say “Hey, we don’t know for sure if these things will work, just like any other drug or vaccine, but we do know they are harmless if done this way etc.”
And then indicate to people how to eat properly, take vitamin C, herbs, and zinc.
To me, this would feel like we truly are pulling out all the stops to unify and help one another, but instead, it feels like another opportunity to push side effect ridden drugs.
This is where I feel we can see the need for a shift from a culture of disconnection and scarcity, to one of connection and abundance.
Remember, scarcity in our society today is 100% manmade, it is a factor of our economic design, it isn’t real. Think of how banks can get bailed out by printing money out of thin air.
This means the same could be done for healthcare, supplements, people’s debt etc, but it isn’t done because the majority need to be financially weaker for the rich to have their cake.
I don’t share this stuff to enrage people, or to judge the leaders, in fact, neither of those two actions will help us in this situation.
I say this because it’s the truth and only when we know that can we begin to change our story and what we choose to support. Now is a perfect time for that.

 Scientific Studies Suggest Zinc Has Antiviral Effects,"Four studies from the University of Oxford, the American Society for Microbiology, the U.S. National Library of Medicine, and PLOS Pathogen outline the antiviral effects of zinc in the human body, including the immune system and respiratory system, and its efficacy against the common cold and coronavirus.
From Oxford Academic:
The Role of Zinc in Antiviral Immunity
ABSTRACT

Zinc is an essential trace element that is crucial for growth, development, and the maintenance of immune function. Its influence reaches all organs and cell types, representing an integral component of approximately 10% of the human proteome, and encompassing hundreds of key enzymes and transcription factors.
Zinc deficiency is strikingly common, affecting up to a quarter of the population in developing countries, but also affecting distinct populations in the developed world as a result of lifestyle, age, and disease-mediated factors.
Consequently, zinc status is a critical factor that can influence antiviral immunity, particularly as zinc-deficient populations are often most at risk of acquiring viral infections such as HIV or hepatitis C virus. This review summarizes current basic science and clinical evidence examining zinc as a direct antiviral, as well as a stimulant of antiviral immunity.
An abundance of evidence has accumulated over the past 50 y to demonstrate the antiviral activity of zinc against a variety of viruses, and via numerous mechanisms.
Clinical studies using zinc supplementation are primarily limited to rhinovirus infection, and are often grouped with other “common cold” viruses such as influenza and coronaviruses.
The majority of studies use zinc lozenges with various zinc formulations and concentrations, possibly explaining the large variability in results [extensively reviewed in (108) and (109)].
Importantly, the amount of ionic zinc present at the site of infection (oral and nasal mucosa) is highly correlated to the study outcome (51, 108), and is dependent on the zinc formulation.
At a physiological pH and 37°C, zinc gluconate for example, releases high amounts of ionic zinc, whereas zinc aspartate releases none (108).
Upon examining only the relevant studies where high doses of ionic zinc were used, a clear reduction in cold duration of 42% was calculated (109).
Whether this was caused by viral inhibition, improved local immune response, or an amelioration of symptoms remains uncertain.

 Vaccine For The China Virus — The Planet Is The Guinea Pig For A Vast Experiment,"The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) is launching a rush program to develop a vaccine against the China coronavirus. The goal? Have a vaccine ready for human testing in an unprecedented 90 days.
NIH is partnering with a US vaccine company, Moderna, Inc.
The vaccine is a new type called RNA. According to Reuters (“With Wuhan virus genetic code in hand, scientists begin work on a vaccine,” Jan 24, 2020), “[these are] vaccines based on ribonucleic acid (RNA)—a chemical messenger that contains instructions for making proteins.”

The PHG Foundation/University of Cambridge explains further: “Unlike a normal vaccine, RNA vaccines work by introducing an mRNA sequence (the molecule which tells cells what to build) which is coded for a disease specific antigen [virus]; once produced within the body, the antigen [virus] is recognised by the immune system, preparing it to fight the real thing.”
Let’s have a look at Moderna (twitter), the company that will be making and testing the new RNA vaccine against the China coronavirus.
Its website states, in a January 23rd press release:
“Moderna Announces Funding Award from CEPI to Accelerate Development of Messenger RNA (mRNA) Vaccine Against Novel Coronavirus”.
Funded by CEPI. Who is that? (twitter) Its website states:
“CEPI is a innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations. We’re working together to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and enable equitable access to these vaccines for people during outbreaks.”
A more relevant quote:
“CEPI was founded in Davos by the governments of Norway and India, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the Wellcome Trust, and the World Economic Forum.”
Bill Gates. Doesn’t that send your trust and faith rocketing up into the sky?
Related: 1. Bill Gates & World Economic Forum Ran Coronavirus Outbreak Simulation Just 6 Weeks Before The Real Outbreak 2. Bill Gates Funded The PIRBRIGHT Institute, Which Owns A Patent On Coronavirus; The CDC Owns The Strain Isolated From Humans
There is more. Going back to the Moderna Inc. website — at the bottom of the press release referenced above, we find a VERY interesting statement, in a section titled, “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”: “…there has never been a commercial product utilizing mRNA technology approved for use…”
And there you have it. The vaccine that is being tapped by the US government… under its National Institutes of Health…through drug company Moderna… HAS NEVER BEEN USED ON THE PUBLIC BEFORE. IT IS NOT LICENSED FOR PUBLIC USE.
RNA VACCINES AND THE TECHNOLOGY THEY USE ARE ENTIRELY EXPERIMENTAL. AND THIS IS THE TYPE OF VACCINE BEING RUSHED INTO EXISTENCE IN 90 DAYS.
What in the world could possibly go wrong?
One way to find out is to unleash it on millions of people, stand back, and see.
The PHG Foundation at the University of Cambridge gives us a substantial clue: “… better understanding of [RNA] vaccine adverse effects is needed – these can include inflammation or autoimmune reactions.”
Autoimmune reactions—the human immune system attacks healthy elements and processes of the body itself. The body goes to war with itself.
I’m sure you would volunteer for a test run of the vaccine, right? You would certainly offer up your child for a grand experiment, wouldn’t you?
And if you’re a doctor reading this, you’ll definitely inject the vaccine into unsuspecting patients, won’t you? Conscience is such an annoyance, isn’t it?
ISN’T IT?
Don’t you want to have the whole world as your guinea pig?

 Ron Paul: Central Banking is Socialism,"Last week, the Federal Reserve responded to Wall Street’s coronavirus panic with an “emergency” interest rate cut.
This emergency cut failed to revive the stock market, leading to predictions that the Fed will again cut rates later this month.
More rate cuts would drive interest rates to near, or even below, zero. Lowering interest rates punishes people for saving, thus encouraging consumers and businesses to spend every penny they make.

This may give the economy a short-term boost. But, it inhibits long-term economic growth by depleting the savings necessary for investments in businesses and jobs.
The result of this policy will be more pressure on the Fed to indefinitely maintain low interest rates and on the Congress and president to create another explosion of government “stimulus” spending.
Boston Federal Reserve President Eric Rosengren has suggested that Congress allow the Federal Reserve to add assets of private companies to the Fed’s already large balance sheet.
Allowing the central bank to buy assets of, and thus assume a partial ownership interest in, private companies would give the Federal Reserve even greater influence over the economy.
It could also allow the Fed to advance a political agenda by, for example, favoring investment in “green energy” companies over other companies or refusing to purchase assets of retailers who sell firearms or tobacco products.
Mr. Rosengren’s proposal to allow the central bank to “invest,” in private companies seems like something one would hear from democratic socialists like Senator Bernie Sanders.
This is not surprising since the entire Federal Reserve system is a textbook example of socialism.
The essence of socialist economics is government allocation of resources either by seizing direct control of the “means of production” or by setting prices business can charge.
Federal Reserve manipulation of interest rates is an attempt to set the price of money. Federal Reserve attempts to set interest rates distort the signals sent by the rates to investors and business.
This results in a Fed-created boom, which is inevitably followed by a Fed-created bust.
Economic elites benefit when the Federal Reserve pumps new money into the economy because they have access to the money created before there are widespread price increases.
Artificially low interest rates also facilitate the growth of the welfare-warfare state.
The Federal Reserve’s inflationary policies harm the average American by eroding the dollar’s purchasing power. This forces consumers to rely on credit cards and other forms of debt to maintain their standard of living.
Many Americans are unable to afford their own homes because they are saddled with student loan debt that can even exceed their income.
Since the bailouts of 2008, there has been a growing understanding that the current system is rigged in favor of the elites and against the average American.
Unfortunately, popular confusion of our system of Keynesian neoliberalism with a free-market economy, combined with a widespread entitlement mentality, has led many Americans to support increasing government control of our economy.
The key to beating back the rising support for socialism on both the left and right is helping more people understand that big government and central banking are the cause of their problems and that free markets in all areas — and especially in money — is the solution.
It is important that the liberty movement put pressure on Congress to cut spending and rein in or, better yet, end the Fed.

Update (2000ET): Prepare for the Phase 1 Trade deal to collapse due to “force majeure”: according to White House National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien, China’s agricultural purchases from the first phase of a trade deal may not be as large as the Trump administration had hoped due to the coronavirus.

“It could have an impact on how big, at least in this current year, the purchases are,” O’Brien said at an Atlantic Council event Tuesday in Washington. He also said American doctors are still not being let into China to deal with the outbreak.
Update (1900ET): After a relatively quiet 36 hours for the ‘Diamond Princess’, Japanese authorities reported 39 more cases, bringing the total to 174 out of 492 people on board tested, while Japan’s defense Minister Taro Kono tweeted that a quarantine officer from the health ministry also tested positive for the virus.
As Bloomberg notes, Carnival’s Diamond Princess cruise ship has become the biggest center of infection of any place outside of China. The Diamond Princess was placed under quarantine last week and checks were conducted after a passenger from Hong Kong who had been on the ship tested positive for the virus.
The ship has become a case of concern because of the possibility of more infections in the vessel’s confined spaces, and the increased risks to elderly passengers.
Update (1720ET): The latest figures out of Hubei Province suggest that the outbreak is beginning to wane, even as WSJ and other Western media outlets question whether the official figures are trustworthy.
Hubei reported another 94 deaths on Tuesday, less than the 100+ deaths reported for Monday, and 1,638 new cases,well below 2,478 new cases on Monday. However, while the number of new cases may be declining, the number of people in serious condition has continued to climb: It was 6,344 yesterday, but on Tuesday was 7,241.
The new numbers bring the global totals for cases and deaths to 44,753 cases and 1,112 deaths.
Meanwhile, WSJ reports the shocking callousness with which Chinese doctors treated sick people in Wuhan who failed tests for the virus for reasons not yet well understood. Some of the anecdotes about horribly ill people going home to wait until they can take another test – and then praying for the correct diagnosis when it was obvious to all they had the virus – are particularly harrowing.
Update (1415ET): For everybody buying on Tuesday, uber-dove Jim Bullard, the president of the St. Louis Fed, has some advice: until the coronavirus pandemic has been completely contained, it will continue to pose a tail risk to the market.
Bullard, who spoke Tuesday following Congressional testimony by Fed Chairman Jay Powell, added that the three rate cuts last year will cushion the economy, but even that might not be enough to offset all of the economic uncertainty that markets are facing this year, from the virus to the presidential race.
This after Powell – who was attacked by President Trump in the middle of his testimony via another Fed-bashing tweet calling for lower rates and a weaker dollar -said that the US economy “looks resilient” despite the coronavirus risk.
But Bullard apparently maintains a somewhat more cautious view:
“The efforts to bring the virus under control are substantial enough that the Chinese economy is expected to grow noticeably slower in the first quarter of 2020 than it otherwise would have,” Mr. Bullard said. “Experience with previous viral outbreaks suggests that the effects on U.S. interest rates can be tangible and last until the outbreak is clearly contained,” he said.
As futures markets price in at least one rate cut in 2020, Bullard said monetary policy “feels a bit too accommodative.” That’s saying something coming from one of the more dovish Fed presidents, though Bullard won’t be a FOMC voter again until 2022, assuming he’s still the president of the St. Louis Fed at that time.
The easing has shifted the outlook for short-term US rates considerably, he added.
“The efforts to bring the virus under control are substantial enough that the Chinese economy is expected to grow noticeably slower in the first quarter of 2020 than it otherwise would have,” Bullard said. “Experience with previous viral outbreaks suggests that the effects on U.S. interest rates can be tangible and last until the outbreak is clearly contained.”
But ultimately, we will need to “wait and see” whether the coronavirus truly becomes the catalyst of a global slowdown, like many analysts fear. Barring that, “the current baseline outlook for 2020 suggests a reasonable chance that a soft landing will be achieved,” Bullard said.
The St. Louis Fed twitter account shared this report that seems to expand upon the theme that monetary policy is much looser than the market realizes.
In other news, Germany has confirmed two more cases in Bavaria, bringing the total to 14.
Update (1330ET): Beijing has reportedly arrested another citizen journalist named Fang Bin. His arrest follows that of Chen Quishi, whose whereabouts are still unknown days after his disappearance.
Hilton is one of the latest American companies to warn about how the coronavirus outbreak will impact its business. The company said it could suppress travel numbers for up to a year, with their predictions based on what happened during the SARS epidemic. Facebook and Cisco have joined Sony and several other firms in pulling out of the Mobile World Congress, which was scheduled for Barcelona, Spain, a place the virus hasn’t yet touched.

This all comes after Under Armor warned about a $60 million sales hit, sending its stock tumbling lower. And it’s only the latest retailer to warn about the virus’s squeeze on sales.
In one of the more shocking revelations on Tuesday, the CDC said a “lab mix-up” is what led to them nearly releasing an infected patient back into mandatory quarantine on a nearby military base.
On the other hand, several carmakers including Hyundai and Ford confirmed that they had reopened at least some plants on Monday after idling them for all of last week.
Dr. Anne Schuchat, a top official at the CDC, told reporters in Washington, admitted that “it turns out there was probably a mix up and the original test wasn’t negative.” Earlier, state officials claimed the initial test was negative, but a second test was positive.
As we noted earlier, four evacuees at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego had been in federal quarantine after showing symptoms of the virus. After testing negative for the virus, they were returned to the base on Sunday where they joined more than 200 people who are stuck there under a 14-day quarantine order. The patient who tested positive was immediately returned to isolation, according to CNBC.
Google trends shows that interest in the virus remains elevated, though it has fallen from a peak reached on Jan. 31.
Finally, the WHO gave the virus a new name: Covid-19.
Update (1035ET): Two inmates at HMP Bullinton prison in Oxfordshire, UK are being tested for coronavirus, according to Sky News.
The men are being kept in isolation in their cells, while access has been restricted to the wing where the prisoners are. HMP Bullington has capacity for 1,114 inmates, and holds both prisoners on remand and who have been sentenced, along with young adults aged 18-21, according to Sky.
Eight people in the UK have been confirmed as having coronavirus – four of them testing positive on Monday.
Update (0900ET): The Guardian reports that the diagnosis of four people living in a single apartment block in Hong Kong that has been evacuated and some of its residents quarantined has prompted worried comparisons to SARS.
Medical workers descended on the apartment block in Tsing Yi district wearing full protective suits and evacuated 100 people in 34 apartments after cases were identified more than 10 floors apart, suggesting that the virus may have traveled through the pipes.
One 62-year-old woman was among the victims, and she apparently passed it to her son and daughter-in-law who live with her and were among seven new cases reported on Tuesday, raising the city’s total to 49, leaving it in third place overall, behind mainland China and the ‘Diamond Princess’, which is under quarantine in Yokohama.
The worsening outbreak a high profile incident of an individual believed to have tried to escape quarantine prompted Carrie Lam to threaten affixing GPS tracking devices to anyone in an HK quarantine.
Johns Hopkins
Plumbing was a problem during the SARS outbreak as well, as there were incidents where the virus traveled through the pipes.
Meanwhile, the Westerdam luxury liner still hasn’t found anywhere to dock after Thailand refused it entry earlier on Tuesday, which we noted below.
In other China news, the Communist Party Boss of Huangguang, a city that has been badly impacted by the outbreak, warned taht the crisis in his city is still “Very severe.” We suspect he will be scapegoated by this time tomorrow.
After appearing in public yesterday for the first time since the outbreak kicked into high gear, President Xi said Tuesday that China will be “more prosperous” after the outbreak (despite its economy-crushing blowback). It’s the latest sign that Beijing is growing desperate to convince the public that China’s slowing economy can weather the outbreak without a severe downturn.
It begs the question: Will Xi add the capitalist concept of ‘creative destruction’ to his ‘Xi Jinping Thought’?
Meanwhile, Reuters reported on Tuesday that Xi warned top party officials last week that the country’s efforts to contain the outbreak – including quarantining 400 million+ people inside their homes and locking down whole cities – had gone too far. Xi fretted that the lockdown would threaten China’s fragile economy. Protecting and nurturing economic growth is Xi’s No. 1 priority in office and the bedrock of his ‘mandate’ to govern.
It’s unclear where Reuters got its information, but it claimed Xi made the remark during a Feb. 3 Politburo Standing Committee meeting that has already been covered by media reports (hand-picked comments were passed to state press). It just shows how much Cina’s tepid growth last year, the weakest in nearly 30 years, has been weighing on the president’s mind.
After reviewing reports on the outbreak from the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and other economic departments, Xi told local officials during a Feb 3 meeting of the Politburo’s Standing Committee that some of the actions taken to contain the virus are harming the economy, said two people familiar with the meeting, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
He urged them to refrain from “more restrictive measures”, the two people said.
Local authorities outside Wuhan – where the virus is thought to have first taken hold – have shut down schools and factories, sealed off roads and railways, banned public events and even locked down residential compounds. Xi said some of those steps have not been practical and have sown fear among the public, they said.
China’s state council information office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In an incident that mirrors the circumstances of the 13th virus case diagnosed in the US by health officials in San Diego, Bloomberg reports that two Japanese men who were evacuated from Wuhan late last month have tested positive for 2019-nCoV after earlier having been cleared by the Japanese health ministry.
It’s just the latest sign that the virus may be undetectable — or ‘silent’ — for a period, allowing its host to unknowingly spread it without being detected.
Health officials let the coronavirus patient in San Diego travel back to the army base quarantine briefly before realizing the error and recalling her to the hospital.
The case brings Japan’s total to 28 (not including the 136+ trapped aboard the DP).
In other news, the NYT reported late Monday that scientists are growing increasingly suspicious of Indonesia, and the fact that no cases have been reported in the country, despite thousands of tourists from Wuhan and Hubei visiting the country after the outbreak began.
Many worry Indonesia is simply ignoring the threat, given that it was relatively slow to freeze flights from China. A consular official estimated that 5,000 Chinese remained in Bali alone, including 200 people from Wuhan.
“So far, Indonesia is the only major country in Asia that does not have a corona case,” Indonesia’s security minister, Mohammad Mahfud MD, told reporters on Friday. “The coronavirus does not exist in Indonesia.”
None of the 285 people who were evacuated from Wuhan and are now in quarantine on the Indonesian island of Natuna have shown signs of the virus, he added.
Update (0800ET): CNBC’s Eunice Yoon tweeted out a report that aired early Tuesday morning on CNBC detailing the struggles of one factory owner as China lurches slowly back to work.
The takeaway: Much of China’s economy, particularly its industrial core, remains shuttered.
A 13th case of the Wuhan coronavirus has been confirmed in the US after one of the Americans who traveled to California from the epicenter of the outbreak on an evacuation flight last week has been determined to have contracted the virus.
Like with cockroaches, where there is one case of coronavirus, there will likely be more, especially since the patient traveled on a long-haul flight with dozens of others, increasingly the likelihood that at least some of them were infected.
The State Department chartered four flights to rescue more than 800 Americans who had been trapped in Wuhan by the quarantine passed by Chinese officials on Jan. 23. One American who apparently opted to stay behind in Wuhan has succumbed to the virus, according to Chinese officials.
Even more alarmingly, the evacuee was accidentally mistakenly released from UC San Diego Medical Center, though she wasn’t released to the public: All evacuees will spend 14 days on designated military bases being repurposed as quarantines. The case was the first in San Diego.
Initially, the hospital reported that four patients undergoing testing at the hospital had tested negative for the virus, and they were discharged and returned to federal quarantine at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, where more than 200 evacuees are staying.
However, “further testing revealed that one of the four patients tested positive for 2019-nCoV,” CDC officials advised San Diego Public Health on Monday morning, and the person was returned to hospital” for observation, the hospital said in a statement.
The CDC said it’s tracing all of the individual’s contacts since arriving in the US, Reuters reports.
“CDC is conducting a thorough contact investigation of the person who has tested positive to determine contacts and to assess if those contacts had high risk exposures.”
Most US-China flights have been suspended by the White House, and only a handful of American nationals arriving on commercial flights from China have been quarantined under rules imposed on Feb. 2 to curb the virus’s spread.
There are now at least 3 cases of the virus diagnosed in California.
Out of eight states that have set up airport screenings for the virus, only six of them said they had no one under quarantine, while NY said it had 4 and Illinois aid it had a “tiny” number.
In China, the scapegoating continued on Tuesday as Beijing fired two of the most senior health officials in Hubei just hours after officials reported 108 new deaths from the virus on Monday, the first time a daily death toll has topped 100. Only 2 of the more than 1,000 deaths occurred outside mainland China.
Zhang Jin, the Communist party boss of the provincial health commission in Hubei, and its director Liu Yingzi were removed by decree of the party yesterday.
In their stead, senior Beijing official Chen Yixin has been sent to Wuhan to lead virus-suppression efforts at the crisis’s ground zero. Chen, a former deputy party chief in Hubei, will be deputy head of a central government group dispatched to the province.
Additionally, 3 senior Wuhan officials have been summoned to Beijing to explain their failings, according to state media reports cited by the SCMP.
Authorities were accused of playing down the extent of the outbreak in early January because they wanted to project an image of stability.
Wuhan authorities also faced criticism for going ahead with an annual public banquet for 40,000 families just days before the city was placed on lockdown, according to the Daily Mail. Beijing is of course trying to deflect attention from the senior Party leadership’s failures — failures that are implicit in their policies which guarantee the suppression of information during crises.
However, the death of Dr. Li Wenliang late last week made it almost inevitable that the locals in Wuhan and Hubei would be punished – after all, it was Wuhan police who initially reprimanded Dr. Li for his warnings about the outbreak. Warnings that, if heeded, would have helped save hundreds of lives.
A top Red Cross official in Wuhan was also removed for dereliction of duty earlier this month. Local officials have faced an intense backlash almost since the beginning, once it had become clear that the virus had been allowed to spread within Wuhan without police or health authorities doing anything to stop it.

“Right now I’m in a state of guilt, remorse and self-reproach” said the official in an interview with CCTV last month.”
“If strict control measures had been taken earlier, the result would have been better than now.”
In South Korea, Reuters reports that the first confirmed coronavirus patient is returning to Wuhan (apparently despite the lockdown) after being discharged by the South Korean medical team that treated her.
While searching through virus-related headlines this morning, we stumbled on a telling example of Beijing’s strategy of extreme media censorship after its brief experiment with ‘openness’ provoked widespread public rage.
Consider this contrast: A doctor who helped lead the fight against SARS in Hong Kong warned Tuesday that nCoV could infect “60% to 80%” of the global population if left unchecked.
While on the mainland, the state media reported that another veteran SARS fighter named Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government’s senior medical adviser, is claiming that the outbreak is peaking right now.
In an interview with Reuters, the 83-year-old scientists who helped fight the SARS epidemic said his model showed the virus should peak in the middle of February.
Echoing comments from President Trump, the scientist added that he hoped the virus would peter out by April.
“I hope this outbreak or this event may be over in something like April,” he said in a hospital run by Guangzhou Medical University, where 11 coronavirus patients were being treated.
“We don’t know why it’s so contagious, so that’s a big problem,” added Zhong, whose previous forecast of an earlier peak turned out to be premature. He said there was a gradual reduction in new cases in the southern province of Guangdong where he was, and also in Zhejiang and elsewhere.
Finally, the man from Brighton believed to be the ‘super spreader’ linked to 11 cases involving a French ski chateau has broken his silence, according to the Guardian.
His name is Steve Walsh, he’s 53 years old, and this is his story:
“I would like to thank the NHS for their help and care – whilst I have fully recovered, my thoughts are with others who have contracted coronavirus.”
“As soon as I knew I had been exposed to a confirmed case of coronavirus I contacted my GP, NHS 111 and Public Health England.”
“I was advised to attend an isolated room at hospital, despite showing no symptoms, and subsequently self-isolated at home as instructed.”
“When the diagnosis was confirmed I was sent to an isolation unit in hospital, where I remain, and, as a precaution, my family was also asked to isolate themselves.”
“I also thank friends, family and colleagues for their support during recent weeks and I ask the media to respect our privacy.”
Over in Hong Kong, dozens of residents of a housing complex in Hong Kong have been quarantined after two people living on separate floors were infected with the virus, raising the possibility that it might have been traveling through the pipes.
Per local officials from Hong Kong’s Center for Health Protection, the decision to partially evacuate the building was made after investigators discovered an unsealed bathroom pipe in the apartment of a 62-year-old woman found to be infected. She lives 10 floors below another resident who was found to be infected, the NYT reports.
Yesterday, we reported that the Westerdam cruise ship had finally been granted permission to dock in Thailand after being turned away from three other countries, despite having ZERO confirmed nCoV cases aboard. Now, Thailand has rejected it, leaving it once again adrift. The ship is set to run out of food and other essentials in just two days.

 WHO’s Concern is Political Correctness – Gives Coronavirus a New Name to Prevent ‘Stigmatization’,"The World Health Organization has given coronavirus a new name in order to prevent people feeling ‘stigmatized’.
Yes, because the first thing a global health authority tasked with preventing a mass deadly virus outbreak should be concerned about is political correctness.
The coronavirus has been officially named ‘COVID-19’ because according to the WHO, “We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical location, an animal, an individual or group of people.”
“Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing,” the organization added.

 
The name change is in line with the WHO’s official statement when they first declared coronavirus to be a global emergency, which warned countries against any actions that would “promote stigma or discrimination” and asserted that maintaining the “international traffic” of people was essential and should not be interfered with.

Respondents to the name change on Twitter weren’t impressed:
“Damn, I was going to name ChinamanNastyVirus-20,” commented one.
“Wait so avoiding stigma is more important than saving lives??” asked another.
“At this age, people are just gonna refer to it as coronavirus or that virus from China bcos they kept eating the fvcking bats,” remarked another user.

 Coronavirus – China’s Secret Plan To Weaponize Viruses,"Did China’s Plan to Destroy the United States Backfire?
In a secret speech given to high-level Communist Party cadres nearly two decades ago, Chinese Defense Minister Gen. Chi Haotian explained a long-range plan for ensuring a Chinese national renaissance.
He said there were three vital issues that must be grasped. The first was the issue of living space — because China is severely overpopulated and China’s environment is deteriorating.
The second issue, therefore, is that the Communist Party must teach the Chinese people to “go out.” By this Gen. Chi meant the conquest of new lands in which a “second China” could be built by “colonization.” From this arises the third vital issue: the “issue of America.”

Gen. Chi warned his listeners:
“This appears to be shocking, but the logic is actually very simple.” China is “in fundamental conflict with the Western strategic interest.” Therefore, the United States will never allow China to seize other countries to build a second China. The United States stands in China’s way.
Chi explained the problem as follows:
“Would the United States allow us to go out to gain new living space? First, if the United States is firm in blocking us, it is hard for us to do anything significant to Taiwan, Vietnam, India, or even Japan, [so] how much more living space can we get? Very trivial! Only countries like the United States, Canada, and Australia have the vast land to serve our need for mass colonization.”
“We are not as foolish as to want to perish together with America by using nuclear weapons,” said the general.
“Only by using non-destructive weapons that can kill many people will we be able to reserve America for ourselves.” The answer is found in biological weapons.
“Of course,” he added, “we have not been idle, in the past years we have seized the opportunity to master weapons of this kind.”
The ruling Chinese Communist Party considers biological weapons to be the most important weapons for accomplishing their goal of “cleaning up America.”
Chi credits Deng Xiaoping with putting biological weapons ahead of all other weapon systems in the Chinese arsenal:
“When Comrade Xiaoping was still with us, the Party Central Committee had the perspicacity to make the right decision not to develop aircraft carrier groups and focus instead on developing lethal weapons that can eliminate mass populations of the enemy country.”
It may seem difficult to believe, but Gen. Chi considered himself to be a “humanitarian” communist, and therefore admitted to mixed personal feelings on this matter:
“I sometimes think how cruel it is for China and the United States to be enemies. …” After all, he noted, the United States helped China in World War II. Chinese people remember that the United States opposed Japanese imperialism. But none of that matters now.
“In the long run,” said Gen. Chi, “the relationship of China and the United States is one of a life-and-death struggle.”
This tragic situation must be accepted. According to Gen. Chi, “We must not forget that the history of our civilization repeatedly has taught us that one mountain does not allow two tigers to live together.”
According to Gen. Chi, China’s overpopulation problem and environmental degradation will eventually result in social collapse and civil war. General Chi estimated that “more than 800 million” Chinese would die in such a collapse. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party has no policy alternative.
Either the United States is “cleaned up” by biological attacks, or China suffers national catastrophe.
Chi makes the following argument:
“We must prepare ourselves for two scenarios. If our biological weapons succeed in the surprise attack, the Chinese people will be able to keep their losses at a minimum in the fight against the United States. If, however, the attack fails and triggers a nuclear retaliation from the United States, China would perhaps suffer a catastrophe in which more than half of its population would perish. That is why we need to be ready with air defense systems for our big and medium-sized cities.”
In his speech, Gen. Chi provides us with a key for understanding China’s development strategy. According to Chi, “Our economic development is all about preparing for the needs of war!”
It’s not about improving the life of Chinese people in the short run. It’s not about building a consumer-oriented capitalist society.
“Publicly, said Gen, Chi, “we still emphasize economic development as our center, but in reality, economic development has war as its center!”
Weaponizing Viruses
The West has yet to grasp the underlying motive for China’s ready participation in the West’s P4 microbiology labs, where the world’s most deadly microbes are studied (i.e., pathogen lethality level 4 labs). This now bubbles to the surface in the novel coronavirus pandemic that has occurred in Wuhan, at the heart of China, just outside China’s principle P4 virology lab (specializing in deadly viruses).
Not long after delivering his speech, Gen. Chi stepped down as Defense Minister in 2003, the same year as the SARS (coronavirus) outbreak in China. This was also (coincidentally) the same year Beijing decided to build the Wuhan P4 virology lab. Given Gen. Chi’s speech, is the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan an accident occasioned by weaponizing the virus at the city’s P4 microbiology lab?
Three data points are worth considering. First, in 2008 Taiwan’s top security official told lawmakers that “Taiwan had intelligence linking the SARS virus to research done in Chinese labs,” according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
Given China’s economic clout and political infiltration of Chinese-language media, it’s not surprising that National Security Bureau Director Tsai Chao-ming was forced to retract his statement, which had none of the usual features of a “gaffe.” Was Director Tsai forced to retract a statement that was true, since he could not reveal his intelligence sources inside China?
The second data point worth considering: The Virology Journal has an article by Gulfaraz Khan, published on Feb. 28, 2013, outlining the discovery of a novel coronavirus in Saudi Arabia in June 2012.
Yes, it’s the very same coronavirus with the following difference: When first discovered it couldn’t be readily transmitted from human to human. Something changed in the virus since that time. Thus, the Wuhan version is labeled 2019-nCoV instead of simply NCoV. The latter is not contagious, while the former is spreading rapidly through China as these words are written.
What do you suppose changed its transmissibility between 2012 and 2020? Random mutation or weaponization?
(This question has now been answered by Indian scientists who discovered Coronavirus was engineered with HIV AIDS like insertions.)
If the current lethal outbreak had occurred in any other city than Wuhan, we might be inclined to believe in a random mutation. But Wuhan is ground zero for Chinese bioweapons. Should we credit such a coincidence?
The third data point worth considering: the journal GreatGameIndia has published a piece titled “Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It.”
The authors were clever enough to put Khan’s Virology Journal article together with news of a security breach by Chinese nationals at the Canadian (P4) National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg, where the novel coronavirus was allegedly stored with other lethal organisms.
Last May, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were called in to investigate; by late July the Chinese were kicked out of the facility. The chief Chinese scientist (Dr. Xiangguo Qiu) was allegedly making trips between Winnipeg and Wuhan.
Here we have a plausible theory of the NCoV organism’s travels: first discovered in Saudi Arabia, then studied in Canada from whence it was stolen by a Chinese scientist and brought to Wuhan. Like the statement of Taiwan’s intelligence chief in 2008, the GreatGameIndia story has come under intensive attack. Whatever the truth, the fact of proximity and the unlikelihood of mutation must figure into our calculations.
It’s highly probable that the 2019-nCoV organism is a weaponized version of the NCoV discovered by Saudi doctors in 2012.
We must have an investigation of the outbreak in Wuhan. The Chinese must grant the world total transparency. The truth must come out. If Chinese officials are innocent, they have nothing to hide. If they are guilty, they will refuse to cooperate.
The real concern here is whether the rest of the world has the courage to demand a real and thorough investigation. We need to be fearless in this demand and not allow “economic interests” to play a coy and dishonest game of denial. We need an honest inquiry. We need it now.

" UK Researcher Predicts Over 250,000 Chinese Will Have Coronavirus In 10 Days","When it comes to estimating the human capital and potential fallout from a highly contagious epidemic, arguably the most important variable is the R0 (“R-naught”) value of the disease, which represents the average number of secondary cases arising from an average primary case in a entirely susceptible population.
That’s the technical definition, a simpler one is that the R0, or basic reproductive number, of a contagious disease is the number of cases that a case of the disease generates over the course of its infectious period in a susceptible population.
The higher this number, the more dangerous the disease, the more lethal the outcome.

Some indicative R0s are 0.9 – 2.1 for the common flu while the 1918-1919 pandemic-causing Spanish flu was estimated to have ranged from 1.4 – 2.8, with a mean of 2.
Some other notable R0s are shown below, and note that SARS was between 2 and 5:

So what about the R0 of 2019-nCoV, also known as the coronavirus that has claimed over three dozen lives in China and infected (at least) 1,000 people?
Naturally, since the disease is most active in China which is notoriously opaque especially when it comes to matters that can cause a mass panic, the best one can do is guess, and that’s what the World Health Organization did yesterday when it issued a statement on the coronavirus epidemic with the following projection:
Human-to-human transmission is occurring and a preliminary R0 estimate of 1.4-2.5 was presented. Amplification has occurred in one health care facility.
Of confirmed cases, 25% are reported to be severe. The source is still unknown (most likely an animal reservoir) and the extent of human-to-human transmission is still not clear.
Needless to say, while 2.5 is quite high, and in line with that of the Spanish flu epidemic which infected about half a billion people back in 1918, killing as many as 100 million before it eventually fizzled out, the real coronavirus R0 number may end up being far higher.
That is the working hypothesis of Jonathan Read, a UK expert on the transmission and evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases, who has published a paper with four colleagues that estimates transmission parameters for the Wuhan coronavirus, calculates that the R0 of 2019-nCoV to be between 3.6-4.0 or roughly the same as SARS, and reaches a conclusion about spread of the coronavirus epidemic that is frankly terrifying.
In “Novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV: early estimation of epidemiological parameters and epidemic predictions“, Read et al, write that with an R0 of between 3.6 and 4.0, roughly 72-75% of transmissions “must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing.”
This is a major problem because Read estimates that only 5.1% of infections in Wuhan are identified (as of Jan 24), “indicating a large number of infections in the community, and also reflecting the difficulty in detecting cases of this new disease.”
Furthermore, since all of this is happening in China which is not known for making the most socially-beneficial decisions under pressure, there is an ominous possibility that Read is actually overly optimistic.

Read wastes no time to get to his terrifying conclusion which is that if no change in control or transmission happens, then further outbreaks will occur in other Chinese cities, “and that infections will continue to be exported to international destinations at an increasing rate.”
As a result, in 10 days time, or by February 4, 2020, Read’s model predicts the number of infected people in Wuhan to be greater than 250 thousand (with an prediction interval, 164,602 to 351,396);

Epidemic predictions for (A) Wuhan, (B) selected Chinese cities and (C) selected countries. Estimated detected cases are also plotted for Wuhan.
After Wuhan, the cities with the largest outbreaks elsewhere in China are expected to be Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chongqing and Chengdu.

Predicted epidemic sizes (number of currently infected individuals) in selected cities on 4 February 2020 assuming no change in transmissibility from current time to 4 February.
Read also predicts that by 4 Feb 2020, the countries at greatest risk of importing infections through air travel are Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, USA, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia and Vietnam. In short: much of Asia will infected, and from there, the rest of the world awaits.

Connectivity of Wuhan to other cities and provinces in mainland China, based on total commercial airline traffic from Wuhan in January 2017.
Critically, Read’s model alleges that Beijing was woefully late in its response and that recently imposed “travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99% effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9% on 4 February.”

Effect of imposing travel restrictions from/to Wuhan on 23 Jan 2020 onwards on the number of infections in other Chinese cities
Read’s prediction is in line with other modeling studies of travel restrictions, which find that reducing travel only serves to delay the epidemic reaching other locations, rather than suppressing the spread entirely.
Still, it is important to note that his model only considered air travel, and did not consider the potential impact of travel restrictions relating to land transportation.
Receive a daily recap featuring a curated list of must-read stories.
That said, Read admits there is a chance that he is wrong, largely due to using flawed assumptions:
Our findings are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model, and the timing and reporting of confirmed cases, and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreak at this early stage.
Yet even with these caveats in mind, Read’s work suggests that a basic reproductive number for this 2019-nCoV outbreak is materially, perhaps catastrophically higher compared to other emergent coronaviruses, “suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.”
Even assuming that most of Read’s assumptions are overly harsh and pessimistic, his summary leaves little hope that the Coronavirus epidemic will be contained any time soon:
“We are still in the early days of this outbreak and there is much uncertainty in both the scale of the outbreak, as well as key epidemiological information regarding transmission.
“However, the rapidity of the growth of cases since the recognition of the outbreak is much greater than that observed in outbreaks of either SARS or MERS-CoV.
“This is consistent with our higher estimates of the reproductive number for this outbreak compared to these other emergent coronaviruses, suggesting that containment or control of this pathogen may be substantially more difficult.”
Finally, while Read makes no observations on the potential mortality associated with nCoV, one can make a broad observation: late on Friday, China’s Hubei province reported 15 additional coronavirus deaths, which added to the previously reported 26 casualties, bringing the total to 41.
And with roughly 1,100 confirmed cases, this means that the mortality rate of the diseases has just jumped from roughly 2.5% to 4%.
Which means that if Read is correct, and if 250,000 people in Hubei alone will be infected by February 4, no less than 10,000 Chinese people will be dead in the next 2-3 weeks.
What happens after that – with China effectively paralyzed by fear and the economy grinding to a halt as nobody leave their home – is anyone’s guess.

 Man Who Survived COVID-19 Says Anti-malaria Drug Saved His Life,"Diagnosed with pneumonia and coronavirus, Rio Giardinieri, 52, was admitted to the ICU at Joe DiMaggio hospital in South Florida.
After more than a week without showing any improvement, doctors told him there was nothing more they could do. Desperately ill, Giardinieri started saying his “goodbyes” to family and friends.
That’s when a friend told him there was a potential “cure” for coronavirus, an anti-malaria drug called hydroxycloroquine.

Though doctors at the hospital said they couldn’t prescribe hydroxycloroquine, they put Giardinieri in touch with an infectious disease doctor who authorized the use. The next morning, he says he woke up feeling “absolutely perfect.”
Giardinieri joined Glenn Beck on the radio program Tuesday to share his remarkable story and to weigh in on why he thinks information about this promising treatment for COVID-19 isn’t being made more readily available.
“I’m not a scientist. I’m not a doctor. I can just tell you how I feel. And I know that I was not doing well. In my mind, I didn’t believe I was going to be here by the morning,” Giardinieri said.
“I don’t know what else to attribute [for recovery] but that medicine … and it’s not just me that it’s worked for. There’re many people this has worked for.
“So, you know, I certainly understand the hospital’s position. They may not be too happy about me telling the story. But the facts are the facts.”

" Bombshell: Chinese Government ALSO Ran A Coronavirus Drill, In Wuhan — Exactly Where the Actual Outbreak Started","This is way beyond the realm of coincidence!
The Chinese Government ran a drill or exercise on September 18th, 2019, in Wuhan, where they simulated a response for … a novel coronavirus strain!
What are the chances of the Chinese authorities randomly choosing to practice for a coronavirus entering their country, given the thousands of pathogens and diseases they could have practiced for?
This drill was held exactly 30 days before the key date of October 18th, 2019 – the same date when the Wuhan Military Games began and also the very same date when Event 201 (Big Pharma, Bill Gates, China’s CDC, America’s CDC, etc.) was held in the USA which was also simulating a ‘fictional’ scenario of how to handle a coronavirus epidemic.
Chinese Government foreknowledge? Chinese authorities conducted a drill for a novel coronavirus 30 days before the Wuhan Military Games began. Note from Jennifer Zeng: There is no photo caption in the original report. Could be someone giving a presentation.
Chinese Government Foreknowledge Beyond the Realm of Coincidence
This information was made possible thanks to the brave reporting of Chinese citizen journalist Jennifer Zeng (and Spiro Skouras for his video interview):

On her site, Zeng posted a English translation of the Chinese article Wuhan Customs Holds 30 Days Countdown to Military Games and Emergency Response Drill at Ports which revealed the drill, which is highly reminiscent of Western (especially USG) false flag operations, which usually contain telltale signs of manipulation such as foreknowledge and ‘coincidental’ drills for an attack or event which later becomes reality.
Here are the first 3 paragraphs:
“This afternoon (September 18), an inbound flight from an unknown country arrived at Wuhan Tianhe International Airport. All in a sudden, the portal nuclear radiation monitoring system alarmed. Wuhan Tianhe International Airport Customs, subordinate of Wuhan Customs, immediately controlled and reinvestigated the passenger who triggered the alarm and his baggage. It is found that the passenger was carrying a bottle of “Myanmar ore” which seriously exceeded the standard radiation level.
In the meantime, an airline company reported that “A passenger on the inbound flight felt uncomfortable, had trouble breathing, and showed unstable vital signs”. The airport customs immediately initiated the contingency plan and quickly started to transfer the patient, clean the aircraft, and further investigate those who had direct and indirect contacts with the passenger. 
Two hours later, the Wuhan Emergency Center reported that the patient had been clinically diagnosed as novel coronavirus infection.
This picture shows the scene where the port emergency response drill was held at the Wuhan airport during the day, in response to the 30-day countdown to the 2019 Wuhan Customs Military Games.
With the Military Game opening within 30 days, the joint executive committee of the Wuhan Customs and Military Games Commission held this emergency response drill at the Wuhan Tianhe Airport, by the theme of “Safeguarding the Customs and Ensuring the Security of the Military Games.”
The purpose of this drill was to enhance risk prevention at the ports, to increase the effectiveness of portal inspections, and to further strengthen the ability of Wuhan Custom to react to urgent incidents, especially in areas of public health …”
The picture referred to is either this one below or the featured image above:
Note from Jennifer Zeng: There is no photo caption in the original report. Could be people attending the drill.
Did You Know? There’s A Connection Between Coronavirus And 5G
Implications
As Zeng says, the average person in China has no idea about the source of the virus, the background to the epidemic and now this new information on Chinese Government foreknowledge. The majority of people there get their information via China’s social media platforms such as WeChat and Weibo – which are heavily monitored and censored.
In fact, there were draconian new laws just passed in China, which decree that you get 15 years in jail for “spreading rumors” and the death sentence for “purposely spreading (the coronavirus) disease.” So what are the implications of this?
Firstly, it shows that Chinese Government – just like the major Western players, USG, CDC, Big Pharma, Bill Gates and co – are in on it.
Secondly, it potentially weakens the theory that this is a race-based bioweapon. If the Chinese knew this was coming and allowed it (at the very least) or deliberately created and released it (at the very worst), they are shooting themselves in the foot. It is far more likely that if they were going to release it in their own territory, they would create a non-race-based bioweapon.
Creator of BioWeapons Act Says: Coronavirus Is Biological Warfare Weapon
Reports are that deaths have climbed in Iran and are starting to accumulate all over the world, so the jury is still out on this issue. It should be noted that the USG certainly has a long history of experimenting upon its own citizens [e.g. Operation Sea-Spray (1950), Norfolk Naval Supply Center experiments (1951), Operation Big Itch (1954), Project 112 (1962), etc.]. Why assume the Chinese Government is any better?
Is the Chinese Government signing on to the depopulation agenda?
There are still many more questions than answers with this coronavirus epidemic, however Chinese Government foreknowledge is a very interesting piece of the puzzle. I will end by linking to another article on Zeng’s website, A State of Torture, which details her extreme suffering at the hands of the brutal Chinese regime which in 1999 turned against Falun Gong practitioners, imprisoning them, torturing them, killing them and even harvesting their organs.
Falun Gong (or Falun Dafa) is a modern Chinese spiritual practice that combines meditation and exercises with a morality-focused philosophy on the 3 qualities of truth, compassion and tolerance. It differs from Qi Gong schools in its absence of fees or formal membership and its lack of ritual. It is entirely apolitical!
It has been shown time and time again to greatly improve mental and physical health. At one point, 1 in every 12 Chinese people were practicing it. Although it in no way threatened the Chinese Government, officials felt outnumbered and their power threatened, so they destroyed it in a savage and sickening fashion. This is, unfortunately, the kind of darkness we are dealing with when it comes to the Chinese Government.

 1981 Dean Koontz Novel Predicted Virus Outbreak Originating in Wuhan,"A fictional plot from a 1981 Dean Koontz novel predicted that a virus originating in Wuhan would cause a global biological pandemic, but despite the creepy similarities to real life, Snopes soon concluded after an “investigation” that the parallels were “mostly false.”
In his thriller The Eyes of Darkness, the best-selling author describes a man-made bioweapon created at a research center in Wuhan, China that is developed “to wipe out a city or a country.”
“They call the stuff ‘Wuhan-400’ because it was developed at their RDNA labs outside the city of Wuhan,” a character says in the novel.

Meanwhile, in reality, a study by scientists at the South China University of Technology in Guangzhou, China concluded that “the killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.”
While the virus in the book is far deadlier than the coronavirus, there are several similarities.
“I will say it’s damned near perfect. Long incubation, asymptomatic spread, infectious as hell,” another character says in the book.

A Snopes investigation of the matter concluded that the claim Koontz predicted the 2020 coronavirus outbreak was “mostly false” because in his story, the virus has a 100% fatality rate.
In addition, in the original version of the book, the biological weapon was named Gorki-400 and was changed to Wuhan for later editions published after 1989.
Once again, by applying such stringent measurements to declaring the prediction “false,” Snopes has mischaracterized the issue.
Yes it is weird that Koontz accurately predicted a virus emerging out of Wuhan that would cause a global biological pandemic.
That doesn’t mean Koontz had any foreknowledge of a conspiracy, but despite Snopes’ best efforts to throw cold water on the issue, it does make his plot eerily prescient.
Meanwhile, in another book called End Of Days: Predictions And Prophecies About The End Of The World, author Sylvia Browne predicted a “pneumonia-like illness” that would sweep the world in 2020.

“In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments,” she wrote. “Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again 10 years later, and then disappear completely.”
No doubt Snopes will “investigate” that too and dismiss it completely.

 Biophysicist Michael Levitt: Coronavirus Will Slow Down & Mankind Will Survive,"I do believe there is a lot of unnecessary hysteria going on right now. That doesn’t mean precautions shouldn’t be taken, but what’s happening right now may be going a little overboard.
Right now, it seems that the majority of people who have the virus are recovering quite well, and that there is greater concern for elderly people and those who already have underlying health issues.
For example, a recent article in Bloomberg titled, “99% of Those Who Died From Virus Had Other Illness, Italy Says,” illustrates that the state of one’s immune system and overall health determines morbidity and mortality, and likely your susceptibility to infection in the first place.

“More than 99% of Italy’s coronavirus fatalities were people who suffered from previous medical conditions, according to a study by the country’s national health authority…
“The Rome-based institute has examined medical records of about 18% of the country’s coronavirus fatalities, finding that just three victims, or 0.8% of the total, had no previous pathology.
“Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses and about a fourth had either one or two previous conditions. More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease.”
Some Good News
According biophysicist Michael Levitt, a Nobel laureate who teaches structural biology at Stanford University, the virus will pass, and all will be as it was.
Levitt became quite a popular name across China. He offered the Chinese public some reassurance during the peak of the outbreak there, as he had determined, after investigating and crunching some numbers, that the virus will come to a halt.
Obviously, it’s spreading quite rapidly right now, so seeing how it may slow down might be hard for some people, but according to what Levitt saw from the numbers in China, other countries should also follow the same trend.
The calming messages Levitt sent to his friends in China were translated into Chinese and passed from person to person, making him a popular subject for interviews in the Asian nation.
His forecasts turned out to be correct: the number of new cases reported each day started to fall as of February 7.
A week later, the mortality rate started falling as well…. Levitt avoids making global forecasts.
In China, he said, the number of new infections will soon reach zero, and South Korea is past the median point and can already see the end. Regarding the rest of the world, it is still hard to tell, he said.
“It will end when all those who are sick will only meet people they have already infected. The goal is not to reach the situation the cruise ship experienced.”
Levitt pointed out that the rate of infection of the virus in the Hubei province in China increased by 30 percent each day. According to him, the entire world should have been infected within 90 days, but obviously this didn’t happen, and hasn’t happened.
When Levitt started analyzing the data on February 1, Hubei had 1,800 new cases each day and within six days this number reached 4,700, he said.
“And then, on February 7, the number of new infections started to drop linearly and did not stop. A week later, the same happened with the number of the deaths.
“This dramatic change in the curve marked the median point and enabled better prediction of when the pandemic will end. Based on that, I concluded that the situation in all of China will improve within two weeks. And, indeed, now there are very few new infection cases.”
Levitt compared the situation to bank interest — if on the first day a person receives an interest rate of 30% on their savings, the next day of 29%, and so forth, “you understand that eventually, you will not earn very much.”
Originally Levitt said that coronavirus patients in China infected on average 2.2 people a day, which would be exponential growth that would lead to nothing but disaster. But then the rates started dropping and China has recently reported that new daily infections are now close to zero.
“The fact that the infection rate is slowing down means the end of the pandemic is near,” he said.
Basically, self-quarantine and social distancing really helps, as well as keeping our social circles to those who we usually interact with the same.
All of the measures that are currently in places are no doubt bound to ‘flatten the curve,’ so there is no doubt that humanity is heading in the right direction and has hopefully already weathered the worst part of the storm.
More Good News
It looks like a treatment program of about 50 patients in China has shown positive results from high dose Vitamin C treatment of COVID-19. Last month, the US National Library of Medicine posted the information about their clinical trials on their website.
The title of one of the trials is “Vitamin C Infusion for the Treatment of Severe 2019-nCoV Infected Pneumonia.” The sponsor is ZhiYong Peng, and the responsible party is Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan University (ZNWU).
Dr. Cheng was paramount in bringing high dose vitamin C to the table as part of potential treatment and prevention measures in China. Unfortunately in the West, this option is still being denied by much of mainstream media and governments are not talking about it.
Instead, it’s fear and chaos which we do not feel serves anyone to stay healthy or get better. I believe this is a great aspect of this journey to reflect on, as it tells us where loyalties lie when it comes to government and pharma.
It also illustrates the agenda for creating a fear and separation culture as opposed to unity.
It would be great to see health leaders come on the news and provide information on how one can strengthen their immune system through the use of foods, herbs etc..
This would also contribute to lessening anxiety instead of constantly hearing “there is no treatment.” Based on what we are seeing happen in Japan and China, this statement is simply not true.

 Where is the World On the “Corona Curve” At This Moment?,"With 1.7 billion people in the world under quarantine (and India about to make that 3 billion) and desperate to find out where on the coronavirus “curve” they are to calculate how much more pain there is, JPM has made an attempt at a (very nonscientific) visual representation of where on the curve the main covid outbreaks in the world currently stand.
The good news: China is now well into the recovery phase, although since any and every number out of China is a lie, we would ignore any reports that the covid pandemic in China is easing especially after a spate of recent indications that China is openly manipulating its infection numbers.
Also good news: Korea is almost “over the hump”, and absent new clusters emerging in the next few days, should be in recovery.

Now the not so good news: both Italy and Iran are in the “late accumulation” phase. If they fail to halt the breakout at this point as the recovery phase approaches, it will get very ugly as much of the local population could then be infected.
Behind Italy and Iran is the rest of Europe, with Spain, Germany, France, the UK all in the acceleration phase. The onus in on them to execute successful lockdowns.
Finally, the bad news: both the US and India are at the very start of the curve and things will get much uglier in the coming weeks before they get better.
Some more observations from JPM:
Global infections accelerated 14% d/d or 45,495 new cases over the last 24 hours to 381,499 according to Johns Hopkins, implying the global curve may be gradually shifting toward an early acceleration stage. The US (13,060 d/d), Spain (6,368 d/d), Italy (4,789 d/d) and Germany (4,183 d/d) reported the most new infections.
In Asia, China’s Hubei reported one new infection after 5 days of no new increase. As recent infection spike in Hong Kong SAR and Singapore suggests, as long as the global infection curve is developing, premature relaxation of heightened community risk awareness could set off a rebound of a controlled infection curve or a second infection wave.
From that vantage, China’s full lift on Wuhan city on 8-Apr bears close watching in our view as infections may appear to persist in society for at least one month.
In ASEAN, 212 new cases were reported in Malaysia, taking total infection to 1,518. Our epidemiology model suggests a mid-April infection peak. Our Australian team reviewed the strategy taken by the government and introduced an epidemiology model, forecasting a possible peak in new cases around 15 April.
Finally, as we noted last night, Trump is now eager to recreate China’s experience and reopen the economy in under 2 weeks to avoid a second great depression. Needless to say, this will be problematic unless the US shifts into the recovery phase by then.

 DoD: Covid-19 “Likely” to be a Pandemic Within the Next 30 Days,"In a document obtained by Newsweek, Department of Defense officials said that Covid-19 will “likely” become a global pandemic within the next 30 days.
This comes after a 23-year-old soldier stationed in South Korea became the first member of the US armed forces to contract the illness.
“The DoD is concerned not only the impact COVID-19 has on mission readiness, but the risk to inadvertently spread the virus to the U.S. by returning members who may have been exposed,” a senior Pentagon official told Newsweek…
…When asked for comment, Jessica R. Maxwell, a DOD spokesperson, said the DoD has “contingency plans in place and are taking steps to educate and safeguard our military and civilian personnel, family members and base communities in preventing widespread outbreak.”

But ultimately, “Commanders of individually affected geographic commands will be and are issuing specific guidance to their forces as their situations may require.”
…The use of the term “pandemic” in the briefing documents described a global outbreak, whereas an “epidemic” would be confined to a country,” a senior Pentagon official told Newsweek. During a pandemic, a large number of people in several countries or continents are affected, according to the CDC. (source)
Arguably, it’s already a pandemic since it has reached every continent except Antarctica. Many people in the United States are paying attention and ratcheting up their preparedness for possible quarantines and other measures.
The National Center for Medical Intelligence (the NCMI) raised the Risk of Pandemic warning from WATCHCON 2 to WATCHCON 1, according to the document obtained by Newsweek. WATCHCON 2 is used in the event of a “probable crisis” and WATCHCON 1 means the crisis is imminent.
This goes hand-in-hand with reports that the military began executing plans to prepare for a potential pandemic two weeks ago. As well, this could be the reason behind President Trump’s deal with the Taliban – it could be an effort to get soldiers out of an area where transmission could be widespread.
The CDC also feels that the risk of a pandemic is high.
The Centers for Disease Control also notes that the likelihood of a global pandemic is high.
At this time, however, most people in the United States will have little immediate risk of exposure to this virus. This virus is NOT currently spreading widely in the United States. However, it is important to note that current global circumstances suggest it is likely that this virus will cause a pandemic. This is a rapidly evolving situation and the risk assessment will be updated as needed.
Current risk assessment:
For the general American public, who are unlikely to be exposed to this virus at this time, the immediate health risk from COVID-19 is considered low.
People in communities where ongoing community spread with the virus that causes COVID-19 has been reported are at elevated though still relatively low risk of exposure.
Healthcare workers caring for patients with COVID-19 are at elevated risk of exposure.
Close contacts of persons with COVID-19 also are at elevated risk of exposure.
Travelers returning from affected international locations where community spread is occurring also are at elevated risk of exposure. (source)
The CDC has been harshly criticized regarding its response to the virus. Tests that they sent out to health departments were faulty, losing weeks of possible containment in the United States. (More on the lack of containment in this article.)
The WHO refuses to call it a pandemic.
Perhaps in an effort to ratchet down the level of fear and panic across the globe, the World Health Organization has not deemed Covid-19 a pandemic.
“Does this virus have pandemic potential? Absolutely, it has. Are we there yet? From our assessment, not yet,” Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told journalists in Geneva.
He explained that the decision to use the word ‘pandemic’ is based on an ongoing assessment of the geographical spread of the virus, the severity of disease it causes, and the impact on society.
“For the moment, we are not witnessing the uncontained global spread of this virus, and we are not witnessing large-scale severe disease or death,” he said, adding that what is occurring is coronavirus epidemics in different parts of the world, which are affecting countries differently. (source)
One must wonder, why is there so much ado about a word? Why is the World Health Organization so reluctant to call this what it is, a pandemic outbreak when it is one, even by their own definition? (That definition, found here, is “A pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease.”)
The preparedness and alternative media worlds are not alone in asking this question.
Lauren Sauer, director of operations for the Johns Hopkins Office of Critical Event Preparedness, told a reporter for the Washington Post, “Personally, I think we’re doing everyone a disservice by continuing this debate…It is creating more panic than just declaring it and moving on.”
The World Bank has an insurance policy against pandemics.
In a possibly unrelated aside, the World Bank has an insurance policy against pandemics but unless certain conditions occur, it won’t pay out, which greatly benefits investors. I use the word “unrelated” because apparently the bonds aren’t dependent on the WHO’s classification of an outbreak.
According to the World Bank, which created the fund three years ago, it was designed to “swiftly funnel funds from the deep-pocketed financial sector to health authorities in poorer countries before international assistance could be mobilized.”
They sold $320 million of these securities, which will mature in July of this year. If it matures, investors could receive double-digit yields. If a pandemic does occur, however, they could lose every penny they put into the fund.
The Class B bond covers conditions that are non-influenza related, like Ebola. But interestingly, the bond never paid out despite the ongoing crisis in the Congo based on the conditions laid out by the bond.
What are those conditions?
The primary one is that there must be more than 250 deaths attributed to the pandemic illness. But for the bond to be payable, there must be more than 20 deaths in a second country, which hasn’t yet occurred with either the coronavirus or Ebola. You can read more about the pandemic bond in these documents.
Whatever you want to call it, Covid-19 is widespread.
People in the United States are definitely concerned if the weekend’s shopping frenzy means anything. To learn more about preparing specifically for this outbreak, go here. To learn more about getting prepped for a quarantine, go here.
Yesterday’s WHO Sitrep report divulged the following information:
Armenia, Czechia, Dominican Republic, Luxembourg, Iceland, and Indonesia all now have confirmed cases of Covid-19.
A WHO team has arrived in Tehran to help with the Iranian response to their outbreak.
Covid-19 has been confirmed in 65 countries across the globe.
You can find the full report here.
It never hurts to get prepared with some extra food, toilet paper, and other supplies. If the Department of Defense is warning that we’re facing a pandemic within 30 days, we can safely say the pandemic has already arrived.

" Nurse Treating Coronavirus Sufferers in China Claims 90,000 People Have Already Been Infected","A nurse wearing a protective suit and face mask treating the sick in Wuhan has claimed that 90,000 people have already been infected by the coronavirus in China – far more than the figure of just 1,975 issued by government officials.
Her warning from the heart of the outbreak emerged as the Chinese government faced accusations of censoring criticism of its handling of the disease in order to play down the crisis.
The outbreak of the new virus originated in China, where it has infected more than 1,970 people and killed 56, and has spread worldwide.

Speaking in video footage seen online, the unnamed woman says:
‘I’m in the area where the coronavirus started. I’m here to tell the truth. At this moment, Hubei province, including Wuhan area, even China, 90,000 people have been infected by coronavirus.’
Chinese President Xi Jinping, saying the country is facing a grave situation, held a politburo meeting on measures to fight the outbreak, state television reported on Saturday.
The country is facing a ‘grave situation’ where the coronavirus is “accelerating its spread,” Xi told the meeting, which took place on the Lunar New Year public holiday.
Despite China being initially praised for its transparency in managing the situation, critics have now claimed that officials are scrubbing the internet of videos that reveal the true situation.
However, the nurse’s report has been viewed almost two million times on YouTube. In the footage, she warns people not to go outside and to refrain from celebrating the Chinese New Year.
Virologist Who Visited Wuhan Says Coronavirus Is “Out Of Control”
She said:
‘I would like to say that everyone who is currently watching this video should not go outside. Don’t party. Do not eat out. Once a year, we celebrate Chinese New Year. If you are safe now, you will be able to meet your family again healthy next year.’
Making a desperate plea for supplies, she said:
‘We don’t care what the government says. I will tell you through social media. Everyone, please donate masks, glasses and clothes to Wuhan.
‘Please help us. Please donate disposable goggles, disposable masks and disposable clothing. Currently our resources are not enough.’
Horrifying clips have been posted online by shocked citizens only to be deleted shortly after. In one, the sick are seen sitting between drips and oxygen tanks next to three dead bodies covered in white sheets. The footage was deleted from social media channel Weibo.
Last week, in rare public dissent, a senior journalist at a Hubei provincial newspaper run by the ruling Communist Party called for an ‘immediate’ change of leadership in Wuhan on Weibo. The post was later removed.
The People’s Daily, a state-owned newspaper, posted a video of an apparently cured patient flashing the peace sign alongside four medics.
But the Global Times revealed that vital resources, including masks and goggles, were urgently needed.
Critics have also claimed that many health experts who would have been able to warn the government at an early stage of the dangers of coronavirus have been detained or had their research stopped because they were not working within the Chinese state.
The accusations of a cover-up echo the furore surrounding the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic in 2002 when the government concealed the existence of the illness not just from the outside world but from its own people.
UK Researcher Predicts Over 250,000 Chinese Will Have Coronavirus In 10 Days

Newspapers were forbidden from reporting the disease other than occasional statements from government officials reassuring the public there was nothing to worry about.
The state put such effort into suppressing negative headlines that when an ill traveler from Guangdong arrived in Beijing, doctors had no idea what he was suffering from.

Cities across America are on high alert amid the escalating coronavirus crisis as 63 people in 22 states are suspected to have contracted the deadly strain.
Two cases have been confirmed in the US but officials have said they expect that number to grow as dozens more people are being tested for the virus that’s sickened more than 1,400 and killed 42 in at least 12 countries.

 Exploiting a Health Crisis to Create Financial One,"In a previous articles, 5+ NWO Agendas Accompanying the Coronavirus Epidemic, I outlined the various NWO agendas being pushed out due to (or using the pretext of) the coronavirus crisis.
That was 4 weeks ago, and events are rapidly unfolding. I highlighted the lame excuses that governments were giving to advance the cashless agenda, e.g. claiming that we must take cash out of circulation because it could be spreading disease or viral fragments.
WHO (World Health Organization) Director General Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus stated that we must move towards digital money because physical paper and coin money can spread diseases, especially endemic diseases like the coronavirus.

Now, it is possible that the agenda could go even further. The Dow Jones has plummetted in recent days, including having the biggest single drop in a day since 1929 – which was the biggest stock market crash ever and the start of the Great Depression.
Ever since I have been researching the conspiracy, I have always heard whispers and predictions of a global financial crash or a global economic reset, the idea being that the international bankers would deliberately crash the economy in order to remake it in their likeness, with more centralization of power, a One World Bank and a One World Currency. Has the time finally come for them to implement this scheme?
It is still too early to say. However, in addition to the ominous signs of the stock market falling and the economy in many countries slowing or grinding to a halt (due to forced social isolations or quarantines), there are other signs.
The USG, via the Federal Reserve, is literally pumping trillions – up to a theoretical $4.5 trillion in 4 weeks starting March 12th, 2020 – into the system to keep it afloat. This is money printed out of nothing, with no economic rationale for its existence.
For the last few years, the big international banks have been feverishly preparing to launch their own digital currencies, which some people call cryptocurrencies but which are not true cryptos (the banks are obviously not interested in decentralized platforms and anonymous transactions; they want centralized control and surveillance).
They are actually CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies). There has been a banking digital arms race.
Some have suggested that SDR (Special Drawing Rights), which are IMF (International Monetary Fund) units of account pegged to a basket of currencies, could be the mechanism for the coming world currency.
Has the time come for banks to roll out their NWO One World Coin or some other digital currency?
Censorship Gone Wild
Google-owned YouTube has shown that it only requires a whiff of an excuse to censor. YouTube has begun another censorship purge.

Whereas in the past, videos were hidden, downranked or demonetized, YouTube is now taking the bold step of deleting videos entirely – such as videos that mention the word coronavirus.
Surveillance Schemes Waiting in the Wings: EARN IT
A new bill has introduced into the US Senate, named The Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (‘EARN IT’) Act. The basic premise of the bill is that tech companies will have to earn Section 230 protections rather than being granted them by default.
Section 230 is the now famous section under which Big Tech companies claim they are neutral platforms (and not publishers) and are therefore not liable for their users’ speech.
Big Tech has been openly acting as a biased publisher and selective editor/censor for years, but here’s the point: this bill is not about combatting child abuse as it ostensibly claims to be (look how slow the USG has been to go after Epstein accomplices like Ghislaine Maxwell and Andrew Windsor), but rather chipping away at the right to privacy of communication.
The News Statesman writes:
“Riana Pfefferkorn, the associate director of surveillance and cyber security at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society, wrote a blog post suggesting that this law could be a sneaky way of undermining another bit of legislation that has long been a thorn in the side of US intelligence agencies. This is the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (CALEA).
Pfefferkorn writes:
“CALEA requires telecommunications carriers (e.g., phone companies) to make their networks wiretappable for law enforcement. However, that mandate does not cover ‘information services’: websites, email, social media, chat apps, cloud storage, and so on.
“Put another way, the providers of ‘information services’ are not required to design to be surveillance-friendly … Both DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have been trying for at least a decade to close [anti-surveillance loopholes] …
“So, how can law enforcement achieve its long-desired CALEA goal? By pushing a bill that talks about Section 230 instead.””
The EFF (Electronic Frontier Foundation) writes:
“Imagine an Internet where the law required every message sent to be read by government-approved scanning software. Companies that handle such messages wouldn’t be allowed to securely encrypt them, or they’d lose legal protections that allow them to operate …
“The so-called EARN IT bill, sponsored by Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), will strip Section 230 protections away from any website that doesn’t follow a list of “best practices,” meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy.
The “best practices” list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban encryption, and guarantee law enforcement “legal access” to any digital message.” (…)
Governments More Interested in Colluding with One Another to Each Suppress Their Own Citizens, Rather Than Fighting Geopolitically
Although the realm of geopolitics and international alliances is real on one level, it’s not the deepest level at which to understand how the world is run.
On a deeper level, these nations work together, just as the USA and the USSR secretly worked together during the Cold War. There is no reason to believe it is any different now during this manufactured coronavirus crisis.
Remember, there is already evidence of Chinese government foreknowledge, as well as obvious USG/Big Pharma foreknowledge (the event 201 coronavirus simulation to start with).
As events and government responses continue to unfold, ask yourself: is there evidence of governments colluding with each other to suppress their own citizens?
Since China is the NWO technocratic and totalitarian paradigm society, will other governments use the excuse that ‘China did this and that (draconian) measure to control the virus, so we have to as well’?
Counting the Various Agendas Being Rolled Out During the Coronavirus Crisis
This list is getting longer and longer all the time:
1. Quarantine and Martial Law
2. Overturn of the Right of Freedom of Association, Right to Assemble and Right to Travel
3. Cashless Agenda
4. Global Financial Crash / Economic Reset?
5. Rolling out of Digital Currencies / One World Currency?
6. Cover for 5G Rollout
7. Surveillance
8. Censorship
9. Mandatory Vaccination
10. The Human Microchipping Agenda
Now is the time more than ever to not only boost your immune system with natural anti-viral foods and supplements, and practice good hygiene, but also to pay close attention to how the rulers are using their own manufactured coronavirus crisis to tighten their grip on power.

 Think Tank Complains “Coronavirus Is Killing Globalization as We Know It”,"The founder of a globalist think tank has written an article for Foreign Policy in which he complains that the coronavirus outbreak is “killing globalization as we know it.”
Philippe Legrain, founder of the Open Political Economy Network (OPEN) says that the spread of COVID-19 “has been a gift to nativist nationalists and protectionists.”
Legrain argues that coronavirus could be “the nail in the coffin for the current era of globalization” because it has “highlighted the downsides of extensive international integration while fanning fears of foreigners and providing legitimacy for national restrictions on global trade and flows of people.”

He adds that the crisis will have a lasting impact on undermining America’s reliance on international supply chains and provide “political fodder for nationalists who favor greater protectionism and immigration controls.”
“The coronavirus crisis threatens to usher in a less globalized world,” concludes Legrain.
“Once the pandemic and panic abate, those who believe that openness to people and products from around the world is generally a good thing will need to make the case for it in fresh and persuasive ways.”
Foreign Policy is published by The Washington Post Company (now Graham Holdings Company) and has a distinctly globalist bias.
Legrain’s point that coronavirus has provided legitimacy for restrictions of flows of people is borne out by the fact that countries like Russia and Singapore, which imposed strong border controls to stop COVID-19 back in January, have largely escaped the worst of pandemic.
In his latest column, conservative icon Pat Buchanan also highlights how coronavirus has served to expose the weaknesses of globalization.
“It may one day be said that the coronavirus delivered the deathblow to the New World Order, to a half-century of globalization and to the era of interdependence of the world’s great nations,” writes Buchanan.

" 99% of Those Who Died From Virus Had Other Illness, Italy Says","More than 99% of Italy’s coronavirus fatalities were people who suffered from previous medical conditions, according to a study by the country’s national health authority.
After deaths from the virus reached more than 2,500, with a 150% increase in the past week, health authorities have been combing through data to provide clues to help combat the spread of the disease.

Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s government is evaluating whether to extend a nationwide lockdown beyond the beginning of April, daily La Stampa reported Wednesday. Italy has more than 31,500 confirmed cases of the illness.

The new study could provide insight into why Italy’s death rate, at about 8% of total infected people, is higher than in other countries.
The Rome-based institute has examined medical records of about 18% of the country’s coronavirus fatalities, finding that just three victims, or 0.8% of the total, had no previous pathology.
Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses and about a fourth had either one or two previous conditions.
More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease.
Threat to the Elderly The median age of the infected is 63 but most of those who die are older:

The average age of those who’ve died from the virus in Italy is 79.5. As of March 17, 17 people under 50 had died from the disease. All of Italy’s victims under 40 have been males with serious existing medical conditions.
While data released Tuesday point to a slowdown in the increase of cases, with a 12.6% rise, a separate study shows Italy could be underestimating the real number of cases by testing only patients presenting symptoms.
According to the GIMBE Foundation, about 100,000 Italians have contracted the virus, daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported. That would bring back the country’s death rate closer to the global average of about 2%.

 Is Covid-19 “The Big One” Or Just A “Dry Run?”,"Let’s face facts. As viruses go, the coronavirus is likely a dud. Its mortality rate is extremely low, though its contagion factor appears to be substantial. Compared to the normal yearly death toll from the flu, Covid-19 is a spectacular no-show.
LOW MORTALITY EXCEPT FOR “USELESS EATERS”
Those who have succumbed to Covid-19, now numbering 7900 worldwide and ninety-five in the US, are largely comprised of the elderly. And the fact is that the US (and many of her Western cohorts) do not give a hoot about the old.

Why else would the US be so intent on passing euthanasia laws as well as instituting such notoriously abusive practices as court-authorized adult guardianships, which are not only devastating to a senior’s nest egg but very often fatal to the senior so afflicted?
Several years ago, the CDC, the Department of Homeland Security, Health and Human Services and some heavy weights from prestigious universities put their heads together and issued triage protocols, should an epidemic be declared.
The triage plans explicitly advised that in the case of a pandemic and limited medical resources, that the old and the sick should be denied medical treatment. Other countries, including euthanasia – happy Canada, have similar triage protocols.
So other than potentially culling some senior citizens from the Book of Life, what are the other effects of the coronavirus hysteria?
WHY A “TEST RUN?”
Apparently, this coronavirus is not “The Big One.” However, the response by governments and the UN is of such a tenor that one might think it is.
The coronavirus does provide an opportunity to test and/or refine policies and real-time effects of a contagion. These policies include quarantines, closed borders and further intrusions and violations of citizens’ privacy rights.
The effects could constitute studies of citizen compliance and market responses.
WE HAVE NO LEGAL PROTECTION FROM A STATE-SPONSORED BIOWEAPONS ATTACK
There are no real national or international legal mechanisms that would protect us from such a bioweapons test, or that would curtail the US from launching The Big One.
The toothless, dysfunctional international accord known as the Biological Weapons Convention was launched in 1975 and to this day has no enforcement or verification protocol.
We can thank the US delegation to the Convention, led by former Ambassador to the UN John Bolton, for that.
Fast forward to the anthrax attacks of 2001, handily and apparently falsely attributed to a Fort Detrick scientist who conveniently committed suicide before he could be charged.
As a result of the anthrax attacks, the US government has poured billions of dollars annually into a shadowy and unaccountable biological weapons program.
In addition, as icing on top of the anthrax cupcake, the attacks were used to change existing biological weapons laws to grant the US government immunity from violating its own prohibitions, via The Expansion of the Biological Weapons Statute, which was embedded within the USA PATRIOT Act.
Add to the mix a top secret and nearly undetectable delivery system and you’ve got a recipe for a biological weapons attack of massive proportions. Call it a pandemic and you’re almost home free.
The one remaining step would be to launch a dry run, a test to see how your world-changing mass murder event would play out in the real world. To do so without the incumbent casualties would seal the deal.
With its minimal lethality coupled with the global mechanisms now activated in response, it looks as if Covid-19 fits the profile.

 Official Story of China Epidemic Falls Apart Completely,"This is a big one.
How do experts tell the story of the origin of the China epidemic?
The story is always important. The medical professionals need to make it sound credible.
If it has major flaws, it’s as if a stage magician screws up a trick in full view of the audience. As he’s sawing a woman in a box in half, everyone sees her sneaking out of the back of the box. Busted.

That’s what’s happening in the case of the so-called China epidemic.
According to Chinese and international public health agencies, the epidemic started in Wuhan, in a hospital, with a single patient who had pneumonia. The doctors could find no cause. Soon, researchers discovered the never-before-seen coronavirus in the patient.
Really? Let’s break this down. 
The doctors couldn’t find a cause for the patient’s pneumonia. That means they didn’t locate the usual bacteria or viruses said to be responsible for pneumonia. They were puzzled.
BUT as I’ve pointed out in past articles, the city of Wuhan is famous for clouds of foul pollution. The unprecedented combination of toxic compounds in the air constitutes a clear and present danger.
Last summer, there was a large protest in the city focusing on this very issue. When lots of people take to the streets in China, you know the issue is serious — because the brutal government doesn’t take kindly to public expressions of dissatisfaction.
SO… who cares if doctors in a Wuhan hospital couldn’t find familiar bacteria or viruses in a PNEUMONIA patient? LOOK AT THE AIR POLLUTION. You want a cause for lung problems? THERE IT IS.
In other words, why would this patient be a mystery in the first place? Why would researchers look for a virus no one had ever seen before? This whole origin-story is absurd. It vibrates with ripples of FAKE.
It’s as if emergency workers bring a person into a hospital after a car accident… and the doctors are puzzled because they can’t find a bacterial explanation for the person’s injuries.
There is more. Much more.
The medical professionals had to deal with the possibility that this “new” coronavirus wasn’t new at all. Suppose it had been in the world for decades or centuries, obviously causing people no harm? If so, that would sink their ship. They couldn’t have that.
They couldn’t admit — “Oops, sorry, everyone, we made a mistake. Finding this coronavirus in people all over the world means NOTHING because, you see, it’s been around for a long, long time, and it’s never caused problems. So when we said we’ve found people who have been ‘infected’, we really mean they have this harmless virus in them.” No, no, that would never do.
Instead, the pros would have to claim the coronavirus JUST EMERGED in humans for the very first time. A FEW MONTHS AGO, it crossed over from animals (bats, snakes) to humans.
And that’s exactly what they are saying.
Here is a statement from StatNews. It’s a bit complicated, but read it over, and then I’ll comment:
“Given what’s known about the pace at which viral genomes mutate, if nCoV [the coronavirus] had been circulating in humans since significantly before the first case was reported on Dec. 8, the 24 genomes [from, presumably, 24 different samples of the virus in 24 people] would differ more.
“Applying ballpark rates of viral evolution, Rambaut [one of the “experts”] estimates that the Adam (or Eve) virus from which all others are descended first appeared no earlier than Oct. 30, 2019, and no later than Nov. 29.”
My, my. That’s quite a precise peg: the coronavirus jumped from animals to humans, for the very first time, between October 30 and November 29, 2019. The experts can assure us that it never existed in humans until that one-month period. Absurd. No one can perform such an exact analysis.
Therefore, their whole story about the human origin of the coronavirus wobbles out of the range of credibility. By miles. Whether they’re just winging it, or fabricating it, or making gross errors in bolstering their tale…there is no reason to believe anything they say about when the coronavirus surfaced in humans.
The coronavirus could have existed for a long time in humans — causing no damage or harm whatsoever.
The entire “origin story” of the “coronavirus epidemic” is riddled with exaggerations and fabrications.
Finding traces of the virus in humans and then calling these people “infected” and “carriers” and “spreaders” and “epidemic cases” is ridiculous.
Claiming the virus has spread out from Wuhan across the world is typical nonsense. The virus could have ALREADY been present in MANY different places. It didn’t spread. It was THERE.
To cite a precedent, several years ago the Zika virus was called an ominous germ that was spreading around the world, causing women to give birth to babies with smaller heads and brain damage (microcephaly).
I then reported that, according to mainstream medical sources, ANY injury to a pregnant woman could cause microcephaly. No virus necessary. And it emerged that the Zika virus had actually been discovered in…1947. It had never been known to cause harm.
In yet another fake epidemic story — this one, also a coronavirus — the SARS “epidemic” of 2003 turned out to be a dud. The official death toll, when all was said and done? 800 people out of a population of 7 billion.
And in Canada, a World Health Organization microbiologist, Frank Plummer, confessed to the press that the number of SARS patients who actually had the coronavirus in their bodies was approaching ZERO.
In other words, these patients, who had nothing more than typical flu symptoms, couldn’t have SARS, because they didn’t have the virus that was supposed to be causing SARS.
“Excuse me, waiter, I ordered dinner and you brought me a bowl of stale soggy cereal.”
“No, sir. You must be mistaken. Can’t you see the dinner on the table in front of you? We’re the experts. Leave the facts to us.”
Sorry. No sale.
Some people, reading what I’ve laid out in this article, will say, “But what about all the people who are sick in this epidemic?” Take a step back. A so-called confirmed case of the coronavirus doesn’t necessarily refer to a person who is sick.
If “tests show” a person “has the virus,” he is counted as “a case.” He may have no symptoms at all. Or he may have very mild symptoms. Most so-called cases ARE mild — and, as I’ve explained in other articles, the diagnostic tests for the coronavirus do not prove a patient’s symptoms are CAUSED by the virus.
The causes can easily come from other sources. This fact applies to anyone with any degree of illness who is called “a case of the epidemic.”
Finally, keep in mind that people all over the planet have the symptoms that are now being labeled, “China epidemic”: ordinary flu symptoms — fever, weakness, cough, headache, and lung problems. These symptoms can and do come about from a whole catalog of various reasons, none of which need “the story of the coronavirus.”
It’s as easy as pie to claim, without evidence, that someone who has these symptoms, and “tests positive for the virus,” is a “confirmed epidemic case.”
This is exactly how some of the fake epidemics ARE synthetically put together and fabricated. Form a hypothetical “cluster” of people in different locales who all have typical flu-like symptoms.
Claim they are all suffering from the direct effects of a single virus. Deploy diagnostic tests to test for the presence of the virus that — if the tests work at all — merely establish that the virus is in some of these people’s bodies.
The tests say NOTHING about whether the virus is causing harm. But gloss over that vital fact. Skip ahead and say: WE HAVE A SPREADING GLOBAL EPIDEMIC ON OUR HANDS. QUARANTINES ARE NECESSARY. WHEN WE DELIVER A VACCINE, EVERYONE MUST TAKE IT.
No.
Case unproven and therefore dismissed.

" As Americans Panic Buy Toilet Paper, Gov’t Pushing Law to Scan Every Message Online","Things are escalating quickly. Despite the need to address the growing concerns of Americans, Washington D.C. and the surveillance deep state are moving to spy on them by quietly pushing a totalitarian act of legislation.
The bipartisan supported bill, called the EARN IT bill, is sponsored by Senators Lindsay Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT).
This incredibly Draconian bill seeks to end what little privacy we have left online. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation reports, it will strip Section 230 protections away from any website that doesn’t follow a list of “best practices,” meaning those sites can be sued into bankruptcy.

The “best practices” list will be created by a government commission, headed by Attorney General Barr, who has made it very clear he would like to ban encryption, and guarantee law enforcement “legal access” to any digital message.
The authors of the bill were surreptitious in crafting its text, carefully avoiding any usage of the word “encryption” in an apparent effort to trick Americans into thinking it’s harmless.
And, last week, Blumenthal was quick to point this out — which was likely planned from the beginning.
“This bill says nothing about encryption,” Sen. Blumenthal said at Thursday’s hearing on the bill.
“Have you found a word in this bill about encryption?” he asked one witness. But the folks at EFF warn that this is a deceptive ploy.
It’s true that the bill’s authors avoided using that word. But they did propose legislation that enables an all-out assault on encryption. It would create a 19-person commission that’s completely controlled by the Attorney General and law enforcement agencies.
And, at the hearing, a Vice-President at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) made it clear [PDF] what he wants the best practices to be.
NCMEC believes online services should be made to screen their messages for material that NCMEC considers abusive; use screening technology approved by NCMEC and law enforcement; report what they find in the messages to NCMEC; and be held legally responsible for the content of messages sent by others.
You can’t have an Internet where messages are screened en masse, and also have end-to-end encryption any more than you can create backdoors that can only be used by the good guys.
The two are mutually exclusive. Concepts like “client-side scanning” aren’t a clever route around this; such scanning is just another way to break end-to-end encryption. Either the message remains private to everyone but its recipients, or it’s available to others.
The 19-person draft commission isn’t any better than the 15-person commission envisioned in an early draft of the bill. It’s completely dominated by law enforcement and allied groups like NCMEC.
Not only will those groups have a majority of votes on the commission, but the bill gives Attorney General Barr the power to veto or approve the list of best practices.
Even if other commission members do disagree with law enforcement, Barr’s veto power will put him in a position to strongarm them.
If we look at how the surveillance state abuses other regulations like this one, we can bet on seeing a level of online surveillance like never before.
It will allow law enforcement tools to erode online privacy and punish those whom with they may disagree.
If this bill passes and law enforcement gets their way with breaking encryption, as Joe Mullin points out, “authoritarian regimes around the world will rejoice, as they have the ability to add their own types of mandatory scanning, not just for child sexual abuse material but for self-expression that those governments want to suppress.”
When the government fears your privacy, that government no longer has your best interests in mind.

 10K Military Personnel From 110 Nations In Wuhan China Weeks Before Coronavirus Outbreak,"An important update regarding Wuhan China, which is ground zero for the coronavirus / Covid-19 outbreak, now reported to have gone global, as the Chinese government has now banned people in Wuhan from leaving their homes altogether.
One aspect which is very interesting and has been covered extensively here is Event 201.
The exercise simulating a global coronavirus pandemic took place on October 18th 2019 only 6 weeks before the first case of the virus was reported in Wuhan China.

What not many people are talking about is that on this exact same day, October 18th, the 2019 Military World Games held its opening ceremony followed by a U.S. men’s soccer match in Wuhan China, ground zero of the outbreak!
This report explores the possibility of a covert operation, which may have coincided with this event, using the event as cover to gain access to China, as nearly 10,000 military personnel from 110 countries were all in Wuhan China at the same time, only weeks before the outbreak began.

 Studies: Social Distancing and Early Testing Could Have Prevented 95% of All Coronavirus Cases in China,"Authorities all over the world are encouraging social distancing as a means to stop the spread of the highly contagious coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
Now, two separate studies show how the pandemic could have been slowed down when it broke out in China if social distancing practices were implemented earlier.
To see how governments can better respond to the pandemic, two separate studies have taken a look at how China initially handled it.
Both indicate that the number of infections could have been much lower — by as much as 95 percent according to one of the studies — had the country implemented social distancing earlier as asymptomatic carriers pose a much more significant risk.

As the source of the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus responsible for the outbreak, it also has the largest number of confirmed cases at over 81,000 at the time of writing.
In one of the studies, however, researchers estimated that the numbers could have been as high as 114,325 by the end of February.
Early detection and isolation more effective than travel restrictions
To take a closer look at how effective China’s containment strategy was and how it could have been better, a team at the University of Southampton in England built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infections-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China.
The model was then combined with historical and real-real-time human movement data from location-based services run by Chinese tech company Baidu.
Using the simulation, the team gauged the effectivity of the various non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies used by China, such as quarantines and social distancing.
Here, the team figured that, without the NPIs, there would have been a 67 percent increase in the number of cases.
However, the study also found that had China implemented these measures one, two or three weeks earlier, it could have reduced the number of infections 66, 86 and 95 percent, respectively. This is on top of reducing the number of areas affected by the outbreak.
What’s more interesting is that the researchers also looked at the effectivity of the individual NPIs. Of the various methods, it was early detection and isolation of cases that proved to be more effective.
This finding is in line with what’s happening in China’s close neighbor South Korea, which has largely kept its outbreak under control, thanks to a massive testing spree but no travel lockdown.
That said, the team isn’t downplaying the effects of China’s lockdowns on its cities. The team stated that a strategy of coordinated NPIs has the strongest and most rapid containment of the outbreak.
“Our study demonstrates how important it is for countries which are facing an imminent outbreak to proactively plan a coordinated response which swiftly tackles the spread of the disease on a number of fronts,” added Dr. Shengjie Lai, a research fellow at the University of Southampton and one of the authors of the study.
Undetected COVID-19 cases caused rapid spread in China
The results of the study at the University of Southampton line up with those of another study recently published in the journal Science.
This study focused on undocumented cases of COVID-19 in China and how they helped spread the infection before the authorities could contain it.
These undocumented cases consisted of people who either had only mild symptoms of the disease or no symptoms at all.
According to researchers at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health who conducted the study, these cases can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur.
To asses the full epidemic potential of the coronavirus, the team used a computer model to estimate the proportion and contagiousness of these undocumented cases during the weeks before and after China’s lockdown of the city of Wuhan.
In this model, the spread of the coronavirus across cities was then simulated using the mobility data collected by Chinese form Tencent from January 10 to 23 and January 24 to February 8.
Using the numbers extrapolated from the model, the researchers at Columbia found that 86 percent of all infections were undocumented before travel in and out of Wuhan was shut down on January 23.
The researchers say that these undocumented infections were more than half as contagious as documented infections. However, they were still the source for over two-thirds of the documented infections.
“The explosion of COVID-19 cases in China was largely driven by individuals with mild, limited, or no symptoms who went undetected,” stated co-author Jeffrey Shaman, professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University Mailman School.
“These stealth transmissions will continue to present a major challenge to the containment of this outbreak going forward,” Shaman added.
In late January, China implemented a number of measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus, including implementing lockdowns of cities such as Wuhan.
The researchers acknowledged that these, alongside the public’s heightened awareness of the outbreak and increased use of personal protective measures, have helped slow the outbreak down.
Coronavirus could become endemic, and return like seasonal flu
Despite the measures implemented by China, the number of undocumented cases and their effectivity at spreading the virus has made the researchers question whether or not efforts by the Chinese government would be enough to contain the spread of the virus entirely.
Shaman said that he felt it was unclear whether the reductions made by China’s efforts would be enough to fully stem the spread of the coronavirus.
He then likened the ongoing pandemic to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Also known as the “swine flu,” the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated this pandemic killed around 284,500 people.
Shaman then stated that the COVID-19 pandemic, which has only killed 3,213 as of the time of writing, would end up following the pattern of the swine flu pandemic, which would make it the fifth endemic coronavirus in humans.
The four current endemic coronaviruses, including the two responsible for the 2003 to 2004 SARS outbreak, are currently responsible for an estimated one-quarter of all colds.
If this new one does join them as the fifth, then COVID-19 could repeatedly return like the seasonal flu.
“This is going to be with us for some time – it’s endemic in human populations and not going to go away without a vaccine,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, earlier this month.
Adalja also warned that the early spread of the coronavirus in the U.S. could have been facilitated by it being mistaken as seasonal flu, resulting in people not getting tested.
With the new studies then, the scientists are hoping that the mistakes in China aren’t continued in other countries and that the early, undocumented spread of the disease is arrested through early testing and social distancing.
That, and if the coronavirus ever returns seasonally in the future, health officials are better prepared to deal with it.

 This Scientist Suggested A Drug to Treat Covid-19 – ‘Fact Checkers’ Branded Him Fake News,"Amid a pandemic panic over the coronavirus, evidence for a possibly effective treatment has been denounced as ‘fake news’ – even when offered by a renowned scientist with decades of experience.
Take Didier Raoult, a French microbiologist with undeniable expertise, even if some of his views are about as eccentric as his appearance.
Though he may look like he just stepped out of an Alexandre Dumas novel, the director of the Mediterranean University Hospital Institute in Marseille cited not one but three different studies from China showing that the anti-malaria drug called chloroquine has been effective in treating Covid-19 patients.
That did not stop Le Monde, France’s biggest newspaper, of declaring his February 25 video as “partially false.”
Raoult’s ‘sin’ was to argue that the common anti-malaria drug used widely for decades resulted in “dramatic improvements” among those afflicted by the virus.
#chloroquine Pr Didier Raoult : «C'est quand les patients ont des formes modérées, moyennes, ou qui commencent à s'aggraver, qu'il faut les traiter. A ce moment là on contrôle les virus qui se multiplient. Quand ils sont rentrés en réanimation, le problème ce n'est plus le virus» pic.twitter.com/WolGe2o05z
— Alex (@AlexLeroy90) March 25, 2020

As a result of Le Monde’s fact-check, anyone attempting to share Dr. Raoult’s videos on Facebook gets a banner saying the information therein was “partially false” as “determined by independent fact-checkers.”
The main argument put forward by those critical of the drug is that more testing is required before it can be officially approved as treatment for the coronavirus.
As the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) puts it, “There are no currently available data from Randomized Clinical Trials… to inform clinical guidance on the use, dosing, or duration of hydroxychloroquine” treatments for Covid-19.
Which is fair enough, but last time I checked, there was a pandemic going on, with billions of people locked in their homes and all business grinding to a halt across the globe, over apocalyptic predictions of hospitals brimming with corpses due to this coronavirus.
Should any kind of treatment – especially a drug that has been used safely for decades to treat something else, with side effects meticulously documented – be so cavalierly rejected, under the circumstances?
Do “experts” really think the world has the luxury of waiting for months or even years for their controlled lab studies?
As for the fact-checkers, shouldn’t they have applied the same rigor to the models used to scare everyone into hoarding toilet paper and setting off a depression orders of magnitude worse than anything the world has ever seen?
To ask these questions is to answer them, yet no one seems to bother. Nor is this sort of selective blindness endemic to France; across the Atlantic, the mainstream media raised their voices in unison against chloroquine after US President Donald Trump brought it up as a possible treatment – apparently referring to Dr. Raoult’s work.
They went so far as to widely circulate a deliberately misleading story about an Arizona couple that ate fish tank cleaner – chloroquine phosphate, clearly labeled not for human consumption – as somehow Trump’s fault.
Some of them quietly amended it to specify the difference, but long after the original story – implying they took the actual medication praised by the president – literally went viral and poisoned the minds of millions.
Worse yet, as a result of this media blitz, the governor of Nevada actually banned using chloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients this week, saying there was “no consensus among experts or Nevada doctors” that the anti-malaria drug can treat coronavirus sufferers.
There were no angry editorials denouncing Steve Sisolak, a Democrat, for letting people die or the coronavirus rather than have them treated with a drug endorsed by the Republican president and the media’s favorite hate object.
One would think the world paralyzed with fear of the invisible death would pounce on every possible solution, no matter how unlikely it seems.
That’s what we’re shown in Hollywood disaster movies, after all. Yet when such a solution presents itself, it is dismissed and denounced as “not proven”!
We’re supposed to blindly trust apocalyptic models produced by panic-mongering political hacks, but ignore the man who says the drug brought him back from the brink of death, even though his story can be easily verified and theirs cannot.
“Preferring opinions to facts is a disease,” Dr. Raoult told the French magazine Marianne last week. Just so.
I don’t know if hydroxychloroquine works on Covid-19. Dr. Raoult seems to believe so, and he’s not alone. In the absence of better solutions – and locking billions of people in their homes indefinitely is not one – don’t we owe humanity to at least try? What do we have to lose?
In the three months or so since the coronavirus first appeared in China, there has been a lot of conflicting, confusing and outright false information about it.
One thing that has consistently proven true, however, is that the biggest obstacle in effectively battling its spread and treating the afflicted has been the obtuse insistence of the political and medical establishment on blindly following their rules.
If the virus is truly threatening to kill millions, as they say, they would not value procedures over saving lives. Nevertheless, they persist. It makes one wonder why.
