Doctor: White House has my '100% successful' coronavirus treatment,"Dr. Vladimir Zelenko (Facebook)
A recent survivor of an extremely rare cancer with a ""100% mortality rate"" that took one of his lungs, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko says he shouldn't be alive.

But now, a simple cocktail of three cheap, proven, widely available drugs his medical team has used to successfully treat at least 500 patients with the coronavirus is offering hope as the pandemic grows exponentially in his area of greater New York City.
The treatment now has the attention of the White House and Israel's Ministry of Health, among others, Zelenko told WND in a phone interview Wednesday morning.
""I was actually wondering why God spared me,"" said Zelenko, who noted he hasn't slept in the past four days.

It's an out-patient treatment combining the common anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine with the popular antibotic azithromycin (known as Z-Pak) and zinc sulfate.
Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C.

Zelenko, 46, told WND he is in direct communication with Mark Meadows, the North Carolina congressman who has been tapped by President Trump to become the next White House chief of staff.
""I don't know if the president saw [the protocols], but they were presented to whoever they needed to be presented to,"" he said.
""I know for a fact that my protocols are now at the Ministry of Health in Israel and that the government is considering adopting them.""
On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the FDA has approved the use of hydroxychloroquine experimentally for any coronavirus patient while clinical trials commence.
In a video widely distributed Tuesday on social media, Zelenko said he treated 350 patients for COVID-19 with 100% success. Since then, among an even higher sample, one person he treated has been hospitalized, he told WND.

""So, it's not 100%,"" he said, ""but nothing in life is 100%.""
""I'm not claiming any miracles here,"" Zelenko said. ""All I did was take established remedies and modify the dosage slightly, based on data from studies in France and the Far East.""
'We need to treat the world'
A once-irreligious Jew from Russia, Zelenko is now an observant member of the 30,000-strong Hasidic community of Kiryas Joel in Monroe, New York, in the Hudson Valley, about 50 miles north of New York City.

Zelenko is taking his coronavirus treatment himself as a prophylatic as he directs his medical team from quarantine at home because of his lung loss and ongoing oral cancer treatment.
But their target is any patient with shortness of breath or other symptoms that put them in the high-risk category in which the mortality rate is 6% to 10%.
The key, he said, is when to use the treatment.
""It's the combination of these three drugs given earlier rather than later seems to make a significant difference,"" he said.

Zelenko explained that there are two different diseases, the COVID-19 infection and the catastrophic lung injury, called acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS.
ARDS is the affliction requiring the use of hospital beds and ventilators, which has become a hot political issue because of the severe lack of supply.
His protocol won't treat ARDS, but it can keep people from ever developing it.
""I believe it lowers the viral load and decreases the amount of virus that the immune system needs to deal with,"" he said. ""It gives it time to overcome the development of the infection prior to development of ARDS or lung injury.""

Zelenko said the results are ""remarkable.""
""I'm seeing respiratory symptoms resolve as fast as four hours. That's not the norm,"" he said. ""It takes 12 hours on average, in my experience.
""But I've seen remarkable results, and I have now colleagues who are implementing this as well and they are reporting the same anecdotal data.""
The colleagues include Dr. William Grace of the hematology and oncology department at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

""He is in complete agreement with my protocols, and he also describes significant improvement anecdotally,"" Zelenko said.
Another is Dr. Rosy Joseph, a nephrologist in Hackensack, New Jersey, who says she is using the protocols with success.
""These drugs are well known, they're old,"" Zelenko said. ""We know their side-effect protocols, which is relatively low. And they're cheap.
""That's very important, because we need to treat the world,"" he emphasized.

""They're developing these fancy treatments, but they're going to cost $10,000 a pop,"" he said. ""It's not going to work.""
His treatment, he said, is ""just repurposing old drugs in the right combination in an outpatient setting.""
""I think that's the solution to this problem,"" he told WND. ""We need more ventilators, but the key is to reduce the patients that need ventilators.""
Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, was asked in an interview Tuesday with Philadelphia AM 990's The Answer whether or not he would prescribe chlorquine as a treatment for the coronavirus.

""Yeah, of course, particularly if people have no other option. You want to give them hope,"" said Fauci, the director the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""In fact, for physicians in this country, these drugs are approved drugs for other reasons. They're anti-malaria drugs and they're drugs against certain autoimmune diseases, like lupus.""
Virus killer
Zelenko pointed to a study in South Korea that found success in the combination of zinc and hydroxychloroquine.
Zinc is a virus killer, but the replication of the virus prevents it from getting into the cell.

""Hydroxychloroquine opens the door and lets the zinc in,"" he explained. ""The zinc goes inside the cell and wreaks havoc on the virus.""
Meanwhile, a study from France showed success combining hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin.
""I'm not sure why that works,"" Zelenko said. ""I postulate it prevents secondary bacterial infection. When someone is overwhelmed with a virus, they become more susceptible to opportunistic infections. I suspect that with the antibiotic on board, it minimizes the risk of complications.
""So, I figure, let's combine the three of them together,"" he said. ""Z-Pak is so common, everyone knows about it.""

Hydroxychloroquine is less known, but it's used for malaria and in rheumatology to treat diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.
""I've had experience with it, so it's a very comfortable drug to use,"" Zelenko told WND.
He said there is a slight risk of a heart arrhythmia issue, ""but everything in life is risk versus benefit analysis.""
""I don't treat healthy young people with no shortness of breath, because they are going to get better,"" he said. ""So why would I take the risk?
Advertisement - story continues below
""But if someone has a 6 to 10% chance of dying, you'd better believe I'm going to give it to them.""
'A foot and a half in the grave'
WND asked Zelenko how the whirlwind of the last 48 hours has affected him personally.
""I'll give you an honest answer,"" he said. ""Two years ago, I was diagnosed with pulmonary artery sarcoma. It has a 100% mortality rate. I ended up having open heart surgery and lost my right lung. I went on very difficult chemo. And I'm still on oral chemotherapy.
Advertisement - story continues below
""The fact that I'm alive is statistically improbable,"" he said. ""There are only about 10 cases in the world a year of what I had, and they all ended with an autopsy.
""The reason I'm telling you this is that public accolades mean nothing to me. After you have a foot and a half in the grave, and then you're spared ... I was actually wondering why God spared me.""
Zelenko noted he's the father of eight children who treats a community of more than 30,000 people.
""My purpose in life has really become to try to relieve pain and suffering. Not to think about myself,"" he said. ""I haven't slept in like four days and try to help as many people as I can.""

But he does ""have skin in the game.""
""I do want to live, and if I get this infection, it's not so good for me,"" he said. ""I only have one lung. I have children, I have parents. It's also personal.""

WAPO: Trump furious after officials let Americans with coronavirus return to U.S. from Japan,"(CNN) President Donald Trump became enraged with senior advisers this week when 14 Americans who tested positive for the coronavirus were brought back to the US from Japan after he had been told they would remain quarantined overseas, administration officials told The Washington Post.

The President was first told that Americans who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where the coronavirus has spread, would be flown back to the US on two planes but that patients with the infection or with symptoms would stay in Japan, where the ship is anchored, the newspaper reported.

However, the State Department and a US health official decided to bring back the infected Americans on the planes and place them in isolation without telling the President, the Post said.

Dr. Drew blasts media for looking to 'fan the flames of panic' with coronavirus coverage,"TV personality Dr. Drew Pinsky told Fox News he thinks the establishment media are intentionally inciting fear over the spread of the coronavirus from China.
Pinsky appeared on “Fox & Friends” Friday morning to discuss the potentially deadly infectious disease.

Dr. Drew told co-hosts Steve Doocy, Jedediah Bila and Pete Hegseth he thinks the establishment media are going to “great lengths” to stigmatize the virus and manipulate viewers into becoming fearful.
“The media continues to take every effort to fan the flames of panic,” the practicing physician said.
""A local news agency in Los Angeles had ... footage of a paramedic being dispatched to a cruise ship repeatedly all evening,” he said.

""At the end, they go, 'Oh, by the way, there was a fight on a cruise ship. Somebody got injured,'"" Pinsky said.
According to Pinsky, people should be prepared to deal with the infection but “the panic is far worse than the virus.”

""Let the professionals whose job it is to contain pandemic do their job,"" he said.
Pinsky praised global health authorities for doing “an amazing job” in dealing with coronavirus response.
“Worldwide, the efforts and effect of the organizations like the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and the World Health Organization has been remarkable,” he said.
""Look, the WHO has said there's about a 3 percent fatality rate on this virus, and every time they say that they always qualify it and say, 'We expect it to drop a lot once we understand the full extent of the virus,'” Pinsky continued.

The coronavirus is “amongst us,” he said, adding, “This is a flu season, everybody. There are 18,000 deaths from the flu.
""Why aren't we worried about that? Why isn't the message: Get your flu shot? You're much more likely to die of the flu than the coronavirus.""
While he said the coronavirus is not the flu, he cautioned Fox viewers that they should approach the coronavirus in the same manner in which they would prepare to prevent contracting influenza.
Pinsky advised people to wash their hands, keep disinfectant wipes available and get a flu shot.

“Do all the things you're supposed to do in flu season,"" he said.
Pinsky later took questions on Twitter from followers concerned about the virus during a live Periscope broadcast. In the broadcast, Pinsky said establishment journalists should be ""called out"" for their ""irresponsible"" reporting about the virus.
""People are going to lose their jobs and be hurt by this,"" he said of the panic, which is leading many people to stay indoors.

"Amazon looks to hire 100,000 new workers amid coronavirus pandemic","As retail stores close or restrict hours as part of the nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak, opportunity knocks for Americans at Amazon.
The online retailer is planning to hire 100,000 more employees to cope with the expected spike in demand as consumers who either will not or cannot go to a store do their shopping online.

Amazon Senior Vice President of Worldwide Operations Dave Clark announced the hirings in a Monday blog post.
""As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, Amazon and our network of partners are helping communities around the world in a way that very few can—delivering critical supplies directly to the doorsteps of people who need them,"" he wrote.
""Getting a priority item to your doorstep is vital as communities practice social-distancing, particularly for the elderly and others with underlying health issues. We are seeing a significant increase in demand, which means our labor needs are unprecedented for this time of year.""

According to Clark, Amazon will have both full-time and part-time openings.
""We are opening 100,000 new full and part-time positions across the U.S. in our fulfillment centers and delivery network to meet the surge in demand from people relying on Amazon’s service during this stressful time, particularly those most vulnerable to being out in public,"" he wrote.

""We also know many people have been economically impacted as jobs in areas like hospitality, restaurants, and travel are lost or furloughed as part of this crisis. We want those people to know we welcome them on our teams until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back.""
Many Amazon employees will also be getting a raise.
""In the U.S., we will be adding an additional $2 USD per hour worked through April from our current rate of $15/hour or more, depending on the region, £2 per hour in the UK, and approximately €2 per hour in many EU countries. This commitment to increased pay through the end of April represents an investment of over $350 million in increased compensation for hourly employees across the U.S., Europe, and Canada,"" Clark wrote.
The company also announced the creation of a $25-million relief fund to support workers and their families impacted by the outbreak.
Amazon has also increased cleaning at all sites, CNBC reported.

The company now requires that employees sanitize and clean work stations and vehicles before and after each shift.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said millions of American workers will have their jobs impacted by the virus through changes in consumer behavior, according to CNN.
""People are going to be buying less of everything. The stock market is down and wiping out people's nest eggs,"" Zandi said. ""They're worried 'Am I going to get sick? Are my parents going to get sick?' That's a prescription for people going into the bunker and for job losses.""
Zandi said small businesses are likely to face the toughest going.

Medical professor praises Trump for coronavirus response: 'I've never seen one handled better',"A medical expert is praising the Trump administration for its response to the coronavirus, while slamming the news media for its actions.
“I’ve been handling these emerging contagions for about 20 years now, and I have to tell you, I’ve never seen one handled better,” Dr. Marc Siegel said regarding the actions of President Donald Trump since the coronavirus first emerged as a concern in January.
Advertisement - story continues below
Siegel is a professor of medicine at New York University, a medical correspondent for Fox News, and the author of ""False Alarm: The Truth About the Epidemic of Fear.""
Asked on SiriusXM’s ""Breitbart News Sunday"" about how the news media has handled the outbreak, he said, “They’re certainly not helping because they’re hyping, and the hyping leads to hysteria.""
Siegel said the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force brings together the right people.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

“The task force are really top players,” said Siegel, noting the inclusion of Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Fauci is “one of the top infectious disease experts in the country,” he noted.
“They’ve been doing exactly what they’re supposed to be doing,” he said, listing actions Trump has called for such as “restricting travel, isolating patients who are sick and, trying to cut down on contact. It’s a very hard thing to do when people are pouring in from all over the world.”
Advertisement - story continues below
CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, a virologist, and Dr. Nancy Messonnier, an expert in vaccines who has been sounding the alarm about the virus, are also important members, he said, though he believes the “doom and gloom comment” about the inevitable spread of the virus was uncalled for.
Siegel said that the coronavirus is different from diseases such as SARS or the flu.
“SARS had about a ten percent mortality [rate], but it only affected about 8,000 people. Swine flu had a very, very low mortality for flu, but flu itself really only causes about a point-four percent death rate, and [coronavirus] is about one-point-four percent. So this is killing more than flu, but I want to make a couple of points that will reassure people,"" he said.
“One, at the beginning of an emerging contagion, it always appears more deadly than it actually is. The 1918 flu is an exception, but normally as time goes on, it’s less deadly, and part of that is because you see more immunity appearing, and you also find a lot of milder cases -- or even cases where people don’t get sick at all. You find that as you start to test more people,"" he said.
He also noted that people who were infected but never got sick do not show up in statistics, making the virus seem more deadly than it is.

Health officials have tried to put the disease in context.
"" I just want to echo again that the risk is low -- the risk is low. I encourage Americans to go about their life. That includes travel to California, Oregon, and the state of Washington,"" Redfield said Saturday at a media event announcing the first death from the virus in the U.S., according to a White House media pool report
Fauci said that infection is not tantamount to death.
""If you look at the totality of the cases that have been reported, particularly from China, about 75 to 80 percent of them would do really quite well. They would just sort of like a bad flu or a cold. You get anywhere from 15 to 20, 20-some-odd percent who are going to go on to require advanced medical care -- hospitalization, possibly intensive care,"" he said. ""For the most part, the people who get in trouble and ultimately, tragically, would die from this are people who are elderly and/or have underlying conditions: heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes, obesity, because of the difficulty in breathing back and forth.
Advertisement - story continues below
""However, every once in a while, you're going to see a one-off, you're going to see a 25-year-old person, who looks otherwise well, that's going to get seriously ill. But the vast majority of the people who get into trouble do have these underlying conditions And that's why it confuses people, because they say, 'Well, you just said that, and then there's a report of a 40-year-old physician from China who died.' That's going to happen,"" he said.
""That happens with influenza. Most of the time, influenza kills people who are advanced age and underlying conditions. But you hear in the media, every once in a while, a college student would get infected and ultimately die. But the majority is in that risk group,"" he said.

By Peter Hasson
Daily Caller News Foundation
Former Vice President Joe Biden has repeatedly pushed misinformation about the COVID-19 coronavirus in political attacks against President Donald Trump and his administration.
Biden, the Democratic frontrunner for president, has sought to politically capitalize on the coronavirus pandemic. But on at least five different occasions, Biden and his campaign have spread misinformation about the response to the virus.

Biden falsely said Trump slashed the CDC budget
Biden was dinged by fact-checkers after he falsely accused Trump of cutting the budget for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Advertisement - story continues below
“We increased the budget of the CDC. We increased the NIH budget. … He’s wiped all that out. … He cut the funding for the entire effort,” Biden said at the Feb. 26 debate. Former 2020 Democratic candidate Mike Bloomberg made a similarly false accusation during the debate.
“They’re both wrong to say the agencies have seen their money cut,” the AP noted in a fact-check of the comments.
Biden falsely said Trump rejected WHO tests
Biden falsely said that Trump rejected coronavirus tests from the World Health Organization (WHO).
“The World Health Organization offered the testing kits that they have available and to give it to us now. We refused them. We did not want to buy them,” Biden stated during the March 15 Democratic debate. But that wasn’t true.

“The WHO never offered to sell test kits to the United States,” PolitiFact said in its fact-check of Biden’s comments.
Biden campaign video falsely said Trump called virus a “hoax”
Biden spread the false claim that Trump referred to the virus as a “hoax” at his Feb. 28 campaign rally in South Carolina.
On March 3, Biden tweeted a video that misleadingly spliced together Trump saying “coronavirus” followed by, “this is their new hoax.”
Advertisement - story continues below
In reality, Trump said that Democrats’ political reaction to the virus was a “hoax.”
“The video makes it seem like Trump is calling the disease itself a hoax, which he hasn’t done. The words are Trump’s, but the editing is Biden’s,” PolitiFact noted, rating the claim “false.”
Biden’s campaign falsely accused Trump of silencing a CDC official
Biden’s campaign produced a video falsely accusing Trump of silencing a CDC official who warned the public about coronavirus. But that wasn’t true at all, as The Washington Post noted in a fact-check.
Advertisement - story continues below
In the video, Biden campaign adviser Ron Klain claimed the Trump administration silenced career CDC official Nancy Messonnier. Klain claimed that Messonnier had been sidelined from briefing reporters after delivering a widely discussed warning about the virus’s impact on Americans’ lives.
“But Klain’s framing of the Messonnier situation is simply wrong,” the Post’s fact-check noted, adding that Messonnier continued briefing reporters for weeks after the statement in question. The Post awarded four out of four Pinocchios to the Biden campaign’s false claim.
Biden falsely said he hasn’t criticized the president’s coronavirus response
Biden falsely said Tuesday on “The View” that he hasn’t criticized Trump on coronavirus.

“I’ve not been criticizing the president, but I’ve been pointing out where there’s disagreement as to how to proceed,” Biden asserted. “The coronavirus is not his fault, but the lack of speed and alacrity with which to respond to it has to move much faster.”
Biden was sharply critical of Trump before his appearance on “The View,” and he’s continued launching criticism after the interview.
“Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks,” Biden wrote in a tweet Tuesday afternoon.
Biden’s campaign didn’t return a request for comment for this article.

Will the FDA approve chloroquine to treat coronavirus?,"Something rather remarkable has occurred just recently regarding the Chinese/Wuhan coronavirus. And yes, I said it. Go ahead and call me a racist if you wish.
A treatment has been developed that shows promise at stopping the virus in virtually all patients for whom it's been administered.
Advertisement - story continues below
Early tests suggest that it can stop the virus from being contagious in just six days, with little to no side effects.
This is a huge breakthrough that's happened in no time flat.
I stress that this appears effective as a treatment. It is not a vaccine, but if it's as effective as advertized, it will buy the time needed to develop one.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Professor Didier Raoult from infection hospital l'Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire (IHU) Méditerranée Infection in Marseille, France, said that, ""the first COVID-19 patients he had treated with the drug chloroquine had seen a rapid and effective speeding up of their healing process, and a sharp decrease in the amount of time they remained contagious.""
Chloroquine is a drug that's been around since 1945 and was originally developed to prevent and treat malaria.
Advertisement - story continues below
Interestingly, virtually the same drug, Chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine, have been and are being used in China and Korea with similar results. This appears too unlikely to be coincidental, but there doesn't appear to be collaboration between the Chinese, the South Koreans and the French.
However, in my opinion, there must be something there.
Whatever the case, it may be the reason why the Chinese have announced such a rapid turnaround, and drastic lessoning of reported cases and deaths.
And it also may be the reason Great Britain has banned the export of any stockpiles of the drug. The word is evidently getting out.
Recall the New Jersey physician's assistant, James Cai, who contracted coronavirus. After his doctors consulted with Chinese physicians, he was given a combination of chloroquine and the HIV drug Kaletra. He is now recovering, but says that without this treatment he would have ""been a goner.""
Advertisement - story continues below
So what about this anti-malarial drug chloroquine? There may be a problem. It's a drug that was approved only for malaria, not for COVID-19.
Without specific approval, will our beneficent FDA just allow its use for an entirely new and different purpose?
Over the years the United States Food and Drug Administration has received a well deserved bad rap when it comes to drug treatment approvals.
It can take years for the agency to approve medications, and in many cases, patients have died waiting for approval.

Will President Trump's signing of the ""Right to Try Act"" into law in 2018 make a difference this time around, or will it be FDA business as usual?
For those unfamiliar, in a nut shell, the Right to Try law gives only terminally ill patients the option to accept treatment of experimental drugs. The thought is that these patients stand little chance of survival anyway, so why not let them at least try something new, whether it's been yet blessed by the almighty FDA or not.
However, not just anything can be tried. A patient couldn't legally suggest that his doctor administer the latest voodoo cure or Shaman remedy. The treatment would at least have to have passed ""phase 1"" clinical trials at the FDA.
Knowing this, the president has made a pitch to the FDA to allow the use of chloroquine for treatment of COVID-19.
Advertisement - story continues below
The jury is still out on what they will decide: ""That's a drug [chloroquine] that the president has directed us to take a closer look at as to whether an expanded use approach to that could be done to actually see if that benefits patients,"" FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said.
Doesn't sound like a yes to me, despite the mounting international evidence in the drugs favor.

Will coronavirus kill the New World Order?,"Dr. Brian Monahan, attending physician of Congress, told a closed meeting of Senate staffers this week that 70 million to 150 million Americans – a third of the nation – could contract the coronavirus. Dr. Anthony Fauci testified that the mortality rate for COVID-19 will likely run near 1%.
Translation: Between 750,000 and 1.1 million Americans may die of this disease before it runs its course. The latter figure is equal to all the U.S. dead in World War II and on both sides in the Civil War.

Chancellor Angela Merkel warns that 70% of Germany's population – 58 million people – could contract the coronavirus. If she is right, and Fauci's mortality rate holds for her country, that could mean more than half a million dead Germans.
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis called Merkel's remark ""unhelpful"" and said it could cause panic. But Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch seemed to support Merkel, saying between 40% and 70% of the world's population could become infected.
Again, if Fauci's 1% mortality rate and Lipsitch's estimate prove on target, between 3 billion and 5 billion people on earth will be infected, and 30 million to 50 million will die, a death toll greater than that of the Spanish Flu of 1918.

There is, however, some contradictory news. 
China, with 81,000 cases, has noted a deceleration in new cases, and South Korea appears to be gradually containing the spread of the virus.

Yet, Italy, with its large elderly population, may be a harbinger of what is to come in the West.
As of Thursday, Italy had reported 12,000 cases and 827 deaths, a mortality rate of nearly 7%. This suggests that the unreported and undetected infections in shutdown Italy are far more numerous. 
In the U.S., the death toll at this writing is 39, a tiny fraction of the annual toll of tens of thousands who die of the flu.
But the problem is this: COVID-19 has not nearly run its course in the USA, while the reaction in society and the economy approaches what we might expect from a boiling national disaster.
The stock market has plunged further and faster than it did in the Great Crash of 1929. Trillions of dollars in wealth have vanished. If Sen. Bernie Sanders does not like ""millionaires and billionaires,"" he should be pleased. There are far fewer of them today than there were when he won the New Hampshire primary.

What does the future hold?
It may one day be said that the coronavirus delivered the deathblow to the New World Order, to a half-century of globalization and to the era of interdependence of the world's great nations. 
Tourism, air travel, vacation cruises, international gatherings and festivals are already shutting down. Travel bans between countries and continents are being imposed. Conventions, concerts and sporting events are being canceled. Will the Tokyo Olympics go forward? If they do, will all the anticipated visitors from abroad come to Japan to enjoy the games?
Trump has issued a one-month travel ban on Europe.

As for the ""open borders"" crowd, do Democrats still believe that breaking into our country should no longer be a crime, and immigrants arriving illegally should be given free health care, a proposition to which all the Democratic debaters raised their hands?
The ideological roots of our free trade era can be traced to the mid-19th century when its great evangelist, Richard Cobden, rose at Free Trade Hall in Manchester on Jan. 15, 1846, and rhapsodized:
""I see in the Free Trade principle that which shall act on the moral world as the principle of gravitation in the universe – drawing men together, thrusting aside the antagonism of race, and creed, and language, and uniting us in the bonds of eternal peace.""
In the pre-Trump era, Republicans held hands with liberal Democrats in embracing NAFTA, GATT, the WTO and most-favored-nation trade privileges for China.

In retrospect, was it wise to have relied on China to produce essential parts for the supply chains of goods vital to our national security? Does it appear wise to have moved the production of pharmaceuticals and lifesaving drugs for heart disease, strokes and diabetes to China? Does it appear wise to have allowed China to develop a virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals crucial to the development of weapons for our defense?
In this coronavirus pandemic, people now seem to be looking for authoritative leaders, and nations seem to be looking out for their own peoples first. Would Merkel, today, invite a million Syrian refugees into Germany no matter the conditions under which they were living in Syria and Turkey?
Is not the case now conclusive that we made a historic mistake when we outsourced our economic independence to rely for vital necessities upon nations that have never had America's best interests at heart?
Which rings truer today? We are all part of mankind, all citizens of the world. Or that it's time to put America and Americans first!

As of Wednesday, Chinese officials said 132 people had died from the virus and about 6,000 cases had been confirmed, according to The New York Times.
To date, all deaths from the virus have taken place in China. There have been five confirmed cases of the virus in the U.S.

Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Tuesday the U.S. offered on Jan. 6 to send a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team to China to help deal with the outbreak.
China never accepted the offer, but on Tuesday agreed to accept a World Health Organization team, according to The Washington Post.
Warren's plan was released less than a week before the Iowa caucuses, where the first votes will be cast for the Democratic candidates hoping to be the party's presidential nominee.
The Massachusetts progressive is currently fourth in the RealClearPolitics average of polls in that state, trailing Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
In her plan to stop the spread of infectious diseases, Warren hit at Trump for failing to fill all positions in the sprawling federal bureaucracy as well as for not falling in line with the Paris accords aimed at responding to climate change.
""Trump has repeatedly tried to nickel and dime federal programs essential to health security,"" Warren charged in her plan, also claiming that Trump's ""response to natural disasters that could lead to serious outbreaks, like hurricanes in Puerto Rico, has been basically non-existent. ""
Advertisement - story continues below
""On the global stage, his decision to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement demonstrates reckless denial about the role of climate change in fueling epidemics. His foreign policy has damaged long-standing alliances with partners like the U.K. and France, who are critical partners in responding to global health crises,"" she said.
Warren's plan said a collection of approaches that puts more money into the State Department and global health organizations, embraces ""Medicare for All"" and invests in the Green Climate Fund will reduce the spread of infectious diseases.
She also said that as president, she will be the champion of those who others ignored.
""Underserved and disadvantaged populations are hit harder by outbreaks,"" she said. ""Adding insult to injury, vulnerable populations are often scapegoated for spreading disease. Outbreak responses must ensure that everyone can get the help they need.""

“Diseases like coronavirus remind us why we need robust international institutions, strong investments in public health, and a government that is prepared to jump into action at a moment’s notice,” Warren said in her plan.
“When we prepare and effectively collaborate to address common threats that don’t stop at borders, the international community can stop these diseases in their tracks.”

"As coronavirus fear grips U.S., bottles of hand sanitizer go on sale for $600 online","Complaints of price gouging on items related to coronavirus prevention are now emerging as sellers try to maximize how much they can make off of panic-stricken customers.
“No one should be allowed to reap a windfall from fear and human suffering,” Democratic Sen. Edward Markey of Massachusetts wrote in a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, citing media accounts that a $10 package of Purel brand hand sanitizer bottles was being sold on Amazon for as much as $400 and that a package of 20 surgical masks that routinely sold for $14.99 was for sale for $387.

Reuters reported that on Wednesday, a bottle of the brand was selling for $600.
“Internet-based retailers such as Amazon.com have a particular responsibility to guard against price gouging in current circumstances as consumers — who are finding the shelves of local brick-and-mortar stores bare, and who may wish to avoid venturing into crowded stores and shopping malls — turn to the internet,"" Markey wrote.
Amazon said it is on the lookout for sellers taking capitalism a step too far.

“We agree with Senator Markey—there is no place for price gouging on Amazon and that’s why our teams are monitoring our store 24/7 and have already removed tens of thousands of offers for attempted price gouging,” a company representative said, according to The Hill. “We are disappointed that bad actors are attempting to take advantage of this global health crisis and, in addition to removing these offers, we are terminating accounts.”
Complaints have risen to the point where President Donald Trump, in a Saturday news conference, said that the federal coronavirus task force would investigate reports of price gouging.

Some experts said that while governments might try to limit the extent of price gouging, a rise in prices for items that suddenly have value is basic economics.
""Ideally, we would find a mechanism for making sure that those who are likely to be most vulnerable to the crisis such as the elderly and health workers get the available supplies. But laws that prevent prices from rising will not accomplish that goal,"" Michael Salinger, an economics professor at Boston University's Questrom School of Business, said, according to USA Today.

“These higher prices reward suppliers ready to meet that surge in demand either from existing stocks or by quickly ramping up production,” said Michael Giberson, an economics professor at Texas Tech University’s Rawls College of Business.
One commentator said technology also plays a role in price increases, noting that in the world of e-commerce, some algorithms adjust pricing to rise with demand.
“Retailers who practice dynamic pricing need to monitor algorithms to ensure that prices don’t skyrocket,” Kelly Lynch, retail solutions manager at ActiveViam, which provides pricing technology, said, according to Forbes.
Dana Radcliffe, senior lecturer of business ethics at Cornell’s SC Johnson College of Business, said that arguments that hold true in normal times do not in emergencies.

“In emergencies where critical supplies are scarce, the conditions of a ‘free and fair market’ don’t exist — since the buyers don’t have options,"" he said.
“They cannot simply buy at lower prices from competing suppliers,” he said. “Rather the sellers are in the position of monopolists who can demand whatever price they want because their customers have no alternatives. It’s such exploitation of fellow citizens’ vulnerability that makes price-gouging unfair — and frankly unpatriotic,"" Radcliffe said.

The Justice Department has halted work on Freedom of Information disputes because of the Chinese coronavirus.
Judicial Watch, the government watchdog that routinely files such requests, said it discovered the policy change when the DOJ halted its search for records about top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr and his wife, Nellie Ohr, regarding the anti-Trump dossier created by ex-British spy Christopher Steele.
""Those responsible for Spygate get a breather while the people's right to transparency is put on hold,"" said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. ""When it came to spying on President Trump and innocent Americans, the FBI spared no expense, but coming up with a plan to fulfill their legal obligation to transparency can be put off indefinitely?""

Judicial Watch said the Justice Department claims it is currently unable to continue searching for documents because the employees who would conduct the search in the FBI Records/Information Dissemination Section are ""non-mission critical"" during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The employees were ordered to stay at home beginning March 17.

Michael Seidel, the assistant section chief of the department, said confirmed no FOIA processing has taken place since then. Staff is scheduled to return March 30, but ""the situation remains fluid and will be regularly re-assessed as circumstances change.""
Judicial Watch said the DOJ has failed to respond to a request originally made in 2017 for information about the Ohrs and their communications with Steele.
Judicial Watch previously discovered Ohr was used by the FBI as a conduit regarding the Hillary Clinton-funded dossier between the Justice Department and the opposition-research firm Fusion GPS.
Nellie Ohr, who worked for Fusion GPS, passed dossier information to the FBI through her husband and later deleted emails received from him.
Last year, Judicial Watch found government documents revealing Bruce Ohr knew he had ""possible ethics concerns."" He eventually told Congress he got Clinton-dossier information from his wife, who provided him with a memory stick he then gave to the FBI.

The coronavirus tests will only be given to patients who test negative for influenza, NBC News reported.
Coronavirus symptoms can be similar to flu-like symptoms including fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. However, unless someone has a direct link to Wuhan, China, or a patient infected with the virus, it is more likely that they have the flu.
The flu currently is a much larger threat to American communities, with at least 26 million cases this season. About 14,000 have died from the illness, including 92 children.
""We have the vaccines and the drugs to fight flu illness,"" Messonnier reminded reporters. ""We don't have the tools yet for this novel virus but there are things everyone can do to contain the spread of the illness: stay informed.""

Though only 60 Americans are known to have been infected, and none has yet died, fear has begun to grip the nation as well as the world. Yet, as of now, the numbers don't justify the emotion.
The death toll as of Thursday was 2,800, out of 82,000 cases of coronavirus worldwide. The great majority of these are in China, where the virus originated, though the disease has spread to every continent, with Italy and South Korea the hardest hit outside of China.

Whatever happens medically – the mortality rate of the virus is between 2 and 3% – it's hard to see how the world averts a recession if COVID-19 is not soon contained and controlled. 
Already, Democrats are piling on Trump for cutting funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and failing to reflect the seriousness of the threat. And the issue does present a challenge to Trump's presidency. His handling of it may determine his stature as chief executive. 
Yet the issue is also tailor-made for Trump.
First, the disease comes out of Xi Jinping's China, not Trump's USA. 
Second, the president occupies what Theodore Roosevelt called the ""bully pulpit,"" the White House. He can use that pulpit daily to command the airwaves and inform, lead, unite and direct the nation during what could be a months-long crisis. And Trump alone has the power to declare a national emergency, should that be needed.

If Trump acts as a leader, urging unity in the struggle to contain the virus and discover a vaccine, the hectoring from the Democratic left, already begun, can come to be seen as unpatriotic.
Also, Trump's probable opponent this fall, who would be in charge of preventing the coronavirus from spreading like the Spanish Flu of 1918-19, is Bernie Sanders. And what are Sanders' credentials and plans? 
Under ""Medicare for All,"" Sanders intends to nationalize the entire U.S. heath care system and abolish the private health insurance plans of 140 million Americans who now depend on them. 
As for the pharmaceutical industry, uniquely situated to assist in the crash effort to find a cure for the coronavirus, Sanders will confiscate its profits and put those profiteers out of business.

Chinese factories that produce essential parts for factories and finished products in the U.S., Europe and Asia are shutting down. Supply chains are being severed. Shortages are cropping up.
The Japanese are talking of canceling the Olympics. If the virus spreads here, the question arises: Will our two parties still hold their nominating conventions this summer in Milwaukee and Charlotte?

In recent decades, America's economic and political elites of both parties surrendered America's economic independence for globalism, a new interdependence of nations, where we Americans no longer rely on ourselves alone for the vital necessities of our national life.
That decision is now being exposed as the folly against which Hamilton and economic nationalists always warned. 
According to The Washington Post, critical ingredients of medicines and drugs, upon which many American lives depend, are made in Chinese factories now in danger of being shut down.
In the ongoing struggle between nationalism and globalism, the globalists are taking a beating. Like the Chinese and Japanese and Koreans, Americans are not going to be looking to the WHO or U.N. to ensure their health, but to their own nation-states. And if a pandemic threatens, transnationalism's ""open borders"" ideology is not a policy that will bring universal acclamation.

Despite Ren's disappearance, the Chinese government is finding it hard to keep reports about its mishandling of the initial outbreak of COVID-19 secret.
The New York Times reported last month that the Chinese government had admitted Xi knew about the emerging pandemic for two weeks before he commented on it.
According to the The Times in London, the Chinese government ordered doctors and laboratory technicians to destroy samples of the virus in late December.

On Feb. 4, The Washington Post noted that as the outbreak was in its early stages, the Chinese government summoned doctors and accused them of spreading ""rumors"" when they tried to warn about the disease.
Moreover, the Chinese government denied the virus was being transmitted between humans for much of January, even as doctors knew that was not true, according to The Wall Street Journal.
Meanwhile, some Chinese media outlets and officials have been spreading the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus was created by the United States Army.
A fact-check by USA Today has pushed back on that nonsense, but more needs to be done.

People died as a result of the lack of preparedness caused by what was -- at best -- negligence on the part of the government of the People's Republic of China.

""As I've mentioned before, these are extremely challenging times, and we are seeing a substantial uptick of positive COVID-19 cases throughout New Jersey and throughout the world. The time is now to enact proactive policies that will help save lives in the long run. We've asked families with children to be a part of social distancing by closing our schools. We must all now do our part,"" he said in the statement.
""I completely recognize that these measures will result in substantial changes and inconveniences to our daily lives. However, these measures are being taken to save lives and protect our residents. I strongly urge residents to continue to take every measure possible in order to practice social distancing, washing your hands, and sanitizing all surfaces.""

The Hoboken curfew bans resident of the 53,000-population city from going out between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. until further notice.
The only exceptions are for those going to and from work and for emergencies.
Hoboken, which announced on Friday that it had its first resident test positive for the virus, according to WPIX, is also shutting down dining rooms and bars.
The city is also ordering all bars and restaurants to offer delivery and takeout only to keep the coronavirus from spreading. If a bar does not offer food, it will no longer be permitted to operate or serve alcohol under the new order.
""It’s going to be tough. The high rents and the empty stores that are already here,” said Mike Citarella, owner of the Pig & Parrot liquor store and pub, according to WNBC. “We’ll never survive on just pickup and delivery.”

“We don’t have enough test kits, every day more and more people will be getting sick. We need everyone to understand that they can infect someone or someone can infect you,” he said.
“When I say, 'stay home,' that doesn’t mean go out to lunch with your friends across the street. That means no playdates, that means your nuclear family stays with your nuclear family,"" he said, according to the New York Post.

Much fuss has been made over the past week over China's continued refusals to allow Americans, or any other foreigners, for that matter, to offer assistance with the virus response. It's almost as if they're...hiding something...

Lost sense of smell could be clue to coronavirus infection,"(ECONOMIC TIMES) -- A mother who was infected with the coronavirus couldn’t smell her baby’s full diaper. Cooks who can usually name every spice in a restaurant dish can’t smell curry or garlic, and food tastes bland. Others say they can’t pick up the sweet scent of shampoo or the foul odor of kitty litter.
Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell, and ageusia, an accompanying diminished sense of taste, have emerged as peculiar telltale signs of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and possible markers of infection.

On Friday, British ear, nose and throat doctors, citing reports from colleagues around the world, called on adults who lose their senses of smell to isolate themselves for seven days, even if they have no other symptoms, to slow the disease’s spread.

Astronomer believes coronavirus came from ... outer space!,"(Image courtesy Pixabay)
The coronavirus is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China, and some speculate it came from a bioweapons lab there.
Advertisement - story continues below
Now, a British professor says that while Wuhan may be the earthly origin, the virus likely came from outer space.
The Express newspaper of London reported mathematician, astronomer and astrobiologist Chandra Wickramasinghe of the Buckingham Centre for Astrobiology recently noted a remarkable fact.
It was in northeastern China where a fragment of a comet exploded in a brief flash last October, spewing out ""hundreds of trillions"" of particles.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

""We think it probable that this contained embedded within it a monoculture of infective 2019-nCoV virus particles that survived in the interior of the incandescent meteor."" Wickramasinghe told the London Express newspaper. ""We consider the seemingly outrageous possibility that hundreds of trillions of infective viral particles were then released embedded in the form of fine carbonaceous dust. We believe infectious agents are prevalent in space, carried on comets, and can fall towards Earth through the troposphere.""
Wickramasinghe worked for 40 years with famed English astronomer Fred Hoyle to develop the hypothesis of panspermia -- that life exists throughout the universe and is distributed by space dust and meteoroids.
Advertisement - story continues below
The professor told the Express, ""These, we think, can and have in the past gone on to bring about human disease epidemics.""
The two believe the 1918 flu pandemic and certain outbreaks of polio and mad cow disease were triggered that way.
""We believe this could have happened with the novel coronavirus. While it is likely it arrived as a new infective agent, there could be an element of mutation triggered by DNA arriving in a similar manner,"" Wickramasingh said. ""We have evidence that even in the human genome, 40% of our DNA is viral, and it has been incorporated during our evolution. There is growing evidence that says this DNA comes from space and it is carried into our atmosphere on micro-meteorites before dissipating. It is then taken up by bacteria and viruses. That new insert could have come from space. This disturbing outbreak is due to this, there is no doubt meteorites carry living structures.
The professor said the ""pattern of further global spread of the new coronavirus is likely to follow a high level of person-to-person infectivity, the virus will then acquire endemic status.""

But Fox News host Tucker Carlson points out Chinese officials previously acknowledged the origin of the virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan, possibly from a science lab.
Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, charged Wednesday it was ""extremely irresponsible"" for media to say the virus originated in China, saying his government ""is still tracing the origin of the virus and there is no conclusion yet.""
Thursday he doubled down, with the claim it came from the the U.S. Army.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Carlson reminded viewers it was China that first claimed the virus originated at an animal lab in Wuhan:
""As the death toll rises, it's important never to forget how we got here. This pandemic came out of China and it came out of China for a reason. It's a country with poor health practices. It's a country where government officials deliberately covered up the early stages of the virus when it could have been stopped before it spread out of control. In fact the outbreak may have begun not in a public meat market, but in a poorly run Chinese laboratory. That's not our theory. Anyone who raises that theory on American television is attacked as a conspiracy monger. But this is a theory from a now-censored Chinese paper. In a draft paper posted in mid-February, scientists at the South China University of Technology suggested the virus outbreak, coronavirus outbreak, began at the Wuhan Center for Disease Control, where an animal may have infected a researcher, who then spread the virus outside the facility.""

He quoted from the paper, ""The killer coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.""
See his comments:

Carlson said, ""We have no idea if that's actually true, but again those were Chinese researchers, making an evidence-based argument about the origin of this virus.
""That paper's since been taken down, no explanation has been offered for that but you can guess,"" he said.

He said that instead, China now is blaming the U.S. and making threats about withholding components used for medicines.
He said the American media also is to blame for claiming ""xenophobia"" for calling it the Wuhan or Chinese coronavirus.

Drinking, selling or buying alcohol has been outlawed in Iran since the establishment of the Islamic Republic government in 1979, Fox News reported.
However, people have reportedly been drinking bootlegged alcohol made from methanol as a remedy for coronavirus.

This remedy rumor came from forwarded messages on social media accounts falsely suggesting people had been cured of the coronavirus with whiskey and honey, citing a tabloid story about a British school teacher who had done so, according to the AP.
This story combined with messages about the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers to kill the virus led many to believe drinking high-proof alcohol would do the same inside their bodies.
The rumors led people to start drinking bootlegged alcohol containing methanol, which has no scent or taste in drinks.
Methanol can cause delayed organ and brain damage, chest pain, nausea, hyperventilation, blindness and coma, according to the AP.
Hassanian told the news outlet that in some provinces, the number of people poisoned by the bootlegged alcohol has exceeded the number of people with COVID-19.

""If we'd had those [two months] and been able to sequence the virus, and had the cooperation necessary from the Chinese, had a WHO team been on the ground, had a CDC team, which we'd offered, been on the ground, I think we could have dramatically curtailed what happened both in China and what's now happening across the world,"" O'Brien said.

1st coronavirus-related drug shortage hits U.S.,"(FORTUNE) The first drug shortages directly tied to the coronavirus outbreak have hit the U.S, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The agency did not identify the specific drug that was impacted but said in an announcement Thursday the shortage was due to a key ingredient sourced from China being unavailable.

“A manufacturer has alerted us to a shortage of a human drug that was recently added to the drug shortages list,” the FDA said. “The manufacturer just notified us that this shortage is related to a site affected by coronavirus. The shortage is due to an issue with manufacturing of an active pharmaceutical ingredient used in the drug.”

"Coronavirus is being weaponized by Soros, others behind anti-Trump ads","President Donald J. Trump talks to members of the press on the South Lawn of the White House Friday, Feb. 7, 2020, prior to boarding Marine One to begin his trip to Charlotte, N.C. (Official White House photo by Joyce N. Boghosian)
The Chinese coronavirus is being weaponized by opponents of President Trump who will spend millions of dollars to oppose the president in several Midwest states.

The Free Beacon reports the Democratic Party's leading super PAC, Priorities USA Action, plans to spend $6 million this week on political ads criticizing the president over the Chinese coronavirus.
A key money man behind the move is liberal billionaire George Soros.
CNN first reported Monday on Priorities USA's new ads.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

The report cites Federal Election Commission paperwork showing Soros' Democracy PAC gave $3 million for the cause, which was 77% of the $3.9 million the PAC reported receiving last month.
Overall, Priorities USA plans to spend in the range of $150 million in the key battleground states of Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in those states in 2016, which she was expected to carry.
The Free Beacon reported: ""Priorities is not the only group using the coronavirus pandemic to attack Trump. PACRONYM, a super PAC tied to the nonprofit ACRONYM, which was in charge of the botched Iowa app that caused chaos during the Iowa caucuses, is launching a similar campaign.""
PACRONYM said recently it will spend $5 million on digital advertising against the president, taking advantage of the pandemic.
The report said David Brock's American Bridge PAC also has been weaponizing the coronavirus against the president.
Spokesman Bradley Beychok told the Free Beacon: ""Our job is to hold Donald Trump accountable, and we have no plans to let up, particularly with a focus on economic issues as we've done to date. ... We're not going to give him a pass for bungling the government's response to this pandemic.""

It's far from the only organized attack on the president. The Washington Examiner reported Tuesday that conservative radio host Mark Levin has accused Democrats in Congress of trying to ""tank"" the American economy to hurt the president.
""And the Democrats will know this will come to an end, and they don't give a damn if the economy sinks,"" Levin said. ""You wanna know why? Think about it. Cause they consider themselves winning no matter what. Trump will be defeated in their minds. They'll be able to nationalize industries. They'll be able to take over corporate board rooms. ... They'll be able to do everything.""
He said America is facing a problem right now, and that means ""Democrats believe there is opportunity. This Democrat Party is a diabolical, evil party.""
The president wants businesses to be up and running and workers back at their jobs by Easter, April 12.

He is blamed for gas prices, the stock market (only when it is doing badly; otherwise it is Obama’s market) and now coronavirus, as an Op-Ed in the New York Times showed.
Writer Gail Collins ridiculed the president’s appointment of Vice President Mike Pence as the ""Coronavirus Czar"" and went on to mock several more members of the administration in her piece.
“Yeah, when you think of Mike Pence you maybe don’t think about Pandemic Fighter Supreme. But as President Trump pointed out repeatedly, he has already run Indiana,” Collins wrote.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

“Well, it probably could have been worse. Having a czar does make you feel there’s somebody in charge. At least Trump didn’t come before the cameras and announce solemnly, ‘Today I’m asking every American to cross your fingers.’”
She went on to criticize the president for saying that the stock market skid could be due to investors' fears that one of the lunatics in the Democratic presidential primary could become president.
Advertisement - story continues below
This is likely not the reason for the skid and she is correct: It is likely the coronavirus fears that the media keeps pushing.
As Rush Limbaugh has said, the media sees this virus as an opportunity to use it as a weapon against Trump in the 2020 presidential election.
Because the media, of which Collins is a part, realize that the American people tend to blame the American president for everything, even things that happen outside of our borders.
This is not something that has happened exclusively to Trump, but the media would be fighting the claims of presidential responsibility for something like this if the president were a Democrat.
“So the problems are the Democrats and the flu. The answers are Mike Pence and … reminding the public once again that Nancy Pelosi’s district has a big homeless problem,” she said.
Advertisement - story continues below
Well, viruses and disease do tend to affect the homeless population more than others so, yeah, it should be a concern.
The fact is there is no decision the president could have made that would have met with the approval of Collins and her media cohorts.
They see the train wreck on the Democratic side, and they can see their chances of taking back the White House and the Senate and keeping the House are dwindling.
It is likely that their nominee is going to be socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont (unless they find a way to rob it from him again, in which case many of his supporters won’t vote).

Presidents often face threats against their well-being or lives.

But mostly they come from people who are off-balance mentally, and federal officials routinely deal with them, often without the president's knowledge.
However, the latest against President Trump took some forethought, with the creation of a Political Action Committee that offers ""10 Stacks to the person who infects Donald douchebag Trump with Coronavirus/Covid-19.""
Dave Levinthal of the Center for Public Integrity noted that's a ""good way to get an unannounced visit"" from federal law enforcement, reported Colin Kalmbacher at the Law and Crime blog.

Ivy said it is the first time the private school, most of whose students board there, has closed early, according to the Rockland/Westchester Journal News.

In a statement posted on the school's website calling the closure, ""An Occasion to Teach and Learn Online,"" the school said it was acting ""to protect students’ safety and health at the first priority.""
""The prudent course of action for the safety of our students and the effective management of the situation is to anticipate an increase of cases in the School to reach a large number during the coming months and render the School an infection cluster,"" the statement said, adding that classes will now be held online.

A team of international researchers have concluded that the novel coronavirus has entirely natural origins through evolution.
Public genome sequence data on Covid-19, as well as similar viruses, was extensively analyzed for this study. The results show absolutely no indication that the virus was produced artificially or in a lab setting.

“But consider what is driving it. When faced with risks, the best way to manage overreaction is expert leadership providing honest information. The absence of that logically sparks overreaction. So what exactly is dumb?” she added.
Musk explained why he called the panic dumb in a later tweet.
“Virality of C19 is overstated due to conflating diagnosis date with contraction date & over-extrapolating exponential growth, which is never what happens in reality,” he said in a tweet Sunday, noting that people mistakenly believe the rate of spread will continue exponentially.
Musk added: “Fatality rate also greatly overstated. Because there are so few test kits, those who die with respiratory symptoms are tested for C19, but those with minor symptoms are usually not. Prevalence of coronaviruses & other colds in general population is very high!”
U.S. officials are taking the matter seriously, telling people to prepare for the worst if the virus spreads.

California, for one, is monitoring at least 8,400 people who might have come into contact with the virus, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said during a news conference Thursday.

The former “Who’s The Boss” and “Charmed” star said she had tears in her eyes watching former Vice President Joe Biden speak Thursday, presumably about the coronavirus pandemic.

“Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,” Biden said in his speech.
“Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president fueled by an adversarial relationship with the truth that [President Trump] continues to have.”

So, Milano, his leadership of what? Biden is in charge of absolutely nothing, including his own family if you believe he didn't know about his son’s Ukraine dealings.
It's also questionable that Biden is even in charge of his own mental faculties at this point.
All he did on Thursday was attack the president. How did he in any way help the nation during this time of crisis?
He didn't.
Of course, in Milano’s warped mind, attacking President Trump is really all you need to do for her to get teary-eyed and gain her trust.

Milano is the same mental giant who attended a fundraiser for former Democratic presidential candidate, and world-class moonbat, Marianne Williamson.
“I’m going to my first fundraiser of the election cycle and it’s [email protected],” Milano tweeted in July.
“I know. I know. But she’s the only candidate talking about the collective, soulful ache of the nation & I think that’s an important discussion to have,” she said.

Democratic socialist Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders had previously sought the endorsement of Milano, for some reason believing that endorsement would have value.
She was also an advisor to Biden as she shifted his support for the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal funding of abortion clinics, Fox News reported.
This is the brain trust that the Democrats have on their team as they head into the 2020 presidential election.

Experts are now using the word pandemic to describe the virus.
“It’s very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said, according to The New York Times.
Advertisement - story continues below
“But will it be catastrophic? I don’t know,"" he said.
It is “increasingly unlikely that the virus can be contained,” Dr. Thomas R. Frieden,  former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.
“It is therefore likely that it will spread, as flu and other organisms do, but we still don’t know how far, wide or deadly it will be,"" he said.
""This looks far more like H1N1’s spread than SARS, and I am increasingly alarmed,” Dr. Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said. “Even 1 percent mortality would mean 10,000 deaths in each million people.”
The head of the World Health Organization, however, cautioned against panic.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus said “panic and fear” were the real challenges facing society.
“So the 146 [cases] means that it is very small; there is nothing to be scared of,” he said, according to The Washington Post. “If we are going to take this in the right perspective, it should be used as a signal to prepare.”
China on Monday accused the U.S. of overreacting to the virus.
“The U.S. government hasn’t provided any substantial assistance to us,” Hua Chunying, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, said in a briefing carried out through China's WeChat app instead of in person due to the virus.

“But it was the first to evacuate personnel from its consulate in Wuhan, the first to suggest partial withdrawal of its embassy staff, and the first to impose a travel ban on Chinese travelers. All it has done could only create and spread fear, which is a bad example,” she said.
“The U.S. is turning from overconfidence to fear and overreaction,” she said.
Last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the U.S. first reached out to China on Jan. 6 with an offer of assistance that was never acted upon until China asked for WHO intervention last week.

'Comedian' Patton Oswalt fantasizes about Trump fans dying of coronavirus infection,"Take a sketchy, unsubstantiated news story.
Add an over-inflated headline.
Advertisement - story continues below
Top it off with a C-list celebrity with a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome and access to social media.
And you just might end up with a Twitter post like the one published by actor-comedian Patton Oswalt on Monday, gleefully fantasizing about supporters of President Donald Trump dying painfully of a coronavirus infection while complaining about the mainstream media.
MAGAt dying from COVID-19: “Why did the *cough* media treat Trump so *cough cough* unfairly...” https://t.co/kWdATsCY3K
— Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) March 10, 2020

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment


Oswalt is probably best known for playing the lovable loser Spence Olchin on ""King of Queens"" in the late '90s and early to mid-2000s. (Fans of the show probably would never have guessed what a mean-spirited louse was under that perennially put-upon exterior.)
Advertisement - story continues below
These days, he apparently follows a flaming liberal news site called PoliticusUSA and was responding to a report there headlined “Trump Demands Barr Investigate The Media’s Coronavirus Coverage.”
The article was based on a single quote, from an anonymous source, in a Vanity Fair story published Monday purporting to show Trump’s reaction to the ongoing coronavirus crisis.
""'He wants Justice to open investigations of the media for market manipulation,' a source close to the White House told me,” special correspondent Gabriel Sherman wrote.
Even assuming that sentence is true, and even assuming the “source” Sherman spoke to had some special knowledge of Trump’s thinking that isn’t available to the voluble president’s millions of Twitter followers, that quote is a long, long way from the PoliticusUSA headline that portrayed the president as personally demanding Attorney General William Barr launch some sort of investigation in the mainstream media.
In other words, this is the epitome of what’s become known these days as “fake news.”
Advertisement - story continues below
But that, of course, just meant dedicated liberals like Oswalt were even more intent to pass it on, along with his own mental image of a Trump supporter about to expire from a coronavirus infection.
And it didn’t stop Patton’s benighted followers from joining in:
If Trump was the Jaws mayor, he'd keep the beaches open even after the last big attack and 40% of Amity would not only keep swimming but would yell FAKE NEWS as the shark ate them.

He asked the AG to investigate the press? That’s not despotic at all. Totally normal. 😐
— Nick (@NicksOpinions) March 10, 2020

Again, that’s not at all what Sherman’s sketchy report suggested. It’s how a liberal website chose to wildly inflate what’s an otherwise largely substance-free report from Vanity Fair about how the coronavirus is allegedly affecting the White House.
But the worst thing about Oswalt’s tweet is not simply that it passes along what is almost certainly a lie -- that Trump demanded Barr investigate the media for coronavirus coverage.
Advertisement - story continues below
What’s worse is that it pretended that there was no reason for Trump and his supporters to assume that the mainstream media is against him.
What's worse yet that it pretends there’s no reason to suspect the mainstream media and the Democrats it supports are, in fact, cheering on the damage the outbreak is causing as a means of hurting the man in the White House.
The sad facts of the matter are:
That Trump’s opponents are shamelessly using the coronavirus as a political weapon;

That liberals in the media doing their best to support the effort (a late February column in The New York Times was headlined “Let’s Call It ‘Trumpvirus’”);
And that the current volatility on Wall Street stemming from the coronavirus outbreak (Monday's shattering losses followed by Tuesday's recovery, for instance) is one of the rare pieces of economic news liberals will be able to use against a president who has otherwise overseen an astounding three-year run of low unemployment and rising wages.
Advertisement - story continues below
Another reality is that even Democratic governors who otherwise despise the Trump administration have acknowledged that the president has performed admirably in the face of the crisis.
But the success of the United States is not the standard for liberals, defeating Trump is.
And if that means taking the inflated lies of a digital liberal rag and amplifying them on social media to hordes of followers, then they forge ahead “by any means necessary.”
For liberals like Patton, the coronavirus is a weapon to be used against the politicians and people they perceive as their enemies.

They shouldn’t be surprised when that perception goes both ways.

But when Twitter users got there, they found that instead of learning how Biden was going to help them, they were the ones asked to help Biden in terms of a donation to the campaign.

Savvy users could spot the message in the upper right corner of the screen and click past the sales pitch to find out what Biden would do if elected in November. However, those who want to read the plan will be reminded that the campaign needs money, courtesy of a banner across the top of the screen.
""Biden believes we must spend whatever it takes, without delay, to meet public health needs and deal with the mounting economic consequences. The federal government must act swiftly and aggressively to help protect and support our families, small businesses, first responders and caregivers essential to help us face this challenge, those who are most vulnerable to health and economic impacts, and our broader communities – not to blame others or bail out corporations,"" the plan states.
The plan supposes that the federal response to the 2014 Ebola panic and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was enough to support being tried again. President Donald Trump has already poked a hole in that argument.
Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!

Biden also insists he can do a better job of communicating than Trump, following the liberal line of attacking Trump's work to communicate with the American people.
""Biden believes we must immediately put scientists and public health leaders front and center in communication with the American people in order to provide regular guidance and deliver timely public health updates, including by immediately establishing daily, expert-led press briefings,"" the plan said.

Biden also casts doubt upon the ability of the Centers for Disease Control to decide who gets tested, arguing that ""The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) must draw on advice from outside scientists to clarify the criteria for testing.""

Biden also calls for a long-term plan that reverses what he allowed to happen under the Obama adminisration.
""The U.S. government should immediately work with the private sector to map critical health care supplies; identify their points of origin; examine the supply chain process; and create a strategic plan to build redundancies and domestic capacity. The goal is to develop the next generation of biomedical research and manufacturing excellence, bring back U.S. manufacturing of medical products we depend on, and ensure we are not vulnerable to supply chain disruptions, whether from another pandemic, or because of political or trade disputes,"" Biden's plan states.
However, while he was vice president under former President Barack Obama, Biden watched as China established dominance over the pharmaceutical sector Americans rely upon.

""You've got to be realistic,"" he told CNN on Wednesday.
""And you've got to understand that you don't make the timeline, the virus makes the timeline. So you've got to respond, in what you see happen. And if you keep seeing this acceleration, it doesn't matter what you say. One week, two weeks, three weeks -- you've got to go with what the situation on the ground is.""
Fauci also cautioned that in looking at restoring America to pre-virus footing, there may be a new normal in store.
""We really need to be prepared for another cycle,"" Fauci told reporters at a news briefing.

President Donald Trump said Wednesday at the news conference that lifting restrictions is likely to happen on a piecemeal basis, according to a White House media pool report.
""America continues to gain ground in the war against the virus,"" Trump said. ""I want to thank the American people for answering the call, following our guidelines and making the sacrifices required to overcome this terrible threat.
""More aggressively we commit to social distancing -- so important. Social distancing -- such an important phrase. And we do it right now. The more lives we can save and the sooner we can eventually get people back to work, back to school and back to normal.""
""And there are large sections of our country -- probably can go back much sooner than other sections. And we're obviously looking at that also. People are asking, 'Is that an alternative?' And I say, 'Absolutely, it is an alternative,'"" Trump said.

Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said numbers should not become a source of fear.
""I know that it has become a place where people are looking at numbers rather than what is needed,"" she said. ""Because if you do these projections, when you got to those projections that said -- like in Germany and others, that implied that 60 percent or 50 percent of the population would get infected -- the -- I want to be very clear, the only way that happens is if this virus remains continuously moving through populations in this cycle, in the fall cycle, and another cycle.
""So that's through three cycles with nothing being done,"" she added.
""And so we're dealing with Cycle A right now, not the one that could come in the fall of 2020 -- although we're getting prepared for it by the innovations that are being worked on -- and not the 2021,"" Birx said.

Talk radio rises to coronavirus challenge,"(TALKERS) -- This past weekend seems to have marked a tipping point in America regarding public anxiety over COVID-19, still commonly referred to as the coronavirus.  Fears and near-panic have infiltrated the beleaguered heath care systems of our communities, the stock market, and a number of inter-connected industries and public events.  Add to that, discourse about the problem in our politically oriented media have included the “weaponization” of issues per the troubling practice of each side tending to seek victory at the expense of truth.
We must rise to the challenge

One of the biggest challenges facing the talk media industry is to demonstrate a thoughtfulness in responsibly walking the line between spreading undo alarm versus under-reporting the seriousness of this still-murky threat.
That being said, hoping not to appear opportunistic or exploitive, most radio industry practitioners agree that this crisis provides radio both the mission and calling to provide a significant degree of comfort and helpful information to the public – thus showcasing its pertinence as a vital medium in the 21st century.

Mystery deepens over animal source of coronavirus,"(NATURE) Scientists are racing to identify the source of the coronavirus that is causing havoc around the world. Three weeks ago, Chinese scientists suggested, on the basis of genetic analyses, that the scaly, ant-eating pangolin was the prime suspect. But scientists have now examined those data — along with three other pangolin coronavirus genome studies released last week — and say that although the animal is still a contender, the mystery is far from solved.

Public-health officials want to pin down the virus’s source so they can prevent new outbreaks. Scientists assume that the pathogen jumped to people from an animal, as has been seen with other coronaviruses; for example, the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is thought to have jumped to humans from civets in 2002. Dozens of people infected early in the current outbreak worked in a live-animal market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, but tests of coronavirus samples found at the market have yet to identify a source.

"Coronavirus shows insanity of Green movement as reusable cups replaced with cleaner, disposable cups","In an effort to help stop the spread of coronavirus, Starbucks has announced it will no longer serve drinks in customer-provided reusable cups.
The temporary measure was announced Wednesday and immediately went into effect in all of the eco-friendly mega corporation’s U.S. and Canada locations.
Advertisement - story continues below
In response, some customers are upset.
The Seattle, Washington-based corporation’s normal policy -- in which customers who being in their own reusable cup get a 10-cent discount -- is apparently very popular with its customer base.
Prior to last Wednesday, customers could also order their drink in a ""for here"" ceramic mug that they return once they are finished.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

That policy has been put on hold for the time being, Rossann Williams, the head of retail operations for Starbucks' U.S. and Canada-based stores, announced in a blog post on the company's website.
“As a global company, we’ve been closely monitoring the dynamic situation of COVID-19, along with the rest of the world,” Williams wrote.
Advertisement - story continues below
“As North America began experiencing heightened concerns, we quickly initiated a regular cadence of communications with our store partners to ensure they have the support they need. We’ve already taken a series of precautionary steps in response to this emerging public health impact,” she added.
Williams then dropped the hammer on the coffee chain’s woke, eco-conscious reusable cup crowd. According to Williams, all iced caramel macchiato lattes with almond milk and 27 Splendas will have to be poured into store-provided, disposable cups.
“We are pausing the use of personal cups and 'for here' ware in our stores. We will continue to honor the 10-cent discount for anyone who brings in a personal cup or asks for ‘for here’ ware,” she wrote.
With Williams' words, the liberal pipe dream of sustainability was thrown out the window, and some people were no longer able to save the world. Don't tell Greta Thunberg.
Welcome to reality, Starbucks.
Advertisement - story continues below
The chain's top brass apparently recognizes that customer-provided cups could potentially aid the spread of coronavirus, and thus eliminated a risk before it became a problem.
While Starbucks will still honor its 10-cent discount, all customers will have to drink their expensive coffee in single-use cups that they will have to throw away when they are finished.
The policy change immediately ruffled feathers among the Starbucks eco crowd:
Just as a heads up, Starbucks on campus are now not accepting reusable cups due to coronavirus concerns. This isn’t something we have control over, please don’t yell at us for not being able to save your 10¢. This came directly from corporate and is nonnegotiable.

Other customers also took to social media to share their disappointment with the policy:

If being prevented from bringing your reusable cup to a Starbucks location throws your life into a crisis, then perhaps it’s time to count your blessings or reevaluate your priorities.

Of course, some of the most radical environmentalists often claim that people are the greatest threat to the planet.
Perhaps in their minds, treating reusable cups as contraband is a missed opportunity for them to see a large number of people killed or sickened.

"As coronavirus cases jump to 60K overnight, Marines release 'pandemic' plan","A major shift in the reported trajectory of the COVID-19 novel coronavirus has rocked China and comes as the U.S. military begins preparations for a pandemic-type scenario on American soil.
A jump in confirmed cases came Thursday morning as Chinese officials gave an updated count of over 59,900 infected on the mainland. Coupled with international cases, the infected now number over 60,000.
Advertisement - story continues below
The increase of 14,840 new cases is the result of the central government's changing criteria used to make a confirmed diagnosis, The New York Times' Sui-Lee Wee reported.
This means that the virus now has a much different trajectory than previously thought thanks to more accurate numbers, and hints that not even the Chinese government knows the scale of this outbreak.
While China was blindsided by the contagion, which can spread before symptoms even appear, other countries were able to exploit the small amount of warning they were given.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Many countries surrounding China have shuttered their borders, and entire airlines have canceled flights to the impacted region.
Several cases have been confirmed on American soil, but civil authorities and President Donald Trump have acted to make sure the virus stays contained.

Due to the continuing threat of a potential outbreak, the U.S. military is similarly preparing to fight COVID-19 head-on.
""The current threat of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus has raised concern that this virus could result in a pandemic disease,"" a Marine administrative message from Wednesday reads. ""In such a scenario, nCoV could spread, infecting U.S. personnel, and threaten the operational readiness of the U.S. Marine Corps.""
The Marines' plan focuses on several aspects, all chosen to maintain operational integrity for the force and secure the safety of the American people.
To ensure a healthy fighting force, the message describes an intervention and quarantine plan for personnel that may have been exposed to the virus, as well as plans to contain the virus should outbreaks occur.
The Marines' message also lays out support for civilian authorities and the U.S. government during any future efforts to combat a pandemic.

While the United States and its armed forces stand ready to face the disease, China's communist regime is struggling to keep a lid on the pandemic in the mainland.
Social media postings critical of the ruling communist party and its response to the COVID-19 outbreak have been quickly suppressed, a classic tactic used by the country's leaders.
The quarantine isn't only digital, but physical as well.
Tens of millions have been corralled and kept in cities in a bid to contain the virus, which hasn't been very effective. The coronavirus can now be found all across China.

Misinformation means that bad advice can circulate very quickly – and it can change human behavior to take greater risks.”

CDC official helping spook Trump's economy with coronavirus fears is Rod Rosenstein's sister,"An intriguing connection related to one of America's top health officials at the center of the national discussion over the potential severity of the coronavirus in America has some wondering about a conspiracy, while others find only a coincidence.
Fears that the coronavirus will have devastating impacts beyond those already being registered around the globe have triggered a major Wall Street selloff. President Donald Trump has pushed back against the culture of panic.

But is there a political tinge to the pronouncements? Speculation that there could be rose after it was discovered that the health official making dire pronouncements about the impact of the coronavirus contrary to those offered by Trump is connected to another high-profile individual who was often at odds with the president -- former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.
Rosenstein, who played a role in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, had a checkered relationship with Trump. In 2018, The New York Times linked Rosenstein to an internal administration plot to record Trump in secret and then invoke the 25th Amendment, under which a president can be removed for being unfit to perform his duties. Although Rosenstein denied the claim, the accusation cast a shadow over his final months as deputy attorney general.
During a hearing to be confirmed to that post, Rosenstein submitted written testimony saying that his sister was ""Dr. Nancy Messonnier and that ""she is the Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""

This week, while the president was trying to reassure Americans that health officials were working to protect Americans, Messonnier was taking a different approach.
“It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but more really a question of when it will happen,” she said, according to NPR, adding that a ""significant disruption"" to Americans' daily lives is possible.

""We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare with the expectation that this could be bad.""
The combination of her recent comments and her family connection has led some commentators to voice a concern that Messonnier might be pushing the panic button harder than necessary for motives that had nothing to do with health.
""Rod Rosenstein as we all know definitely worked to undermine the Trump administration, which is oddly exactly what his sister is doing by undermining the more logical and calm message the president’s team has issued on the virus,"" an article on commentator Wayne Dupree's website read.
The article contrasted the more dire comments voiced by Messonnier and Republican Sen. Mitt Romey of Utah with others from Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.
""It’s interesting to see the contrast in statements from those that are clearly aligned with the president to those who are not,"" the article went on. ""Looks like this is yet another instance of D.C. swamp creatures using any opportunity to undermine President Trump.""

Talk show host Rush Limbaugh has said that overhyped predictions about the virus are driven by politics and not medicine.
""It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump,"" he said on a recent broadcast.
Others have defended Messonnier.
""I've heard people jumping on Nancy Messonnier because she told us the truth: that it's not a matter of if but when,"" Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said, according to Politico. ""Isn't that what you want to hear instead of some pie in the sky?""

Some took the approach that if conservative commentators were citing the connection, there must be nothing to it.
Rush Limbaugh and right-wing fringe sites are attacking Dr. Nancy Messonnier, a top CDC official handling the coronavirus response, because she is Rod Rosenstein's sister. They're spreading the lie that she's part of the deep state and trying to tank the markets to weaken Trump.

Limbaugh, however, stuck to his guns and said that political motives should never be dismissed.

White House officials considering plans to make China pay for the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic that has infected thousands and killed hundreds in America.
The Daily Caller reported officials at the White House said on condition of anonymity that senior officials have been briefed on the idea of holding the Chinese Communist Party accountable.
""The White House confirmed to the Daily Caller they are aware of the effort but declined to comment when asked about potential executive action on the issue. Several of President Donald Trump’s top out-of-government advisers are also aware of the effort,"" the report said.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

One adviser said such punishment ""can unite our country against a common enemy,"" and another expressed personal support, the report said.
Meanwhile, the Berman Law Group in partnership with the Lucas/Compton lobbying and public affairs firm has filed suit,  citing misinformation that has been spread by the Chinese government over the beginning of the virus, apparently in Wuhan, China.
Advertisement - story continues below
It accuses the government of ""acting from their own economic self-interest and looking to protect their place as a super-power."" In that regard, the Communist Party in China ""failed to report the outbreak as quickly as they could have,"" the complaint says.
The Daily Caller said all members of Congress will be sent a detailed brief about this suit.
The Daily Caller said the Berman Law Group ""is advised by Francis Biden, brother to former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, while Lucas/Compton employs George Sorial, a longtime Trump ally. The team leading the suit believes it's important to petition both political parties across the whole of government to champion the cause if it has any real chance of making China pay for coronavirus fallout.""
Members of Congress already have called for an investigation into allegations that China covered up the coronavirus until it was raging out of control.
Another lawsuit has been launched in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas by Larry Klayman, the founder of Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch.

The complaint demands $20 trillion in damages.
The class-action filing seeks damages for the spread of the virus from the city of Wuhan around the world, forcing unprecedented restrictions on public life that could trigger economic recession or even depression.
Klayman's complaint was filed against China, the People's Liberation Army, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and several individuals.
Klayman said the lawsuit is not for political reasons but to aid the victims.

The objective, he said, is to ""have a jury award damages to the victims of China's release of the COVID-19 virus, which has already killed many Americans, exposed huge numbers of others to death and harm, caused extreme emotional distress to loved ones and friends, and is on the verge of causing a near total stock market and economic collapse.""
""There is no reason why the American taxpayer should, contrary to the [will of the] establishment in Washington, D.C., have to pay for the tremendous harm caused by the Chinese government. The Chinese people are a good people, but their government is not and it must be made to pay dearly. The huge relief package now likely to pass in Congress will further bankrupt the nation and We the People must ourselves take legal matters into our own hands,"" he said.
""The Chinese government and its officials are not immune from suit, as biological weapons are not just outlawed by international conventions, but are in effect a terrorist weapon, that are developed to destroy civilian populations,"" he said.
He urged Americans who want to join the class-action suit to sign up at Freedom Watch's website

That complaint states: ""This is a complaint for damages and equitable relief arising out of the creation and release, accidental or otherwise, of a variation of coronavirus known as COVID-19 by the People's Republic of China and its agencies and officials as a biological weapon in violation of China's agreements under international treaties, and recklessly or otherwise allowing its release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology into the city of Wuhan, China, in Hubei Province, by among other acts failing to prevent the institute's personnel from becoming infected with the bioweapon and carrying it into the surrounding community and proliferation into the United States.""

It found only 30% say the government is doing a poor job.

The Ebola outbreak took place during the Barack Obama administration.
""But a closer look at the latest findings shows that while 70% of Republicans give the government positive marks for its response to date, just 31% of Democrats and 35% of voters not affiliated with either major party agree.""
Two of three Democrats and half of unaffiliated voters believe the coronavirus is a major health threat, but three of five Republicans believe ""that the media and some politicians are playing up the threat of coronavirus to hurt President Trump.""
Overall, one in three voters believes the media are ""playing it up"" to hurt the president they oppose.
""Forty-nine percent (49%) of voters agree with the Federal Reserve Board’s decision to cut interest rates in response to the potential economic threat of the coronavirus. Only 24% disagree with the Fed’s action, but slightly more (27%) are undecided about it,"" the report said.

The Senate action came despite reservations about several items in the package. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said passage was necessary.
“This is not even a stimulus package. It is emergency relief. Emergency relief. That’s what this is,” the Kentucky Republican said Wednesday.

The bill would give every individual adult making under $75,000 per year a one-time payment of $1,200. For married couples making less than $150,000, the payment would be $2,400 plus $500 per child.
The Senate bill bases income on either 2018 or 2019 tax returns, with those who did not file taxes able to use either Form SSA-1099, the Social Security Benefit Statement or Form RRB-1099, the Social Security Equivalent Benefit Statement.
Although the bill carries a $2 billion price tag, the Senate lopped off several initial House demands, including Democratic proposals to alter the operations of elections, require federal agencies to review how they use ""minority banks"" and curb airlines' carbon emissions, Fox News reported.

Those provisions had stirred the wrath of many Americans in need of financial relief.

""She exploited the opportunity of a deadly pandemic to inject the virus of identity politics into corporate America when it was on its knees,"" she wrote, citing a passage that was too much for the Senate to swallow in which the House bill said that, ""Any corporation that receives federal aid related to COVID–19 must maintain officials and budget dedicated to diversity and inclusion initiatives for no less than five years after disbursement of funds.”
""Of course, after five years the company would be wholly woke,"" Devine wrote. ""How much of our society’s energies have been squandered on such woke triviality in recent decades, and how effete has it rendered us in the face of adversity?

Illegal U.S. border crossings down by half under coronavirus shutdown,"U.S. border with Mexico stretches more than 1,950 miles, much of it unpatrolled.
[Editor's note: This story originally was published by the Daily Caller News Foundation.]

By Jason Hopkins
Daily Caller News Foundation
Since the Trump administration ordered a shutdown of the U.S.-Mexico border, government officials are reporting a roughly 50% drop in illegal alien apprehensions.
Under orders from the Centers for Disease Control, the Trump administration on Friday declared a lockdown of the southern and northern borders, permitting only the flow of “essential” travel. In that short time, border officials have revealed that they are seeing a huge drop in the flow of illegal aliens.

“Since [Customs and Border Protection] began implementing [the CDC] order, we’ve seen a major decline in traffic at our borders — 54% decrease at ports and 52% decline in USBP encounters — while trade remains level,” CBP acting commissioner Mark Morgan tweeted Sunday. “These reductions reflect a historic & aggressive containment strategy by [President Donald Trump] to protect the US.”
Morgan was not the only one to report a steep decline in the flow of traffic at the U.S.-Mexico border.

“Without that documentation, we see individuals coming into the country without proper identity documents, without travel documents, without medical history. So it’s very hard to make a public health determination on those individuals,” Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said Sunday during an appearance on Fox Business.
Wolf was speaking about DHS actions in the wake of the coronavirus epidemic. Allowing individuals to enter the U.S. with unknown medical histories risks exacerbating the spread of the disease, and so the CDC ordered a shutdown of all non-essential flow between the border.
“The CDC said we need to suspend that, so that’s what the Department has been doing over the last 24 hours — and I would say that it’s working,” Wolf added. “We’ve seen almost a 50% drop in illegal apprehensions, those illegal individuals coming across our borders.”
Under the border shutdown order, only certain travel is permitted — which can include travel for medical reasons, educational purposes, emergency response operations, lawful cross-border trade, and some other “essential” services. Anyone appearing at the southern border without proper documentation will be turned back.
However, there appears to be an exception to this rule regarding unlawful immigration.

The Mexican government announced that it would not accept anyone other than Mexicans and Central Americans. While these people make up a vast bulk of the illegal aliens apprehended by Border Patrol, there are still thousands of “extra-contintenal” migrants that make it to the border. These migrants can include Brazilians, Chinese, Africans and others.
CBP did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation regarding what would be done with extra-continental migrants who fall under their custody.
As of Monday morning, there have been more than 33,000 individuals in the U.S. who have tested positive for coronavirus, and at least 428 people have died from the virus. Around the globe, more than 341,000 people have tested positive and at least 15,187 have died from coronavirus-related illnesses.

Mexico's president resists coronavirus restrictions as rest of world shuts down,"(ASSOCIATED PRESS) Many countries in Latin America have taken aggressive measures to deal with the coronavirus such as closing their borders, dock and airports to foreigners, declaring states of emergencies and ordering business shutdowns.

Mexico, by contrast, has so far taken a “business as usual” attitude. People still crowd street markets picking through piles of fruit and vegetables. Cars and trucks continue to fill the streets and commuters throng subway trains, though the volume of traffic is noticeably lower.

President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and his government have said a shutdown of the country would disproportionately hurt poor people and also be a psychological weight on all Mexicans. They say there is no reason to impose major restrictions before health officials deem them necessary — a moment they are expecting in late March, based on the virus’ pattern elsewhere and the Feb. 27 date of Mexico’s first confirmed case.

""This was something that we were thrown into and we're going to handle it, and we have been handling it very well. The big decision was early when we shut down our borders. We're the first ones ever to do that. We've never done that in our country before. Or we’d have a situation that would be a lot more dire.""
Trump said the economic package will be extensive.
""Also, we're going to be seeing Small Business Administration and creating loans for small businesses. We're also working with the industries, including the airline industry, the cruise ship industry -- which, obviously, will be hit. We're working with them very, very strongly,"" he said. ""We want them to travel. We want people to travel to certain locations and not to other locations at this moment. And hopefully that will straighten out sooner rather than later.

""But the main thing is that we're taking care of the American public, and we will be taking care of the American public.""

During the news conference, Pence indicated that the need to help workers has been shared by many state governors.
""One of the things that I informed the president that I've been hearing from governors is the concern about hourly wage earners in this country feeling that they had to go to work, even if they were ill,"" Pence said.
""And the president has tasked this economic team, and is working already with leaders in the Congress, to make sure that anyone is not -- feels that they’re at risk of losing their job or losing a paycheck because they may contract the coronavirus.
""When we tell people, 'If you're sick, stay home,' the president has tasked the team with developing economic policies that will make it very, very clear that we're going to stand by those hardworking Americans, stand by those businesses large and small, and make it possible for us, as the president said from the very beginning, to put the health of America first,"" Pence said.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin later said that Trump has a range of options he can implement through the executive branch, while others may need congressional approval.
""Our primary focus is there are parts of the economy that are going to be impacted, especially workers that need to be at home -- hardworking people who are at home under quarantine or taking care of their family,"" he said.
""We'll be working on a program to address that,"" Mnuchin added.
""We will also be working with small businesses who need liquidity through SBA programs. We're looking at alternatives at the IRS. We have large tax payments coming up of providing certain relief to companies and individuals for liquidity.

""So the president is 100 percent committed that we will provide whatever tools we need, that the economy will be in very good shape a year from now.

Ocasio-Cortez warns she's 'open' to single-handedly delaying coronavirus bill 'if necessary',"Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Wednesday she might be inclined to delay passage of a $2 trillion bipartisan coronavirus stimulus package.
Senate lawmakers from both parties and the White House struck a tentative deal early Wednesday to move forward on legislation to offer relief to American workers and businesses currently being affected by nationwide shutdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic.

""At last, we have a deal. After days of intense discussions, the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday morning, NBC News reported.
""In effect, this is a wartime level of investment for our nation,” McConnell added.
""Struggling Americans are going to go to their mailboxes and find four-figure checks to help with their bills. Why? Because the Senate stepped up.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, said, ""Help is on the way, big help.""
If the deal is passed by the Senate, it could make its way to President Donald Trump’s desk quickly, with CNN reporting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told her caucus on Wednesday she would like for the House to adopt the measure by unanimous consent.

As The Hill noted, a bill can only be passed by unanimous consent if no lawmakers object.
But Ocasio-Cortez says she is currently deciding whether or not she might request a recorded, in-person vote on the relief package in the House.
The move would force House members who are not currently in Washington, D.C., to travel there to vote.
“With the health risks of travel, there is no easy choice here,” the freshman lawmaker from New York told CNN.
“But essential workers are showing up and putting their health at risk every day, and if the final text of a bill is set up to hurt them, [a recorded vote] may be something we have to do,” she added.

Ocasio-Cortez said she had not yet seen a final draft of the bill.
But ""I'm open"" to forcing a recorded vote ""if necessary,"" she said.
CNN reported that if Ocasio-Cortez decides to ask for a recorded vote, it could delay passage of the legislation by several days.
Pelosi said in a conference call with her Democratic colleagues she's discussed with the House physician's office any precautions that might need to be taken in the event of a recorded vote, a source close to congressional negations told CNN.

Axios White House reporter Alayna Treene reported Pelosi supports the bipartisan bill, but did complain it was not as far-reaching as a bill introduced by House Democrats on Monday.
“This bipartisan legislation takes us a long way down the road in meeting the needs of the American people. While the compromise does not go as far as our[s] ... the bill has moved a great deal closer to America’s workers,” Pelosi said.

Winning the coronavirus war,"America has faced great challenges in the past, and we have always gotten through them stronger than we were before. From the Civil War to the Great Depression to World War II, we have been through some horrific stuff. In the Civil War alone, we lost 750,000 people, or 2% of our population at the time. That would be 7 million deaths at our current population level. In World War II, we suffered another 405,000 deaths. Since World War II, we have faced many challenges, including wars and terrible tragedies like 9/11, but as far as the scale goes, we may be entering a period of hardship like none we have seen in decades. 
According to a Centers of Disease Control and Prevention report obtained by The New York Times, as many as 1.7 million Americans could die in the worst-case coronavirus scenario. The same report said between 2.4 million and 21 million people may need hospitalization. That's a huge problem for a country like ours, with less than a million hospital beds. 
Advertisement - story continues below
These numbers need to be put in context. First, the virus has now been around for over three and a half months, and the most recent official statistics report only 8,000 deaths worldwide. That's horrible for every single family, but on a worldwide scale, this number is small. Second, The New York Times' numbers depict the worst-case scenarios, so the real result could be a lot lower – although even the low end is 200,000 deaths. Finally, and most importantly, we can change all the numbers a lot by changing our behavior. In just this past week, we have already changed our behavior more than any of us could have imagined. There is reason for optimism.
With everyone staying home and restaurants and stores closed, our biggest challenge may be how we can keep our economy afloat. For those in the food, travel and hospitality industries, the job losses have already started. More are likely coming. The question is: Can we find a balance where our economy can continue, even if at a reduced pace, while we still minimize the disease's transmission? That won't be easy. 
Regardless of which scenario is playing out, it's crystal-clear now that we may be facing a generational challenge. Past generations of Americans stepped up when needed. This time, we don't need to go to basic training and board a ship to cross the ocean. We don't have to face a storm of Nazi machine gun fire. There are no Japanese suicide bombers. All we need to do is stay home for a while. This seems horrific by the standards of an American teen in 2020. We shouldn't minimize it. It's not fun. But it's also not a lot to ask compared with the sacrifices those who came before us have made for our country. 

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

The reality of this virus poses some interesting and scary challenges for our society. Those most at risk are the sick or elderly. Those least at risk are the young and healthy. The difference is astounding. The death rates for the oldest groups are terrifying even by historical standards. The death rates for the youngest group seem flu-like. If we don't all take care of ourselves, wash our hands and minimize contact for a while, we are all likely to get it at some point given how contagious it seems to be. But the cost of getting it will almost entirely fall on the oldest and sickest among us. So the question is whether younger Americans are willing to sacrifice for their grandparents. Videos of kids partying on spring break as they laugh about the meaninglessness of the coronavirus scare are going viral. We all have to hope those are not representative of the vast majority of young people and that more education will quickly help change attitudes. 
We are also, of course, in an election year. The reality is that after some early stumbles, it seems like the president is stepping up to lead our country through this crisis. What if, against all media and official Washington expectations, he starts to pull it off? Will Democrats and their media allies let him? 
Advertisement - story continues below
So far, the results are mixed. Some parties can't resist trying to milk this tragedy for every political point. Phony scandals ginned up by the media, like the controversy over what to call this virus, have been the norm. Is it racist to call it a Chinese virus? There can't be more than a few Americans who care about dumb debates like that at a time like this. More encouragingly, we are seeing Democrats and Republicans put partisanship aside to pass coronavirus relief bills quickly. Top Democrats like Gov. Gavin Newsom of California and Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York have recently complimented President Donald Trump for the job he and his team are doing. This sort of attitude is what people want right now from our leadership. 
A challenge like we are facing can be an opportunity for national renewal. Will young people step up to help those in need? Will politicians work together to help get America through this crisis? Will the media pull the plug on the fake controversies for at least a few months? The last one seems pretty unlikely, but two out of three wouldn't be bad.

Experts estimate coronavirus has spread to 5 times more people than China claims,"As a new mystery virus from China is taking footholds in America and other countries, one group of experts is estimating that the disease may be spreading much more rapidly than officials are letting on.
The Imperial College London's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis published the paper outlining the bombshell estimate on Friday.
Advertisement - story continues below
Although Chinese state media claims at least 300 people have been infected by the disease, named 2019-nCoV, the Imperial College estimates that there could be well over 1,700 cases.
""It is likely that the Wuhan outbreak of a novel coronavirus has caused substantially more cases of moderate or severe respiratory illness than currently reported,"" the analysis states.
The Imperial College didn't rely on simple guesswork for their paper, but hard numbers and the presence of a major airport right in the middle of the outbreak zone.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

According to the analysis, more than 3,300 international travelers make their way through Wuhan International Airport every day.
Because it takes an estimated 10 days from infection to detection of the virus, this means anyone unknowingly ill with the bug could have made their way through the airport, interacting with airport officials, vendors, and fellow travelers along the way.
Advertisement - story continues below
Since every interaction is a new opportunity for the virus, it's not hard to see how cases began popping up in Thailand, Japan, and now even the United States.
While this large discrepancy may be an oversight by China, it wouldn't be the first time the country has downplayed or outright covered up disease outbreaks.
During the SARS outbreak of the early 2000s, the communist regime failed to inform the World Health Organization about the disease. The virus spread across the globe, and the aftermath even drew a rare apology from the Chinese government.
It took over a decade before scientists finally landed on the most likely origin for the disease: a colony of bats in China.
There are still many unknowns with the new disease, and it will likely be years before we start seeing most of the answers.
Advertisement - story continues below
So far, several people have died after becoming infected with the new virus. The CDC is even publishing guidelines for healthcare professionals in an effort to identify any cases in the United States.
Authorities are speculating the disease first hit the public at a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, China, and spread from there.
While cases of the disease remain low, there's a monster on the horizon that could spell disaster for China.
Chinese New Year, by far the country's biggest celebration, begins in less than a week. People will pack the streets for parades, fireworks, and other activities.

If the Imperial College London is right in their analysis, this country-wide celebration could be coming at the worst time possible.

The media hypes youths' resilience to the virus as proof that COVID-19 is less deadly than the flu, but this simply isn't the case.

While the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 is only slightly deadly for young people, for elderly patients 80 or older the virus has a sobering 14.8 percent fatality rate in China, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
For those 70 to 79, the fatality rate remains high at a jaw-dropping 8 percent.
Because of the virus' rapid spread, everyone should be expected to do their part to mitigate the disease no matter how safe their own age group is.

Many people stocked up on hand sanitizer as fear of the virus swept America, but it turns out that ordinary soap works even better if used in a proper manner.
Palli Thordarson, a chemistry professor at Australia's University of New South Wales, explained the reasoning behind soap's efficiency in a lengthy Twitter thread.

""The soap dissolves the fat membrane and the virus falls apart like a house of cards and 'dies', or rather, we should say it becomes inactive as viruses aren’t really alive,"" Thordarson wrote Sunday.
""Disinfectants, or liquids, wipes, gels and creams containing alcohol (and soap) have a similar effects but are not really quite as good as normal soap,"" he continued.
Even with soap, careless handwashing only gives a false sense of security.

To really destroy the novel coronavirus, it's important to not only use the correct technique (here's the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation), but to do it for the proper amount of time -- 20 seconds. While this may seem difficult, there's a simple trick using songs that can make the task a fun routine.
Journalist Jen Monnier compiled a list of songs with 20-second choruses to hum or sing in your head while helping mitigate the spread of coronavirus.
You're supposed to wash your hands for 20 sec, which is the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice. But I'm tired of singing Happy Birthday and you probably are too, so I've done the very important public service of compiling other songs with roughly 20 sec choruses to sing:

It's important to remember you shouldn't be singing these out loud, which may only help spread the disease if you're an asymptomatic carrier.
Her list, and the many comments below it, contains something for almost everyone.
From Beyoncé to Fleetwood Mac, and Prince to Dolly Parton, there's hardly an excuse to cut corners with handwashing once you find the right song for you.
Along with proper handwashing, many recommend taking a sick day or simply working from home if you find yourself with symptoms of COVID-19.

While the disease may seem a trivial matter for younger people, for the nation's elderly the spread of the novel coronavirus is a dire situation. Once it makes its way into a confined space like an assisted living facility, it's not hard to see how it can easily sow destruction.
The government alone cannot be relied on to combat this outbreak in America.
It's up to every one of us to slow and stop the spread of this deadly virus.

Will media be responsible with coronavirus coverage?,"One of the first rules of weathering a crisis is to remain calm. Freaking out never helps. It's not yet clear how big of a crisis the new coronavirus will be, but panicking over even the most minor matters has become an American specialty these last few years. In our politics, we have jumped from faux crisis to faux crisis with such speed that most Americans have started tuning it out. This is not the ideal state of affairs as we prepare to enter a period of potential real crisis that could affect millions of people and result in the loss of many lives. Our country has a tradition of coming together to face crises, but this time, it's hard to imagine. Let's hope our leaders – and all of us – can rise to the challenge.
People want stable, competent leadership at a time like this. Our nation's top leaders have not excelled at displaying any of these traits the past few years. Our times have instead been marked by bickering, nasty tweets and a total lack of self-control. Many Democrats view this behavior as driven completely by President Donald Trump. Nothing could be further from the truth. The president has, of course, played a huge part, but the leaders of the Democratic Party have never treated Trump as a legitimate president. From the moment he was elected, they have tried to undermine and undercut him. Our country has suffered as a result. Nothing they can do now will remove Trump as the guy who's going to lead our country through the pandemic we are facing. It's past time for all parties to recognize that.
Advertisement - story continues below
The first step is for our top political leaders – from President Trump to Speaker Nancy Pelosi – to put the petty politics on hold and start managing this crisis. The signs here are mixed. It was good that Congress and the president were able to enact an emergency funding bill to respond to the coronavirus. It's fair for us fiscal conservatives to wonder why the amount in question had to go from the president's initial $2.5 billion request to the final bill's $8.3 billion level. There was, undoubtedly, a ton of waste added in by both parties, but it's good to see that our legislative process can still work, and it seems important that we are using about half the total spent for research and development of both vaccines and treatments. 
Besides our political leaders, the other big wild card is the media. Will the media inform the public about what we are facing, or will they set off a panic? There is always an inherent tension in the news business. Factual news coverage does not drive as many online clicks or TV eyeballs as inflammatory, bombastic coverage. Media companies have to work this balance in every story they cover. Given the political dynamic, hyping the crisis and then criticizing the response will likely harm the president, and it's hard to imagine that the press corps will cover this pandemic with any sense of fairness at all. There is nobody the average American journalist has ever loathed more than Donald Trump. The president's approval rating is already tanking, along with the stock market that he regularly sites as a barometer of his success. 
The president has argued to date that the damage from this virus is not as bad as the press and others are making it out to be. He has said he ""has a hunch"" that the death rate may be much lower than the numbers reported. The last thing anyone wants is a president acting on hunches in a time like this. It would be better if the president stopped talking that way, but his broader point is true. 

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

The quick spread of the virus, the rising number of reported infections and the drastic precautions people are taking sure are scary. However, there is still a lot we don't know. The total number of people who have died is still low compared with other causes of death. As of this writing, around 4,300 have died worldwide. Each one is a tragedy, of course, but that is a pretty small number of deaths when compared with other illnesses. The seasonal flu, for example, kills 290,000 to 640,000 people globally per year. Like the coronavirus, the vast majority of those killed by the flu have been either sick or elderly. 
The reason people worry more about the coronavirus is the 4,300 people killed are out of a total of only 118,000 confirmed cases. That's a pretty horrific death rate. But what the press fails to explain clearly is that the 118,000 number of reported cases is likely vastly understated. Many people get such a mild strain of the coronavirus that they barely notice it or confuse it with a common cold. We have likely had many multiples more than the 118,000 reported cases so far. This means that the death rate may be significantly lower than the huge 3.4% number reported by the World Health Organization. This was the point Trump was raising. All this is known and discussed by scientists, but people don't understand it because the media don't explain it clearly. Failure to communicate this sort of important matter clearly can cause a panic. Sure, that may hurt the president. It already has. But it's also hurting our country.

As a result, 69 people on the ship have been infected with the virus, including at least 12 Americans, according to USA Today.

On Saturday, Princess Cruises had announced that 63 people, including nine Americans, were infected on the ship, which was off the coast of Yokahoma, Japan.
The Princess Diamond is under quarantine until Feb. 19.
The quarantine was imposed after it was learned that a passenger on the 3,700-person ship had gone ashore in Hong Kong last month and went to the hospital.

""While on the ship, he did not visit the ship’s medical center to report any symptoms or illness,"" Princess Cruises said in a statement, according to Fox News. ""The hospital reports that he is in stable condition and the family members traveling with him remain symptom-free.""
On the ship, passengers are desperate to get home.

""We just want to get off the ship,"" she said.
In response, a State Department official said that ""once the passengers on the Diamond Princess finish their 14-day quarantine period, they will be permitted to depart Japan on commercial flights, which are readily available, and will not be subject to additional quarantine upon return to the United States,"" The Post reported.
Still, Mendizabal said being cooped up for two weeks was not easy. “It’s been very disruptive,” she said. “It’s very stressful.”

The trip turned sour for the passengers when, after arriving in port, the captain announced that the virus was on board.

"Couple vows to take decisive action, pays for entire county's coronavirus testing","A couple from Telluride, Colorado, has taken it upon themselves to pay for all the residents in their town of 2,500 to be tested for the coronavirus, and eventually the entire county of 8,000 as well.
Part-time Telluride residents Mei Mei Hu and her husband, Lou Reese, pledged to have 15,000 testing kits available, hopefully in a matter of days, according to The Colorado Sun. The kits are being created through their own company, which is a United Biomedical Inc. subsidiary. The couple is paying for the kits out of their own pockets.

The Colorado Sun reported that the new test kit is a preliminary, FDA-approved blood test.
The couple is making it possible for all residents to be tested twice over the course of the next two weeks, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms of infection.
As of Friday, San Miguel County, where Telluride is located, had one official case of the coronavirus, the Sun reported. However, the county has had little to no testing available for its residents, with several citizens suffering from severe upper respiratory infections.

Area hospitals are treating the patients with these upper respiratory infections with the same critical care as a coronavirus patient.
The Durango Herald reported that the 38 people who have already been tested, still haven't received their results. As a result of that, officials still aren't sure what to do.

“We are presuming we have disease,” spokesman Susan Lilly said. “We just don’t know how widespread it is.”
As a precautionary measure, the San Miguel County Public Health Department put its residents into a mandatory self-quarantine until mid-April. That is the state's strictest measures taken so far.
In early March, the San Miguel Sheriff Department tweeted a way for the local residents to receive the latest coronavirus updates. Of note, at the time, there were no known cases in the area.

Hu and Reese are hopeful that the tests will be successful, and will be a bridge for other communities to do something similar for their residents.
More than anything, the couple is hopeful that the testing will bring awareness to the people in San Miguel County and Telluride.

They added that many people who are infected with the coronavirus sometimes show zero symptoms, and have no idea that they are ill.
“This will be one of the first times where we screen a whole population,” Hu said.
“What you do by testing en masse is you say, ‘What is active outbreak prevalence?’ If you’re positive on antibodies, that means you’ve been exposed to it at some time. If you test again in 14 days and you see that everyone is in the same state, it means that you didn’t have any new infections and you can then begin releasing people.”
“In the event that there’s a lot, then I think it really informs the public,” Reese said.

The coronavirus originally was dubbed the ""Wuhan coronavirus"" because it was believed to have orginated in the northeastern Chinese city.

Communist Chinese authorities acknowledged that origin, but now, with the outbreak regarded as a global pandemic, they are reversing course.
Zhao Lijian, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said ""some in the media say this coronavirus is a China virus.""
""This is extremely irresponsible and we firmly oppose that. We are still tracing the origin of the virus and there is no conclusion yet,"" he said.

He acknowledged that the COVID-19 virus ""first appeared in China,"" but insisted that ""doesn’t mean its origin is in China.""
A top Trump adviser charged the Chinese Communist Party's initial efforts to cover-up and minimize the outbreak may have contributed to its global spread, the Washington Examiner reported.

""This outbreak in Wuhan was covered up. It probably cost the world community two months [during which officials could have been working to contain it],"" said National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien.
""If we'd had those [two months] and been able to sequence the virus, and had the cooperation necessary from the Chinese, had a WHO team been on the ground, had a CDC team, which we'd offered, been on the ground, I think we could have dramatically curtailed what happened both in China and what's now happening across the world,"" O'Brien said.
The The Daily Signal noted Chinese President Xi Jinping acknowledged ""the outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan.""

"Republicans oppose Democrats' coronavirus bill, point out 'major problems'","Republicans lawmakers have come out in opposition to the legislation House Speaker Nancy Pelosi planned to introduce Thursday to address the coronavirus outbreak.
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said during a news conference on Capitol Hill that Pelosi's bill, which went to the Rules Committee at 11 p.m. Wednesday night, ""comes up short.""
Advertisement - story continues below
He argued it was rushed and has some ""major problems.""
The first problem McCarthy identified was the paid family leave the legislation proposes.
""Under Pelosi’s bill, the Social Security Administration will be set up to administer the paid sick leave program,"" he said. ""This will take six months, so it won’t work in time. It also will hamper the administration from putting out Social Security for those who need it right now in harm’s way.""

""This will hurt the very population that we’re supposed to be helping,"" McCarthy added. ""It forces permanent paid sick leave for all businesses without exemptions and no sunsets.""
The coronavirus has had its greatest impact among the elderly population.

The minority leader noted that because the law has no sunset provision, its paid sick leave provision places an unfunded mandate on businesses that could go on in perpetuity.
Pelosi's bill dictates 14 days of paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave.
Another problem McCarthy identified with the legislation are changes to the unemployment benefits program.
The California congressman argued that with the nation experiencing its lowest unemployment rate in 50 years the focus should be on keeping people in their jobs.

The Republicans are proposing an employee retention tax credit to incentivize companies not to lay off or fire workers due to the impact of the coronavirus.
McCarthy further highlighted there has been no scoring for Pelosi's bill, meaning she is asking members to sign an open-ended check.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the legislation an ""ideological wish list,"" suggesting it will not be supported in the Republican-controlled chamber.
""Unfortunately, it appears at this hour that the speaker and House Democrats instead chose to produce an ideological wish list that was not tailored closely to the circumstances,"" McConnell said from the Senate floor Thursday.

“One is reminded of the famous comment from President Obama’s first chief of staff: 'You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,'"" he added.

Nevertheless, Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg said of Trump: ""There's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. And he's defunded — he's defunded Centers for Disease Control, CDC, so we don't have the organization we need. This is a very serious thing.""

""Bloomberg is repeating the false allegation in a new ad that states the U.S. is unprepared for the virus because of 'reckless cuts' to the CDC. Trump's budgets have proposed cuts to public health, only to be overruled by Congress, where there's strong bipartisan support for agencies such as the CDC and NIH. Instead, financing has increased.""

The New York Times reported other Democrats also have claimed that Trump isn't ""ready"" for a battle with the coronavirus.
This despite his early moves to limit travel between China and the United States. And among the tens of thousands of cases that have been documented worldwide, only a few dozen are in the United States.
Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., is insisting that money allocated for security on the nation's southern border be redirected to the virus.
""I'm going to be introducing a plan tomorrow to take every dime that the president is now taking to spend on his racist wall at the southern border and divert it to the coronavirus,"" she said.

She is unlikely, however, to get support from others in Congress and certainly the White House.
Another Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., questioned Trump’s decision to put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the administration’s response to the outbreak.
And Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has claimed the president is ill-informed regarding the virus.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., also declared the president was unprepared.

However, the AP report found the public health system ""has a playbook to follow for pandemic preparation — regardless of who's president or whether specific instructions are coming from the White House.""
""Those plans were put into place in anticipation of another flu pandemic, but are designed to work for any respiratory-borne disease.""
John Auerback of the Trust for America's Health said the CDC's response ""has been excellent, as it has been in the past.""

"U.S. preps to evacuate citizens as experts predict coronavirus virus could infect 270,000","The United States government is reportedly preparing to evacuate American citizens from Wuhan as the novel coronavirus continues to ravage the region. While China has dumped considerable resources into containing the outbreak, experts predict cases could still soar above 200,000 in less than two weeks.
Americans will be airlifted from the city as soon as possible, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Advertisement - story continues below
Wuhan, the epicenter of the deadly outbreak, has been effectively quarantined by the Chinese government. More than a dozen cities are now under travel restrictions, with over 50 million people in the affected area.
China's effort to halt the outbreak now amounts to the largest quarantine in human history.
According to the communist regime's most current numbers, more than 1,400 people have been confirmed as having contracted the extremely viral disease.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

The coronavirus now has a presence in countries across four continents, including the United States.
While the official number of infected may seem low, many have speculated that China is downplaying the size of the outbreak.
Advertisement - story continues below
One study estimates that the communist regime has identified only 5 percent of infected people, meaning there could be over 10,000 untested people with the virus. With those numbers, the study predicted as many as 270,000 people could be infected by early February, mere days from now.
Considering everything we've learned about the coronavirus so far, that astronomical number doesn't seem so far-fetched.
Official numbers could be low because of a reported lack of test kits. No test kit means that even a seemingly obvious case of infection may not make the official count.
To make matters worse, not all cases present symptoms. Some people have even reportedly dropped dead from the Wuhan virus without even breaking a fever. Since many nations are attempting to identify infected individuals with temperature checks, this means the disease could possibly evade health checkpoints with ease.
The extent of the virus' traits are not fully known yet.
Advertisement - story continues below
One expert who contracted the illness speculates he caught it though his unprotected eyes, according to the South China Morning Post.
If this is truly a trait of the virus, it means even those wearing the best surgical masks are at risk of infection without adequate eye protection.
Of course, the real X factor in any outbreak is human response, and people's reaction to the Wuhan virus was no different.
When news of the virus' rapid spread first broke, residents rushed to stores, airports, and hospitals. Many went unprepared, and it's likely that the packed conditions only helped the outbreak spread.

Take a look at the video below, taken at the Wuhan Tianhe International Airport just before the quarantine. Notice how many people are not wearing masks, and how virtually no one has eye protection?

Multiple Republican senators, including John Barrasso of Wyoming, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Roy Blunt of Missouri called for the move, The Hill reported.
The House is slated to vote on new coronavirus legislation, backed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, on Thursday.
Advertisement - story continues below
According to a news release from the speaker's office, ""The Families First Coronavirus Response Act"" includes, free coronavirus testing; paid emergency leave (with 14 days paid sick leave and up to three months of paid family and medical leave); ""enhanced unemployment insurance"" benefits; expansion of food stamps, student meal and seniors nutrition programs; and increased funding to Medicaid.
At a news conference on Thursday morning, Pelosi said House Democrats are actively negotiating with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.
""[H]e had some suggestions. All very reasonable,"" she said. ""I don’t think that any of them is a -- would prevent us from moving forward with the bill.""
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Thursday Pelosi's bill has some ""major problems.""
One issue McCarthy identified was the paid family leave proposal, noting it has no sunset provision and no exemptions.
Advertisement - story continues below
This means the unfunded mandate on businesses would go on in perpetuity, with no relation to the coronavirus outbreak.
Other problems McCarthy identified include changes to the unemployment benefits program.
The California congressman argued that with the nation experiencing its lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, the focus should be on keeping people in their jobs.
The Republicans are proposing an employee retention tax credit to incentivize companies not to lay off or fire workers due to the impact of the coronavirus.

McCarthy further highlighted there has been no scoring for Pelosi’s bill, meaning she is asking members to sign an open-ended check.
McConnell panned the bill in a speech from the Senate floor Thursday, calling it an ""ideological wish list.""
“Unfortunately, it appears at this hour that the Speaker and House Democrats instead chose to produce an ideological wish list that was not tailored closely to the circumstances,” McConnell said.

“One is reminded of the famous comment from President Obama’s first chief of staff: ‘You never want a serious crisis to go to waste,'” he added.
McConnell echoed McCarthy’s concern about the paid sick leave mandate the bill places on businesses, without exemptions.
The majority leader argued the provision could put “thousands of small businesses at risk,” due to their inability to afford the mandate.
Pelosi has not committed to keeping the House in session next week after voting on its coronavirus legislation.

Now, a group of researchers has figured out the molecular structure of a key protein that the coronavirus uses to invade human cells, potentially opening the door to the development of a vaccine, according to new findings.

Previous research revealed that coronaviruses invade cells through so-called ""spike"" proteins, but those proteins take on different shapes in different coronaviruses. Figuring out the shape of the spike protein in SARS-Cov-2 is the key to figuring out how to target the virus, said Jason McLellan, senior author of the study and an associate professor of molecular biosciences at the University of Texas at Austin.

Will coronavirus lead to martial law?,"I believe strongly in being prudent and also being peaceful. But I have questions – tough questions – and my purpose is to keep and embolden a strong and civil America.
COVID-19 cases are growing faster and faster by the day, and so are the numbers of those who are dying from it.
Advertisement - story continues below
As a result, a growing number of states in the U.S., like California, New York, Pennsylvania and Illinois, are asking most businesses to shut down and every citizen to ""lockdown"" or ""shelter in place,"" except for very limited ""essentials"" like running out for groceries, medicine, etc.
Interestingly, or maybe not, increasing at the same time as the above are what will be more and more law enforcement crackdowns on city-wide curfews and other citizen restrictions.
The questions I have are these: If the need for citizen confinement grows, and the restrictions increase, where does it end? And what excessive burden are we then placing upon law enforcement to corral even half of Americans (150 million)? And if even the smallest transgression of confinement restrictions ends up being a misdemeanor, how will officials handle tens of millions of them? And do we not think cops, who have to enforce confinement rules, will not come in closer proximity with those infected with the coronavirus and contract it themselves? And if those numbers continue to grow, won't we end up with the same shortage of law enforcement as we will hospital personnel? And wouldn't it follow that our courts become overloaded and burdened with misdemeanor cases just as our medical facilities are with COVID-19 cases?

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

And most critical of all, as I'm sure it is being pondered in the rooms of the White House as well as the corridors of Congress: How long can we allow Americans, who are a freedom-loving people and patriots, to be under ""lockdown"" in their own homes without working? Many scientists and specialists are even now calling the federal government to a five-week national lockdown? Do we expect the majority to simply comply? Will they have the resources and wherewithal to go the distance without resistance?
Do we not eventually expect small rebellions or even massive ones to occur in the not-so-distant future if growing requests for lockdowns and deprivations persist? And what will it take for state officials to tip over the morphing milieu of chaos to create the need themselves (based upon the pretense of protection) to call on military intervention and enact martial law? Does that really sound so far-fetched when freedom-loving Americans across our union are being asked to sacrifice their wages, their welfare and stay confined to their homes for weeks on end?
Advertisement - story continues below
If you aren't familiar with martial law, it is ""the imposition of direct military control of normal civilian functions by a government, especially in response to a temporary emergency such as invasion or major disaster, or in an occupied territory."" (Wikipedia)
Martial law is described this way in the 1942 Harvard Law Review: ""Martial law is more accurately described as martial rule, which obtain in a domestic community when the military authority carries on the government, or at least some of its functions.""
Or even more succinct, as the Military Times defined it this week: ""In simple terms, martial law is the replacement of civil rule with temporary military authority in a time of crisis.""
The Military Times went on to explain: ""Martial law can be declared by both the president and by Congress. The governor of a state may also declare martial law if it is included in that state's constitution. However, Congress has never solely imposed it.""
Of course, any rational mind is going to say: ""Martial law would never happen"" – right? You mean, just like any rational mind would also say: No single virus would ever race across the country and cause the economic engine of the United States to come to a grinding halt and the mass of people to be led into a pandemonium of fear by 24-hour news cycles that empty store shelves of toilet paper and diapers?

Even after being repeatedly asked and denying he would ever enact martial law, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo prompted many to worry as he walked down the slippery slope of calling on New York's National Guard to promote civility. Then, over the weekend, President Trump granted the governors in California, Washington and New York to call up their National Guard.
Article I, Section 6, Paragraph 1, of the military chapter of the Consolidated Laws of New York reads:
The governor shall have power, in case of invasion, disaster, insurrection, riot, breach of the peace, or imminent danger thereof, to order into the active service of the state for such period, to such extent and in such manner as he may deem necessary all or any part of the organized militia. Such power shall include the power to order the organized militia or any part thereof to function under the operational control of the United States army, navy or air force commander in charge of the defense of any area within the state which is invaded or attacked or is or may be threatened with invasion or attack.
Article I, Section 9, then takes those rules a step further:
Advertisement - story continues below
Whenever any portion of the organized militia is employed pursuant to section six of this chapter, the governor, if in his judgment the maintenance of law and order will thereby be promoted, may by proclamation declare the county or city in which the troops are serving or any specified portion thereof, to be under martial rule.
Sunday before last, four days before his basic universal moratorium on social activity for 40 million Californians, Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a press conference that martial law was not necessary to combat coronavirus in his state. At least, that is what he hopes.
He added, ""If you want to establish a framework of martial law, which is ultimate authority and enforcement, we have the capacity to do that, but we are not feeling at this moment that is a necessity.""
It's those three small words, ""at this moment,"" that prompt every Constitution-loving, Second Amendment gun-toting American to quiver in his boots.
Advertisement - story continues below
Do government officials think it is a pure coincidence that there is again another run on guns and ammunition across the U.S.? So, are Americans paranoid, or just preparing?
Notice how one Oakland, California, gun shop owner responded to the Golden State governor's call to remain indoors and non-essential businesses to close, according to WGN-TV:
Alameda County Sheriff's Sgt. Ray Kelley said Thursday that a gun shop called Solar Tactical remains open, despite the order. He said officers have advised the shop to close.
""We'll start out nice,"" Kelley said. ""Then we'll post a notice to close, and then we will take enforcement.""
Solar Tactical did not answer phone calls nor immediately respond to messages sent through its website. A message on its Facebook page said the store is now operating on an appointment-only basis and urged customers to call local police to protest the effort to close it.
""Your Second Amendment right is no longer considered essential during forced shelter in place,"" the shop said. ""Please share and get the word out. Call your local officials, news stations, and Alameda County Sheriffs office to let them know how you feel about your Second Amendment rights being taken away.""
Are political leaders listening, really? Just because you're right on an issue or even fighting for a cause like disease prevention, doesn't mean the end outcome isn't inciting division. Think!

I would highly suggest our state and national leaders rethink what are ""essentials"" or even what are perceived as essentials to warrant mobility and commerce, and they should include not restricting our constitutional Bill of Rights. In my opinion, that will inevitably and eventually lead to mayhem.
The Military Times asked this simple question this past week: ""Will Coronavirus lead to Martial Law?""
At the end of the article, this was the answer: ""For now, no major mobilizations have occurred, and the power to call up the National Guard remains with the states, including for drill weekends and other duties.""
""I trust the [state adjutants general] will continue to make decisions at their level to ensure our force of 450,000 people will be ready when their governors call,"" said Gen. Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau, in a press release last Monday.

I'm not trying to make anyone panic. Really. My wife, Gena, and I are not panicked at all. But we are prudent, and we've seen these tea leaves before. Anyone remember the modern-day tea party movement? Dare I add, the older Boston Tea Party? They might not have rallied around viruses, but they did protest against being pushed too far and having their freedoms restricted for too long.
Americans have a tipping point, let there be no doubt about it. We haven't traveled our two centuries of freedom-loving progress, filled with wars and veterans who have shed life and limb, to regress and be placed into liberty-inhibiting shackles. We're not there yet, I agree, but I would doubly caution state and federal leaders from asking citizens to go beyond that which they are able or capable.
Americans are and will lovingly sacrifice to stop the spread of a disease, and especially to keep others who are ""weak"" from being infected by it. That's also what makes the greatness and goodness of Americans.
But the leaders of our communities, states and country need to remember and never forget that old historical adage: ""Learn from history or you'll be doomed to repeat it."" It's a slippery slope to socialism, and the same slope slips to tyranny, even if you're doing great things like battling diseases.

The final eviction notice came just days after he was accused of domestic violence.

It was two months after the moment which signaled the beginning of the end for Stormy Daniels' former lawyer -- his representation of Julie Swetnick, a woman who made wild accusations of gang-rape and drugging against then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
And yet, as Avenatti's firm was kicked out of the building for non-payment of $213,254 in rent, according to the Los Angeles Times, he was still talking about running for president.
Avenatti is now a jailbird, having been convicted in February of trying to extort athletic-wear giant Nike for $25 million over alleged improprieties involving collegiate athletes.

“I think he’s in a bit of a state of shock,” Avenatti attorney Danya Perry told reporters after the conviction, according to CNBC. “But he’s a fighter, as you all know, and he’s staying strong.”
He'd better be.

He's locked up in New York City's Metropolitan Correctional Center, the last known earthly home of Jeffrey Epstein and a significantly different set of digs than his former law offices.
In fact, it's bad enough that Avenatti attorney Scott Srebnick wants a 30-day delay in a pre-sentencing interview because of health concerns -- including COVID-19 transmission.
According to the New York Post, Srebnick complained of the unsanitary conditions in a letter to a New York judge.
“Mr. Avenatti’s cell was infested with rats. The jail reeks or urine. As of yesterday, Mr. Avenatti had not shaved in weeks. Meanwhile, across the country, public officials are declaring states of emergency as a result of the spread of the coronavirus,” the letter read.
“Health officials are uncertain of the actual risks. And, by all accounts, a prison facility poses among the highest risks of spread of infection.

“Given the uncertainty regarding the coronavirus, the ease with which it spreads, and the documented unsanitary conditions at the MCC-New York, I am requesting that the … background interview be adjourned,” he added.
Avenatti is in the Manhattan jail for the foreseeable future.
He has a pre-sentencing hearing in June.
He also has another federal case in Manhattan, this time for allegedly defrauding Stormy Daniels, the former adult film star and alleged Trump paramour who turned out to be Avenatti's meal ticket.

The MCC is a genuinely ghastly place and a blight on the reputation of the Federal Bureau of Prisons; it's impossible to take joy in Avenatti's stay there.
Even if the disgraced lawyer's privations were blandished by his counsel, those familiar with the jail know it's a 19th-century nightmare of Dickensian proportions.
That said, it's impossible to stress how complete Avenatti's fall from grace has been -- and how completely everyone who wanted to fell for his act.
Avenatti became omnipresent right about the time the left decided the best way to cantilever Trump out of the Oval Office involved nabbing him on alleged campaign finance violations.

These involved payments he made during the campaign, albeit with his personal money, to obtain non-disclosure agreements from women who accused him of having affairs with them.
Enter Avenatti, flamboyant and omnipresent, seemingly popping up on CNN and MSNBC at will, as if he were a man who had a personal Hyperloop between the two studios.
According to NewsBusters, the two cable networks gave the lawyer no less than 230 interviews in a year.
Avenatti himself became the story, which was a problem for Daniels, considering the left has the attention of a gnat and the campaign finance angle didn't quite work out for them.

He found more ways of getting himself in the media eye, including floating a run for the presidency.
This was taken seriously by cable news media. A man who shot to fame as Stormy Daniels' lawyer was suddenly seen at the border protesting familial separation or in Iowa for reasons it didn't take too long to suss out.
The mainstream media ate it up.
Yet, in this August 2018 segment from MSNBC's ""Deadline: White House,"" panelists were mostly convinced this was something to be taken seriously.

“If they decide they value a fighter most, people would be foolish to underestimate Michael Avenatti,” host Nicolle Wallace said.
“You look at the field of Democrats right now, and Avenatti’s the one who stands out. He’s the one who’s not a politician,” Philip Rucker, no less than The Washington Post’s White House bureau chief, opined.
“If he gives the base what they’re looking for and shows that he can go toe-to-toe with Trump, he’d have a chance.”

If you thought Marianne Williamson was entertaining, just imagine what Avenatti would have been like on the debate stage.
Alas, that wasn't to be.
Avenatti's downfall began in September 2018 with the strange case of Julie Swetnick, the third woman to officially allege Brett Kavanaugh sexually abused her during his contentious confirmation hearings.
It quickly became apparent that Swetnick's claims were outlandish, and even Democrats, who had tolerated Avenatti's act thus far, began to turn on him, claiming Swetnick had hurt their chances to torpedo the Supreme Court nominee.

Then came the domestic violence allegations that November (no charges were ever filed) and the eviction notice.
Stormy Daniels would eventually turn on him, as would the media.
Then came his arrest for extorting Nike, then more charges, then his conviction on three counts of extortion, wire fraud and transmission of interstate communications with intent to extort.
It's not that I take joy in the fact that Avenatti has been reduced to an apparently unshaven state in a rat-infested jail that his lawyer says is a coronavirus breeding ground. It's that this was all so predictable.
Advertisement - story continues below
From the start, Avenatti's stoat-like visage should have tipped viewers off to the fact they were watching one of the most unctuous cultural ambulance chasers in recent memory.
Even after early profiles noted he was a bit of a bounder in his private life and spent money as fast as it came in -- particularly money earmarked for Stormy Daniels' legal case -- nobody seemed to mind.
Look! There's Avenatti on CNN again! I love that oily wit and pugnacious attitude! #Basta, President Trump! Right.
And look how that ended -- how any clear-eyed person could have predicted it would have. Perhaps a bit lower than one might have expected, but the disgrace and penury were always part of the equation for those who cared to look.

Terrifying video shows how socialist health care and Chinese authorities deal with coronavirus victims,"Pandemic fears continued to rattle global markets Tuesday, with official statistics revealing total worldwide cases of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) have surged to at least 80,067, CNN reported.
Accounting for nearly 97 percent of those cases, China, the known epicenter for the global outbreak, has suffered far and away the most as coronavirus begins to grip the globe -- not only in terms of public health and economics but in terms of social stability as well.

From empty Shanghai metros to the citywide spraying of airborne disinfectants, the clubbing of stray animals by hazmat teams to the Chinese Communist Party's raiding of potential virus carriers' homes, social fallout has been dramatic throughout the massive East Asian nation.
And judging from a recently released video filmed in Henan province, forcible apprehension of suspected patients by government actors just might stand to increase in the coming weeks, as SWAT teams have begun publicly training to detain ""uncooperative"" carriers.


Riot shields, fishing nets, spike strips and disinfectant.
It's a strange list of equipment for a 21st-century law enforcement operation, but it would seem that is what highly trained officers on the ground in the region are working with as the Chinese government seeks to prevent further disease transmission.

Released Monday morning by ABC News, the now widely available video shows Chinese officials have gone so far as to draw up plans for multitiered roadblocks and four-man arrest strategies in anticipation of the odd infected flight risk.
The apprehension seems, for all intents and purposes, to be a two-stage process.
First, authorities head off the fleeing patient, stopping his vehicle with tire spikes or armored police vans. Then, once the patient is forced out of the vehicle, the arrest team closes in.
Clothed in teal hazmat gear and headed up by a shield-carrying officer, the SWAT team closes in, catching the patient's head in a fishing net and physically securing the individual.
As the potential patient is handcuffed by restraining officers, the net is removed, and video seems to reveal another officer will close in from the front and bag the individual's face in a black head covering -- though the position of other arresting officers obscures the detail.

Nothing says comforting like mass, militarized arrests as a national solution for global health epidemics, am I right?

That's a rhetorical question, of course.
There is absolutely nothing comforting about the fact that a nation responsible for at least three major zoonotic outbreaks in the last two decades -- and ruled by the iron fist of a communist regime -- cannot seem to get its act together when it comes to public health.
Far less comforting, however, is the fact that, particularly in light of the Nevada Democratic caucus this weekend, the American left seems to be growing increasingly fond of leaders with a sense of nostalgia for the 20th-century revolutions and political messaging that created barmy communist dictatorships like the one we now see in China.

Trump has repeatedly referred to the outbreak as the ‘Chinese virus’ in an effort to have Beijing take responsibility given that their cover-up of the outbreak in its early months is what rapidly accelerated the current global pandemic.

Walmart significantly shortens hours in response to coronavirus,"Walmart is adapting to the retail world framed by America's battle against the coronavirus by reducing hours at many stores.
Effective Thursday, many of Walmart's 4,700 US stores were open from 7 a.m. until 8:30 p.m., according to a Walmart blog post. Stores that currently open after 7 a.m. will continue to do so.

""This will further help associates restock the shelves for customers while continuing to clean and sanitize the store,"" Walmart executive vice president and Chief Operating Officer Dacona Smith wrote. ""While the store hours change for customers, our associates will continue to have access to their regular scheduled shifts and full hours.""
Walmart is following the lead of Dollar General, Target and other stores by offering a special senior citizen shopping time.
""From March 24 through April 28, Walmart stores will host an hour-long senior shopping event every Tuesday for customers aged 60 and older. This will start one hour before the store opens. Our Pharmacies and Vision Centers will also be open during this time,"" Smith wrote.

A massive spike in demand has cleaned many stores of products that shoppers consider critical.
As a result, Smith said Walmart stories will be imposing limits on how much of key items shoppers can buy.

""Our stores will have limits for customers in certain categories including paper products, milk, eggs, cleaning supplies, hand sanitizer, water, diapers, wipes, formula and baby food,"" Smith wrote.
In Britain, the grocery chain Aldi has imposed an across the-board limit on shoppers.
Customers are not allowed to buy more than four of any one item.
Walmart, meanwhile, has also shut down its automotive centers for the time being, shifting employees who worked there to help stock and clean stores.
And the chain's vision centers will be providing ""essential services only such as glasses repair and helping customers pick up existing orders,"" Smith wrote.

In the post, Smith praised the efforts of Walmart workers in responding to unprecedented demand.
“Our associates have been nothing short of heroic in their commitment to serve customers, stock shelves as quickly as possible and keep their stores clean,"" Smith wrote.

Walmart's stock has risen along with consumer demand, according to CNBC, which reported that the retailer's shares have risen 2 percent at the same time the S&P 500 has fallen 25 percent.

This is apparently the lesson we're supposed to take away from officials in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, the jurisdiction in which the city of Cleveland is located. Ohio's second-most populous county has decided to release hundreds of inmates from the Cuyahoga County jail over COVID-19 fears.

Here's the thing -- not a single person in the jail was known to be infected.

Earlier in the week, Administrative Judge Brendan Sheehan told the station many of the inmates were in poor health, which he said made it a potential breeding ground for COVID-19.
According to CNN, more than 200 inmates were released from the jail out of a population of 1,970.

Almost any kind of inmate was up for release as well.
“You gotta remember, the goal of this is to protect the community and the safety of the inmates,"" Sheehan said.
""If someone’s a serious violent person, well, we’re using our discretion to make sure the community’s safe also,"" he said.
Sheehan also said he was making room for a possible quarantine.

""We are trying to make as much room as possible, so when this virus hits our jail, the jail can deal with these people, quarantine them and deal with it instead of letting them sit there and infect the whole entire jail,"" he said.

Surprisingly, Sheehan and his squad are less liberal on this than ""squad"" member Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts.
Somehow, in between the time he spends ministering to his sick and housebound flock during this no doubt trying COVID-19 crisis, noted cleric the Rev. Al Sharpton managed to tape a TV show for MSNBC on Saturday in which Pressley was a guest. During her appearance, the first-term congresswoman said prisoners should be given compassionate release -- and she was advocating for it with two fellow squad members and another liberal Democrat.
“This pandemic, COVID-19, has certainly highlighted and exacerbated every socio, ratio, political fault line in our country,"" Pressley said.
""And I'm just advocating to make sure that when we are talking about those that are most vulnerable, our low-income residents and citizens, those experiencing homelessness, our seniors, that we are also including the incarcerated men and women, who are certainly amongst one of the most vulnerable populations.

She went on to ask whether prisoners had been tested for coronavirus and what the quarantine measures were.
Advertisement - story continues below
The amazing thing is that this stance isn't much different from Pressley's default position. In other words, she and others are using coronavirus as an excuse to push policy positions. Never let a good crisis go to waste.
Saying that this is problematic isn't for a lack of compassion for prisoners. If someone doesn't need to be in prison, he shouldn't be. The problem is that, as we've seen in many disastrous bail reform initiatives -- a new favorite cause of the left -- the people who often pursue this sort of thing under the aegis of criminal justice reform have a different definition of who needs to be behind bars than, say, reality does.
This is what panic looks like. Hasty, quick pleas to get jailed people back out on the street aren't necessarily going to help anything -- especially when and if the first of these individuals is arrested for something unseemly and we have the opposite argument.
Cuyahoga County isn't alone. In Los Angeles, they're reducing arrests from an average of 300 a day to 60 because of coronavirus. This is somehow supposed to keep people safe.

""We're protecting the public and the safety of the inmates,"" Sheehan told CNN. ""That's really our goal.""
I wouldn't be quite so sure about that first part, judge. With no known cases in the jail and 200 inmates back out on the street after quickie pleas or house arrest arrangements, this might mean a small portion of the inmate population is less likely to get COVID-19, a disease no one in the prison had tested positive for. (Sorry about the other 1,700 still in there.)
As for the rest of the residents of Cuyahoga County, I'd like him to explain how this makes them safer.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin -- who negotiated the deal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in consultation with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- said at a news briefing Saturday that the federal government is still in the ""second inning"" of its response to the coronavirus, indicating economic stimulus measures may follow including cutting the payroll tax.
""We have a lot more we need to do with Congress,"" Mnuchin said. ""The speaker and I have acknowledged it.""
However, Paul Winfree -- an economic expert at the Heritage Foundation and former director of budget policy in the Trump White House -- opposed a broad-based stimulus move such as cutting the payroll tax, which funds the Social Security program.
“Any policy response should be targeted and temporary -- and tied to addressing the underlying crisis of the viral attack and the actual problems American families may face as a result,” he said in a statement to The Western Journal.
“A payroll tax cut is the type of tool that might address a recession, so it’s probably not the best tool to use to combat a pandemic,"" Winfree added. ""Moreover, a payroll tax cut does not assist those who help to minimize the public health risk by staying at home rather than reporting to work during the epidemic.""
Advertisement - story continues below
The Cato Institute's Ryan Bourne agreed, arguing ""there’s no case for a big payroll tax cut through November’s election, as President Trump seems to want.""
""The key challenge is how to ease liquidity constraints binding on households and businesses which would suffer the biggest losses of income if demand for their services collapses or their activities were required to be temporarily paused,"" the economist explained.
Bourne advocated ""for targeted measures that help otherwise viable businesses from going under or provide a degree of security for workers or contractors who would otherwise have perverse incentives to continue working even if sick.""
American Enterprise Institute's Desmond Lachman -- who served as deputy director in the International Monetary Fund’s Policy Development and Review Department -- told The Western Journal he is fully supportive of federally funded paid sick leave.
Advertisement - story continues below
""The idea (is) that you need paid sick leave right now,"" he said. ""You need that in order to contain the spread of this coronavirus. What you don’t want is you don’t want people going into work sick, and they’re going into work sick because they can’t afford to lose their pay.""
However, Lachman disagrees with both Winfree and Bourne regarding cutting the payroll tax.
""The best side of support that can come from the budget side is if you can get the money into the economy very quickly,"" he contended.
Hadley Heath Manning, policy director for the Independent Women's Forum, hopes Congress does not open the federal coffers too far in its desire to ""do something.""

""[L]awmakers shouldn’t blindly throw money and mandates at the problems they see without thinking strategically about the secondary or tertiary effects of their actions,"" Manning said in a statement to The Western Journal. ""Relief should be targeted to those who need it most.""
""My greatest hope is that we will all, as individuals, rise to the occasion by reaching out in our neighborhoods to help one another,"" she added. ""This type of local, voluntary, private response will ultimately be more effective and more powerful than any government program.""
Lachman encouraged Trump to also keep the world economy in mind as he fashions the U.S. economic response.
""The United States is part of the global economy,"" the financial expert said. ""So if things go really wrong abroad that’s going to affect us as well. So the best case is everybody is doing the right sort of thing, and the United States is providing leadership for a coordinated approach to what’s a global problem.""

A plague killing off Playboy is almost like something you'd read in the Bible and not in The New York Times.
The only bleak side, really, is that you have to read Mr. Kohn write sentences like this about the magazine's legacy: ""Throughout the past sixty-six years, one thing has remained constant: our commitment to free expression and breaking taboos, leaning into discomfort, helping audiences express and understand their sexuality, and advocating for the pursuit of pleasure for all.""
This is the party line Hugh Hefner and his acolytes constantly use to explain themselves.
It's Playboy's ridiculous origin story: Before the magazine came along in 1953, it goes, none of us derived any pleasure from sexuality. My word, what a chore the opposite sex was. You had to woo them, and for what?
None of us were attracted to each other by any sort of biological drive.

No, nothing like that -- the whole thing was a culturally mandated millstone. Once ensnared in that dastardly ritual of pairing called marriage, we went on a honeymoon to play chess, or whatever.
Then we decided we had to procreate because, hey, I guess the species needs to survive. So we asked one of our religious elders how we went about that sort of thing and he told us the whole abhorrent process.
So, feeling nauseous, we went home, closed our eyes and thought of England (or America, or whatever sovereign nation state we were in).
Then, a family arrived. Poof! Now we had a lot of dreary responsibility until the next time we had to get on with furthering the human race.

Then came swingin' Hef in 1953. With his pipe and his bathrobe, he burst on the scene telling us: ""Psst! Good news, cats. This all doesn't have to be boring! Also, you don't have to be dragged down by all of that cultural nonsense that's developed over the past few millennia! Just, you know, feel free, be groovy and don't get hung up.""
And thus did the sexual revolution begin and nothing bad ever came of it. Great times were had by all. The end.
No. That's not how it worked.
As a people, we knew perfectly well what sex was, thank you.

We knew not only that there was a time and a place for it -- and hopefully we knew that time and place was within the bounds of wedlock -- we were much more than willing to make time and have a place for it.
Playboy needn't have relayed that information to anyone.
What Playboy did, instead, was to mainstream pornography under the aegis of it being a lifestyle -- a lifestyle which removed emotion and love from human sexuality and instead packaged it as nothing more than an animal reaction to indulge in.
But not just that.
Advertisement - story continues below
If you subscribed to Playboy at the beginning, you weren't just lusting after airbrushed women on a page while you sat idly in the same home you had before you subscribed to Playboy.
You weren't just looking at stuff that heretofore would have been sold in dingy underground shops by men in stained raincoats. No, this was high-class, glossy entertainment interspersed with interviews, recommendations on jazz and suggestions for the perfect bachelor pad. You were hip. With it. You ""read it for the articles,"" tee hee.
What Playboy mainstreamed quickly morphed into the adult film industry -- which could still market itself as a lifestyle thing, this one immersed in the moral (or rather, amoral) atmosphere of the 1970s.
""Deep Throat,"" after all, became the name of the most famous whistleblower in American history.
Advertisement - story continues below
As the Times of London noted, even Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis went to see the movie and, depressingly, more people in a 1985 poll recognized the name of ""Deep Throat"" star Linda Lovelace than they did the name Henry Kissinger.
It was more difficult to call what sprang from that a ""lifestyle"" unless you embraced rank dissolution as a ""lifestyle.""
Even before internet smut took off in the 1990s, you had effluence like Hustler and the low-rent stuff your video store used to keep behind a curtain.
However, there's still a direct concatenation of events that links Playboy to the porn of today, a tawdry drug in which desperate, joyless individuals engage in dreary, mechanical acts so that people (mostly men) across the world don't have to acknowledge -- or even find -- their partner.

No liberation has been bequeathed upon us by Playboy.
Instead, its legacy will be a corporatized behemoth of adult ""entertainment"" which has inured us to actual romance and intimacy while creating all sorts of egregious externalities.
While it's unknown just how big the porn industry is nowadays, according to Quartz, it could have a bigger impact on the American economy than Netflix.
Thanks to big smut, we now live in a world where almost 90 percent of boys and 60 percent of girls are exposed to pornography before they reach 18.
Advertisement - story continues below
Divorce rates double when people start watching porn. Sex trafficking, abuse and exploitation are inseparable parts of the industry.
I could rattle these figures and facts off all day.
I won't because you already know this -- because you know people whose lives and relationships have been profoundly affected by pornography, almost without fail for the worse. You may be one of them.
Playboy was always a product by the man in the dirty raincoat.
Advertisement - story continues below
It just dressed itself up to make itself presentable to a society that knew the dangers of pornography.  Now the product is so pervasive that Playboy's progeny don't even have to undertake that ruse.
While the coronavirus finally killed the print version of Playboy off, it was those less circumspect progeny that helped mortally weaken it.
The magazine was losing $5 million a year, according to the New York Post. Why buy a magazine when you can get the same product for free online, after all?
Celebrating the passing of Playboy magazine during the coronavirus outbreak is a bit like being the condemned prisoners at the end of ""Monty Python's Life of Brian,"" all singing ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.""
Advertisement - story continues below
Indeed, as Playboy was making news by sputtering to a halt, its spiritual successor -- moral cesspool PornHub -- was also in the headlines, offering free premium membership to beleaguered Italians to ""help keep you company during these next weeks at home.""
The idea that digital smut now counts as a form of ""company"" is a sign that our inward pathogens have been incubating for a lot longer than this outward pathogen has.
And the company itself will live on, of course.
""Right now, the Playboy brand is more successful than ever before,"" Kohn wrote in his farewell letter to the print edition.
Advertisement - story continues below
""Our audience is massive. We drive over $3 billion in annual consumer spend worldwide. We reach hundreds of millions of eyeballs every year, across all genders. This past year, our focus has been on meeting audiences where they are. We gained over 4 million new Instagram followers and saw over 50% growth in engagement on our social channels in the past 6 months, grew our digital video subscriptions by almost 30% year-over-year and acquired a direct-to-consumer commerce operation that serves almost 1M active customers every month.""
There'll be plenty of web content from Playboy, and that sleazy bunny logo will doubtlessly grace plenty of apparel and other licensed goods.
However, the passing of the print edition allows us to look back at where the magazine has taken us. We're at the dead end of the primrose path where ""the pursuit of pleasure for all"" hath led.
As you look up at us, Hef, do you think it was all worth it?
Advertisement - story continues below
Do you think there's any nadir that smut has yet to sink to? Any aspect of human intimacy the pornographic medium can further despoil?
So, yes, as I'm locked down at home watching the news scroll by, I'll allow myself a bit of schadenfreude as Playboy passes into history.
Don't sell any copies of the last print edition, I say. Haul the glossy rot into a deep, dark catacomb, stack all the rags all next to a cask of amontillado and immure them all behind a wall of bricks.
Were it all to have stayed there to begin with.

Doctor: I treated 350 coronavirus patients with 100% success,"(screenshot WUSA9.com)
A physician in New York state claims he has used the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine and zinc to treat 350 patients for COVID-19 with 100 percent success.

In a video posted on YouTube, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko said he saw the symptom of shortness of breath resolved within four to six hours, the Gateway Pundit blog reported.
Zelenko, addressing his message to President Trump, said he's a board-certified family practioner in the community of Kiryas Joel in Orange County, New York, in the Hudson Valley, about 50 miles north of New York City.
""I'm seeing a tremendous outbreak in this community,"" he said. ""My estimate is more than 60% currently have the infection.

""That's based on the percentage of the tests that I'm getting back already,"" Zelenko explained. ""That's probably around 20,000 people, probably more.""

At a Fox News ""virtual townhall"" Tuesday in the Rose Garden, Vice President Mike Pence was asked by Dr. Mehmet Oz, the popular TV doctor, how the distribution of the hydroxychloroquine treatment can be accelerated.
Pence said ""there is no barrier,"" explaining the FDA already has approved ""off-label"" use, meaning the drug used to treat malaria also can be prescribed to treat COVID-19.
The vice president said the administration is working with Bayer on increasing the supply of the drug at the same time clinical trials are being conducted.
""Doctors can prescribe that medication, which, as you know, is a perfectly legal malaria medication,"" Pence said.

Oz asked Pence if he would allow himself to be treated with hydroxychloroquine if he were infected with the coronavirus.
""I would follow the advice of my physician, and I would recommend everyone do that,"" the vice president replied.
'Game changer'
Oz has called chloroquine ""the biggest game changer of all,"" with the potential of preventing the U.S. from ""becoming Italy.""

President Trump announced Monday that clinical trials for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in New York on Tuesday. He said 10,000 units of chloroquine will be distributed in the state.
Studies in China, Australia and France have found the combination of chloroquine and zithromycin treated the coronavirus within six days with a 100% success rate.
In an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity on Monday night, Dr. Peter Costantino, the chairman of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, was asked to comment on Dr. Zelenko's reported results.
""I'm very, very optimistic about this,"" he said. ""This is not a controlled study, but the number of patients represented by Dr. Zelenko is very significant.""

Costantino noted there were no hospitilizations, intubations or deaths among Zelenko's 350 patients. As many as 40 hospitalizations would have been expected, he said, along with possibly two or three deaths.

It is important to note that Ayyadurai did not say the disease is man-made or a hoax.
You should follow the guidelines from doctors, federal, state and local governments and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Advertisement - story continues below
But what Ayyadurai did say is that some in the government are using the pandemic to frighten people into obedience.
Think about what has transpired in less than a week’s time. We have handed control of nearly everything in our lives to the government.
In many places, they are telling us when we can leave our homes and when we must return to them.
They have decided what events or religious services we can attend, how many people are allowed to be there and which businesses are allowed to stay open.
In the process, the global economy has crashed with the assistance of the media stirring everyone into a mass panic.

People are hoarding and fighting over toilet paper as if it is the cure for COVID-19 and grabbing every canned and dry food they can find.
Again, this is a very real disease and it can be dangerous, particularly to those who are immunocompromised or elderly.
That said, the panic shopping and fear that many of us feel are not helping any of us.
Is Ayyadurai incorrect? If a vaccine for coronavirus was available tomorrow, do you not believe that the government could, and would, mandate that everyone get it?
Advertisement - story continues below
Many of us would be thrilled to have it. But what about the people who decided that they would not take the vaccine?
Many schools and workplaces already mandate the flu shot. Now imagine the government requiring that citizens take the medicine they are told to.
If it could do that, what else could it force you to do next year? Next decade? Next century?
We all want to be safe, and we want you to be safe and follow the guidelines as we do not know what we are dealing with.

But it would also be wise to be vigilant and see the bigger picture.
The doctor could be way off base, but if he isn’t, that is a frightening prospect.

President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign is calling on Twitter to apply its new “Manipulated Media” label to a video former Vice President Joe Biden retweeted before the rule was instituted.
The company should apply the label to a March 3 video containing two clips “spliced together to fabricate a quote and give viewers the false impression that he called the coronavirus a ‘hoax,'” Trump campaign chief operating officer Michael Glassner wrote in a letter Monday to Twitter.

Twitter has previously noted that it will not flag content that was posted before March 5, when the company officially rolled out the label.
The offending Biden video also repeats a claim the former vice president made at the outset of his campaign asserting that Trump called white supremacists at a Virginia rally in 2017 “very fine people,” Glassner added in the letter, which came a day after Twitter applied the label to a Trump video.
White House social media director Dan Scavino criticized Twitter Monday for labelling the video “manipulated media.” His version of the video showed Biden bumbling while articulating a point, telling an audience in Missouri: “Excuse me. We can only reelect Donald Trump.”
The unedited video shows the former vice president saying: “Excuse me. We can only reelect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. It’s gotta be a positive campaign.” Scavino maintained that the video was edited, “NOT manipulated.”
Trump’s team is describing Twitter as another arm of the Biden campaign.

“The Biden campaign is scared as hell that voters will see the flood of unedited and embarrassing verbal stumbles that will continue go viral if ‘Status Quo Joe’ is the nominee,” Trump campaign rapid response director Andrew Clark told Fox News Monday.
He added: “Twitter shouldn’t be an enforcement arm of Joe Biden’s campaign strategy, but if they choose to police every video clip they must hold his own campaign to the same standard.” Trump’s letter comes out the same day a report highlighted that Biden is giving short speeches to limit possible gaffes.

CDC: Coronavirus can survive on surfaces for at least 17 days,"The coronavirus can survive on surfaces for at least 17 days, according to a study released Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The new data came from a study of the COVID-19 outbreaks on the Diamond Princess ship off the coast of Japan and the Grand Princess ship off the coast of California.
Advertisement - story continues below
Passengers and crew members on both ships were quarantined on board after previously asymptomatic guests tested positive for the coronavirus once they landed onshore.
Researchers found traces of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, ""on a variety of surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers up to 17 days after cabins were vacated on the Diamond Princess but before disinfection procedures had been conducted.""
The data couldn't confirm if the virus was transmitted from the contaminated surfaces, and the CDC called for further studies of the transmission of the disease aboard cruise ships.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

""COVID-19 on cruise ships poses a risk for rapid spread of disease, causing outbreaks in a vulnerable population, and aggressive efforts are required to contain spread,"" the CDC wrote.
Previous research from the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton University had found that the coronavirus can live for up to three days on plastic and stainless steel, with the amount of the virus left on the surfaces decreasing over time.
Advertisement - story continues below
Despite the longer survival time of COVID-19 on surfaces, the CDC still says the virus is mainly spread from person to person.
""It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads,"" the federal agency says.
At the time of the Diamond Princess outbreak in February, it was the largest cluster of confirmed COVID-19 cases outside of mainland China.
The Diamond Princess and Grand Princess had 800 total COVID-19 cases, including 10 fatalities.
""Public health responses to COVID-19 outbreaks on cruise ships were aimed at limiting transmission among passengers and crew, preventing exportation of COVID-19 to other communities, and assuring the safety of travelers and responders,"" the CDC wrote.
Advertisement - story continues below
At the time of the outbreaks on the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess, authorities implemented aggressive efforts to contain transmission on board in order to prevent the virus from being spread when passengers were able to disembark.
Passengers on the Diamond Princess were quarantined in their cabins for 14 days before they disembarked.
After several days quarantined on the ship while it was docked in Oakland, passengers on the Grand Princess were transported to federal quarantine facilities to complete a 14-day quarantine period.
As of Tuesday morning, there have been more than 398,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins.

That's the question Dr. Jane Orient, the president of Physicians for Civil Defense, is raising in a WND column.
Asserting China's communist regime cannot be trusted to tell the truth, she says the coronavirus ""may be unstoppable in China by now,"" but ""protecting the rest of the world requires vigilance and free communication.""
She notes China's Ministry of Public Security ordered all police departments throughout the nation to make ""wartime preparations."" The police are to help ""control the disease"" by enforcing quarantine orders and helping to speed the distribution of medical supplies.

Significantly, police are to maintain ""social stability"" by ""severely"" punishing any public or online reporting about the spread of the epidemic.
Orient notes the Chinese government censors quickly deleted a Twitter post that said the Wuhan city government and Hubei Provincial Civil Affairs Ministry ""have dispatched vehicles, staff, and protective gear to each funeral house"" in the city.

The post offered ""free cremation for the corpses of coronavirus victims"" who died on Jan. 26 or later.
Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced Friday that the coronavirus has been declared a public health emergency in the U.S.
Azar said that beginning at 5 p.m. on Feb. 2, U.S. citizens returning from Hubei province will be subject to a 14-day quarantine, FoxNews.com reported. Other Americans who traveled elsewhere in China will be instructed to self-monitor for possible symptoms.
The quarantine is the first such order in more than 50 years.
The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. remains at seven, according to officials.

2/3 of Americans would turn down free cruise amid coronavirus,"(STUDY FINDS) -- NEW YORK — The ongoing saga of the novel coronavirus feels like a bad dream, and we’re all waiting to wake up. Unfortunately, if recent events and headlines are anything to go on, it seems things in the United States may get worse before they get better. The coronavirus may not be the harbinger of the apocalypse that some reports are making it out to be, but it’s a serious health concern nonetheless. Whether it’s the flu, coronavirus, or any other winter ailment, Americans all over the country are suddenly being faced with the reality that it is at least possible that they’ll come down with an illness in the near future.
With that in mind, the results of a recent survey of 1,013 Americans paints a rather unprepared picture. Conducted by GOBankingRates, the research found that half of respondents have absolutely no savings in the event they come down with an illness and can’t work. That could be a big problem with coronavirus apparently poised to break into the U.S. in a big way.

Respondents were asked about a number of coronavirus related topics, with most being centered around finance. For now, at least, 90% said their pockets aren’t any lighter due to the virus. That may change in the coming weeks and months, though, with coronavirus already wreaking havoc on the global financial scene.

Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, is awaiting the results of a coronavirus test she took Friday after experiencing flu-like symptoms, a spokesman for the party said Saturday.
“Last night, Chairman McDaniel began experiencing a fever and flu like symptoms,” RNC Communications Director Michael Ahrens said in a statement.

President Donald Trump announced at a press conference earlier Saturday that he took a test for coronavirus, or COVID-19, on Friday night. At least three members of a delegation from Brazil who met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago earlier in March tested positive for COVID-19, which has caused more than 5,000 worldwide.
Trump said he is not feeling any symptoms.

McDaniel had several interactions with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence last and earlier this week.
An RNC official told reporters she was with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, March 6. She attended an event with Pence the next day. On Monday, March 9, she flew back with Trump on Air Force One. She returned to her home in Michigan on Tuesday, the official said.

"Media figures echo Chinese propaganda on coronavirus, claim it's racist if they don't","Linking China with the virus that is now stirring panic around the world -- regardless of the fact that it started there -- is now being denounced as racist
Until recently, there was little doubt that the coronavirus responsible for school closings and the cancellations of reams of events first sickened people in Wuhan, China.

China said so, over and over.
But now, China is bristling when it is linked with what is increasingly being seen as a global calamity.
And so, too, are media figures who are repeating the Chinese Communist Party line.

In fact, China is taking the official line that it could be blameless.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, when asked during a recent briefing about a comment from a Fox News host who said China should apologize for the disease, said the remark revealed ""total arrogance, prejudice and ignorance towards China.""

""There is simply no basis and no reason to push China for an apology. It is yet undetermined where the virus originated,"" he added.
Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida pushed back in an Op-Ed in the New York Post, writing that China is waging a deliberate misinformation campaign against the U.S.
""Beijing’s official outlets, for example, have accused the United States of over-hyping the pandemic for cynical purposes, with a foreign ministry spokeswoman declaring that Washington had 'taken the lead in imposing excessive restrictions.' American actions, she said, 'could only create and spread fear,'"" Rubio wrote.
""Other regime and regime-friendly outlets went further. The Chinese military portal Xilu.com recently published an article baselessly claiming that the virus is 'a biochemical weapon produced by the US to target China,'"" Rubio added.

Stupid floats to the top of coronavirus flood,"Once the deluge of water that brings on a flood stops, sludge floats to the top.
The floodwaters of the coronavirus are still rising in this country, but the sludge and corruption and outright stupidity that led to bad policy supported and enacted by our lawmakers is becoming apparent, even to the political neophyte.
Advertisement - story continues below
The Democrats, who want us to see them as champions of the poor and working class, held-up a much-needed relief bill that would prop-up the economy and save the jobs of countless millions, not to mention provide outright cash payments to individuals and families who need them most.
In return for their vote, Democrats tried to include a liberal wish-list that includes: reducing student loan debt, a permanent expansion of Obamacare, imposing diversity requirements on employers and tightening emission standards on airlines and cruise ships – two of the most hard-hit industries.
To justify their ""no"" vote they were calling the bill a ""corporate slush-fund."" This was no slush-fund. These were loans.  Corporations and businesses must pay back the loans once the crisis has passed.  This is the height of hypocrisy when you consider that it's the Democrats who want to bailout the airlines by giving outright grants to those who would put a union representative on their boards. Please!

But the politics surrounding this critical piece of legislation is just part of the sludge that recently has floated to the top.
Faced with this crisis, the Trump administration is considering a plan to use the powers at his disposal during a pandemic to close the border to all who enter illegally, including those so-called asylum seekers who simply refuse to wait in line for a chance at a better life. Trump's simple solution: Don't detain. Immediately deport them to their home country or turn them back into Mexico (or in some cases Canada), the country from which they came. 
Advertisement - story continues below
Funny, now that everyone is concerned about catching this dreaded coronavirus, you don't hear many bleeding-heart liberals complaining. They are too worried about saving their own skin.
But the Trump administration is not immune from stupid. While millions are now out of work, his administration has done nothing to put caps on the H1-B visa, the loophole that lets corporations bring in thousands of foreign workers who take our software and other STEM jobs. Instead, earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to speed up the process.
Many college graduates are available and desperately seeking these jobs. They worked hard and invested time and money on their education, but they are unable to pay off their college loans. Why? Companies are able to import these foreign workers through the H1-B visa program for a fraction of the cost by offering a green card and a chance to become an American citizen.
Speaking of foreign workers, have you called an American company's help line recently? If you have, no doubt you ended up talking to someone in India or the Philippines at the expense of an American worker who used to have that job. Why is it no one in Congress or the administration has addressed this issue?
These are the very jobs that thousands of disabled Americans would be happy to do. Instead we would rather have them sit idly by and pay them to do nothing.

Another stupid idea is the school lunch and breakfast program. This is one of the most wasteful programs in the country. Even in the midst of this crisis, we are working overtime to get meals to, not only poor children, but many middle-class and wealthy ones as well. Poor families get food stamps for the purpose of feeding their children. Are we to believe that welfare families are so helpless they can't provide their kids with a simple peanut butter and jelly sandwich with an apple or a bowl of cereal?
And stupid isn't limited to our government. Part of the sludge that has risen to the top is our individual inability to manage money.  More than 80 percent of workers are living paycheck to paycheck, and that includes many high-earners as well. Less than 40% can handle an unexpected $1,000 expense, much less enough sustain themselves for three to six months in a time of crisis or job loss.
Before we accuse the government of being ill-prepared for a crisis, we need to look in the mirror. Hopefully, we will all come out of this a lot smarter.

CNN is taking a step that even the World Health Organization has not taken regarding the coronavirus, announcing it will use the term ""pandemic"" to describe the outbreak.

Dr. Sanjay Gupta said Monday that ""while we know it sounds alarming, it should not cause panic.""
""Starting today, you will notice that CNN is using the term pandemic to describe the current coronavirus outbreak,"" Gupta wrote in a column for CNN.com, The Hill reported. ""It is not a decision we take lightly. While we know it sounds alarming, it should not cause panic.""
He acknowledge that the WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not called it a pandemic.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

""But many epidemiologists and public health experts argue the world is already experiencing a pandemic because of the novel coronavirus,"" he said.
""There are now over 100,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths attributed to this new virus. In one day last week, the number of new cases outside of China, where the virus originated, was nearly 9 times higher than the number of new cases in China. This virus has found a foothold on every continent except for Antarctica. In several countries, the number of cases continues to climb.""

World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a disease outbreak must be widespread on two continents to be termed a pandemic, The Hill reported.
In an interview with CNN on Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams urged the public not to panic.
""Initially, we had a posture of containment so that we could give people time to prepare for where we are right now,"" he said. ""We're shifting into a mitigation phase, which means that we're helping communities understand you're going to see more cases,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, you're going to see more deaths, but that doesn't mean that we should panic.""
Worldwide, more than 3,400 have died among more than 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases. In the U.S., more than 500 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., with 22 deaths, mostly in Washington state.
Gupta pointed out that humanity has overcome pandemics.

Coronavirus mapping site's predictions 'have fallen short',"
A major source of information upon which government leaders have relied to urge or order the canceling of public events, shut down of businesses and sheltering in place has proved to be inaccurate.
Advertisement - story continues below
The Federalist's Madeline Osburn points out many members of the media and state officials are relying on an online mapping tool called COVID Act Now.
The site, with a map of catastrophic forecasts for each state, boasts of enabling ""political leaders to quickly make decisions in their Coronavirus response informed by best available data and modeling.""
""But a closer look at how many of COVID Act Now's predictions have already fallen short, and how they became a ubiquitous resource across the country overnight, suggests something more sinister,"" Osburn wrote.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Osburn said the ""bogus data sets ... scare local and state officials into making rash, economy-killing mandates.""
The impact of the site cannot be ignored. The NBC affiliate in Dallas embedded the models in a story on a shelter-in-place order, and newspapers in Oregon published stories featuring the predictions about a ""point of no return.""
Advertisement - story continues below
It's been used by Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Georgia CBS report and others
But its predictions already have proven ""wildly wrong,"" Osburn said.
""COVID Act Now predicted that by March 19 the state of Tennessee could expect 190 hospitalizations of patients with confirmed Wuhan virus. By March 19, they only had 15 patients hospitalized,"" she pointed out.
""In New York, Covid Act Now claimed nearly 5,400 New Yorkers would’ve been hospitalized by March 19. The actual number of hospitalizations is around 750. The site also claimed nearly 13,000 New York hospitalizations by March 23. The actual number was around 2,500.""
There's more. The report noted COVID Act Now predicted 688 hospitalizations in Georgia by March 23. There were 800 cases in the state and only 300 hospitalizations.
Advertisement - story continues below
Numbers for other states were similar, the report said.
""Jordan Schachtel, a national security writer, said COVID Act Now’s modeling comes from one team based at Imperial College London that is not only highly scrutinized, but has a track record of bad predictions,"" Osburn said.
Jessica Hamzelou at New Scientist explained how Chen Shen at the New England Complex Systems Institute, a research group in Cambridge, Massachusetts, found flaws and ""incorrect assumptions"" in the formulas.
Even COVID Act Now has started acknowledging ""limitations,"" including that ""many"" original numbers ""are based on early estimates that are likely to be wrong"" and ""demographics, populations and hospital bed counts are outdated.""
Advertisement - story continues below
It's politics, though, that keeps the project in the headlines, the Federalist said.
""Founders of the site include Democratic Rep. Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins and three Silicon Valley tech workers and Democratic activists — Zachary Rosen, Max Henderson, and Igor Kofman — who are all also donors to various Democratic campaigns and political organizations since 2016. Henderson and Kofman donated to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016, while Rosen donated to the Democratic National Committee, recently resigned Democratic Rep. Katie Hill, and other Democratic candidates. Prior to building the COVID Act Now website, Kofman created an online game designed to raise $1 million for the eventual 2020 Democratic candidate and defeat President Trump. The game’s website is now defunct,"" Osburn said.
Perhaps, the analysis explained, ""the goal of COVID Act Now was never to provide accurate information, but to scare citizens and government officials into to implementing rash and draconian measures.""
""The creators even admit as much with the caveat that 'this model is designed to drive fast action, not predict the future.'""

Coronavirus 'likely stays infectious on surfaces for up to 9 days',"(STUDY FINDS) -- BOCHUM, Germany — As the number of patients infected with the novel coronavirus continue to rise out of Wuhan, China, as well as in the United States, the world is watching with bated breath as scientists from all over the globe work tirelessly to develop a vaccine. In the meantime, researchers are learning more about the deadly virus, and now they warn it may remain on surfaces for a significantly long period of time.
Novel coronavirus (2019-CoV) has quickly become a top story across media outlets all over the world, and unfortunately fear-mongering and unverified information has run rampant. Understandably, most people are primarily concerned with avoiding infection themselves, but just like everything else with this situation, verified reports of how exactly the virus is spread have been hard to come by.

A team of German researchers is offering up some important answers. Though their findings are not 100% verified, they are at the very least backed by legitimate scientific analysis performed by professionals. Paramount among their conclusions is that the virus can remain active and infectious on surfaces for up to nine days at room temperature.

Trump mocks Bloomberg over germy finger licking after mayor said he'd contain coronavirus,"Earlier this week, Democratic presidential candidate and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg had a clear, and expensive, message: He is more than qualified to handle an outbreak such as the coronavirus hysteria.
But many people began to question his qualifications once an odd -- and, honestly, disturbing -- video of him licking his fingers and handling communal pizza started making the rounds on Super Tuesday.

Even President Donald Trump took the opportunity to point out the conflicting message coming from the Bloomberg campaign.
On Sunday, Bloomberg released a campaign advertisement in which he asserted his ability to lead the country amid tragedy and outbreak based on his experience as a New York's mayor.
He cited his leadership as the city rebuilt from the 9/11 terrorist attacks as well as when it faced ""a hurricane, a blackout, attempted terror attacks, the West Nile virus and swine flu.”

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Bloomberg also suggested Trump isn't doing enough to reassure the American public and that he isn't ""taking all the necessary steps to protect the health and well-being of every citizen.""
""I know this has been a very worrisome week for many Americans. The coronavirus is spreading, and the economy is taking a hit. Markets have fallen because of uncertainty,"" he said.
Advertisement - story continues below
The three-minute ad was slated to air on both NBC and CBS during prime time and, according to The New York Times, cost the candidate anywhere between $1.25 million and $3 million.
Even though the commercial received backlash for the high cost, which isn't abnormal from the criticism Bloomberg has received thus far, another video that was shared on Snapchat on Super Tuesday presented a conflicting message from the campaign.
The video showed him not only tearing off crust from seemingly communal pizza, but then licking his fingers and touching other items on the table including a cardboard box of coffee. The caption read: ""When in doubt, rip the crust off.""
👇JUST WOW👇

The coronavirus originated in China and the country’s Communist government scrambled to keep the virus’s existence hidden from the rest of the world.
“It’s easy to scapegoat people, and that is what has always happened when there have been pandemics or epidemics: that foreigners are attacked, foreigners sometimes physically attacked,” Engel said on MSNBC Wednesday.

“If you look at what happened during the Middle Ages, there was lots and lots of scapegoating against an ethnic group or a religious group whenever there were pandemics that affected society and frightened a lot of people, and China certainly feels that that is what is happening now with people calling it the ‘Wuhan flu’ or the ‘Wuhan virus’ or the ‘China virus,'” Engel added.
“This is a virus that came from the territory of China but came from bats,” he continued. “This is a bat virus, not a China virus.”
“It doesn’t speak Chinese,” Engle said. “It doesn’t target Chinese people. It targets human beings who happen to touch their eyes, nose or mouth.”

President Donald Trump on Wednesday defended his decision to refer to the coronavirus as a “Chinese virus,” noting that Chinese propaganda has falsely tried to pin the blame on the U.S. instead.
“I have great love for all of the people from our country,” Trump said at a press briefing Wednesday. “As you know, China tried to say at one point — maybe they stopped now — that it was caused by American soldiers.”
“That can’t happen,” the president continued. “It’s not gonna happen. Not as long as I’m president. It comes from China.”

"Under siege from coronavirus, China targets poems","
The people of China are under siege from the coronavirus, with thousands of cases reported and the death toll rising, prompting quarantines and travel restrictions.

But the Chinese Communist Party still apparently has time to attack poetry.
Specifically, the target is the religious couplets families display to celebrate Chinese New Year.
Bitterwinter, an online magazine monitoring religious liberty and human rights in China, reports on the latest aggression against religion by the Chinese Communist Party.

""Throughout China, local governments were making sure that no religious couplets were sold or displayed in peoples' homes, threatening to fine or even imprison violators,"" the magazine said. 
The tradition is to write wishes, often on red paper, and hang them on the doors or gates of their homes. Spring Festival couplets are the most common and traditional form to celebrate the Chinese New Year, the magazine explained.

But the government in China has banned them.
""Religious couplets are forbidden, so are the couplets with the word 'love.' If you sell such couplets, not only will they be confiscated, but you will be fined,"" government officials warned shopkeepers in Luhe, a township in Henan's Shangqui city, according to the report.
One shopkeeper told the magazine: ""We don't carry religious couplets. Even if we had them, we wouldn't dare to sell them.""
There clearly was fear in the shopkeeper's comment. 
""If our customers get into trouble for posting them, they may reveal the source, and we'll be in trouble,"" he said, according to Bitter Winter. ""A few years ago, many shops sold religious couplets. In 2018, the government started banning them. Last year, all couplets were confiscated from shops, and this year, sellers are threatened to be fined and imprisoned.

The magazine reported local governments are encouraging religious believers to replace religious couplets with Communist Party propaganda and portraits of President Xi Jinping, which they distribute for free.
The magazine reported a believer from a village under the jurisdiction of Suiyang's Luhe township confirmed every household received couplets with CCP slogans from village officials, ""who demanded to post them instead of religious ones for the holidays.""
Among the new couplets?
""The party practices benevolent rule.""

Islamic clerics in Iran have backed off their claim that the coronavirus is a judgment of Allah, but ISIS is calling it a ""torment sent by Allah on whomsoever He wills"" in its latest newsletter.
ISIS also is advising jihadists to steer clear of Europe to avoid contracting the virus, reported the International Project on Terrorism, or IPT.
Nevertheless, the newsletter declared, ""Illnesses do not strike by themselves but by the command and decree of God.""

IPT noted the tenor of comments by Iranian clerics about the virus changed after the outbreak spread in the Islamic nation, causing the deaths of numerous senior Islamic clerics and high-ranking government officials.
Now, Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Major General Hossein Salami is suggesting the coronavirus is a biological weapon developed by the United States against China and Iran.

When the virus initially was reported in China, Salafist Islamic clerics in Egypt, Morocco and elsewhere dubbed it a ""Soldier of Allah"" targeting infidels.
Abdul Razzak al-Mahdi, a Syrian Salafist tweeted on Jan. 20: ""Allah gave them a soldier (virus). And many of God's soldiers said, Glory be to Him. ... O Allah, increase their suffering and affliction until they stop fighting your religion and worshipers.""
An Egyptian cleric said China ""launched a war against our Muslim Uyghur brothers and Allah sent his soldier [coronavirus].""
IPT reported the Algerian news outlet Al Masdar published a conspiracy theory under the headline ""A Zionist organization is behind the Coronavirus and the Zionist entity (Israel) claims to have found the vaccine.""
Iranian Mullah Nasser Makarem Shirazi declared Muslims must not take any Israeli medication for the virus unless there is no alternative.

"As Dems hammer Trump on coronavirus, De Blasio directly contradicts CDC advice","New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is a big-picture guy.
During his seven very long years running the Big Apple, the unpopular and often smug civic leader has managed to turn off a large portion of his electorate.
Advertisement - story continues below
Notoriously out of touch with details and people, he promised Democrats during his short, failed campaign for president that he’d solve the issues surrounding income inequality, immigration and gun control, without offering much in the way of further explanation.
It’s partially why he dropped out of the race last December, months before Democrats had cast a single primary vote.
As liberal Vox’s Emily Stewart wrote last July, de Blasio “can be perceived as caring more about big-picture symbolism than the day-to-day grind of city policy, and he’s not particularly charismatic.”

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

So, it’s no surprise de Blasio fumbled the ball on how to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, directly contradicting advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when speaking with a woman in New York City who had recently returned to the U.S. from Italy.
According to the New York Post, someone had the bright idea to put de Blasio on the answering end of the city’s 3-1-1 non-emergency phone line Wednesday.
Advertisement - story continues below
The results were disastrous.
De Blasio spoke with a concerned woman who had just returned from Italy -- where more than 1,000 people have now died after being infected with the coronavirus, according to Yahoo -- and indicated that she did not yet need to quarantine herself.
“No symptoms of any kind?” he asked the woman.
The mayor added, “If you experience any symptoms at any moment, at that time adjust your approach.”
“The important thing is to really be sensitive that if anything changes at all stay home immediately,” he said.
Advertisement - story continues below
You’d think that for all the complaining coming from Democrats about President Donald Trump’s response to the now-global pandemic, a high-profile Democrat such as de Blasio would at least brush up on the details of how to deal with potential exposure to the serious respiratory infection.
Of course, as the CDC states in regard to Americans returning from Italy, “Travelers returning from the specified countries in Europe must stay home for 14 days after returning from travel, monitor their health, and practice social distancing.”
Trump described criticism of his response to the virus from Democrats as a “hoax” and was practically dragged across concrete en route to being falsely accused of describing the entire pandemic as a hoax.
Now, we have a Democrat in command of the infrastructure of America’s most populous city advising a woman potentially infected with the coronavirus to go out and put others at risk.
Advertisement - story continues below
Perhaps de Blasio was too busy politicizing the virus with his fellow Democrats to acquaint himself with the minor details of the infection.
Thankfully, the Post reported that it contacted public officials about the mayor's potentially dangerous advice.
“The mayor misspoke,” Freddi Goldstein, a spokeswoman for de Blasio, said.
“If you return from Italy you should self-quarantine regardless of symptoms.""

New York officials intervened by contacting the concerned woman and offering her the correct information,"" she said.

3 important lessons from the CCP virus,"The CCP virus, commonly referred to as the novel coronavirus or Wuhan virus, has taught us many valuable lessons.
For one, it has laid bare our dangerous dependency on China for the essentials of life.  By now, most of us are familiar with the shocking statistics: 90+% of antibiotics and commonly used lifesaving medicines are made in China. We've seen how the bulk of protective medical gear is now made in China – and they won't export it. You'll find the same dangerous dependence in industry after industry, from automobiles to electronics.

President Trump sounded the alarm about our reliance on China long ago. His tariffs should have spurred companies to move back to America as he advised. Instead, too many executives chose profit and business-as-usual.  Sadly, we are all now paying the price for their greed and shortsightedness.
Second, we have seen the bureaucratic sclerosis afflicting our government. 
President Trump warned against the debilitating overregulation by a federal bureaucracy on autopilot. That, along with an antiquated tax code and deeply flawed trade deals, was choking the economy and pushing American industries overseas. 

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Anyone watching would notice that before we could attack the CCP virus we had to attack a thicket of regulations that hamstrung rapid response. 
When Seattle doctors reported the first U.S. cases of the CCP virus to the CDC, career bureaucrats ordered them to stop testing until they recertified their lab according to the regulations – a process that would take months. Admittedly, this is better than arresting the doctors, which is what happened in Red China, but it shows the same CYA reflex endemic to the bureaucratic mind.

It took the FDA two months into the pandemic before it suspended (not ended) regulations requiring a manufacturer wishing to make surgical masks to: 1) do a compositional side-by-side analysis of the mask versus all other masks currently sold, 2) measure ""tensile strength"" and ""impact resistance,"" 3) perform detailed ""risk analysis,"" for fluid/bacteria resistance and ""flammability,"" 4) fill out and return the ""standard ISO-10993"" form for ""Biological Evaluation of Medical Devices Part 1: Evaluation and Testing"" and so on.  Talk about barriers to entry.
Before this emergency, anyone who criticized the regulatory state was considered a crank and accused of hating babies. Now we know better.
Or at least some of us do.
Nearly half of all medical devices in the U.S., including the face masks and surgical gowns known as personal protective equipment, PPE, is sterilized using ethylene oxide, and there is no viable substitute available now to replace the chemical sterilizer.
Last year, environmental activists forced state and local officials in Illinois and Georgia to close sterilization facilities operated by Sterigenics.
Advertisement - story continues below
Sterigenics has at least 1 million items of personal protective equipment awaiting sterilization. 
Hospitals are desperate for this equipment, and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn asked the governor of Georgia for help:
""Due to the recent challenges with the closure of some commercial sterilizers, such as the Sterigenics facility located in Cobb County, the supply of critical PPE during the COVID-19 outbreak has been further limited. FDA is asking for your assistance in helping to increase the supply of PPE to help protect against COVID-19 by working with Sterigenics to allow for the appropriate sterilization of PPE,"" Hahn wrote.
In response, the environmentalists are accusing Sterigenics, and apparently the FDA, of trying to ""take advantage"" of the health crisis.
Advertisement - story continues below
Environmental leftists are not the only ones putting their own interests before the national interest.
The administration warned that anyone hoarding critical supplies would be dealt with harshly.
We typically picture the perp as a sweaty conniver with a garage full of Purell he sells for $150 a bottle on Amazon.
But hoarding takes other forms.
Advertisement - story continues below
Any manufacturer that claims ""existing supply chains"" should be protected above all else is also a hoarding profiteer. They are hoarding their know-how and their productive capacity to protect their own future profits at the expense of the nation's health. 
Ventilators provide a useful example. The existing supply chain to make ventilator parts is inadequate to meet the increased demand in this emergency. And many of the companies in that existing supply chain are located in Europe and Asia.
The ventilator manufacturers never had a contingency plan for a global pandemic.  That is understandable. But as result, there is no stockpile of components.  That in itself will backlog orders by weeks if manufacturers rely on their current suppliers.  Remember that when you hear ""We can only produce 7,500 ventilators a week.""
However, there are hundreds of other small and medium sized companies right here in the United States with the know-how and capacity eager to step up and fill the gap.  Many of these companies are completely shut down, some by orders of governors, and they could be making the plastic molded parts, tooling, die casting, precision machined parts now.
Advertisement - story continues below
The disruption due to the pandemic threatens to permanently shutter more of these companies – our domestic productive capacity. If that happens, even more manufacturing work will be transferred abroad in the future.
The big ventilator manufacturers are already sharing their blueprints with their parts suppliers in China. They need to share their blueprints with the American companies who are ready willing and able to make parts for the machines the nation needs now. Then the federal government could provide these companies with financing needed to surge production and start work immediately. 
This approach would address a number of problems the CCP virus has exposed. 
It would resolve immediate shortages of medical equipment. 
Advertisement - story continues below
It would put Americans back to work. 
And it would help reverse the offshoring of our manufacturing supply chains, the long-term problem that got us into the current mess and will be with us after the virus passes.

Famous soccer coach schools journalist on ridiculous coronavirus reporting,"Jurgen Klopp, famed manager of Liverpool FC, dismissed a question about the coronavirus outbreak this week and told a reporter that the opinions of celebrities are irrelevant.
Klopp was answering questions at a news conference Tuesday following his team’s FA Cup loss to Chelsea, according to CNN, when a reporter asked him a question about the virus.
Advertisement - story continues below
“Are you worried as a team, as a club, about the spread of [coronavirus] or how it might affect you?” the unidentified reporter asked.
The German was blunt, telling the reporter that not only does he consider his own opinion on the matter irrelevant, he believes celebrities are not qualified to answer questions relating to public health or politics, simply because they are famous.
“What I don’t like in life is that a very serious thing, a football manager’s opinion is important,” Klopp said. “I don’t understand it. I really don’t understand it.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

""I can ask you, you're in exactly the same role that I am.""

“It’s not important what famous people say,” he continued. “No, we have to speak about things in the right manner, not people with no knowledge, like me, talking about something.
“People with knowledge should talk about it and tell people to do this, do that, do this, and everything will be fine -- or not. Not football managers, I don’t understand that.""
Klopp concluded: “Politics, coronavirus, why me? I wear a base cap and have a bad shave.”


The question from the reporter comes at a time when many are concerned about the spread of the virus and apprehensive about attending public gatherings.
As of Thursday, more than 93,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported globally and more than 3,200 people have died from the disease, CBS News reported.
Advertisement - story continues below
Klopp took the correct approach to the reporter’s question. Why should the soccer manager answer him and risk creating more panic and uncertainty?
More importantly, why would a reporter ask such a foolish question?
A soccer coach is not a virologist anymore than a film star is an expert on foreign policy.
A great many celebrities seem to be under the impression that their achievements or wealth have made them omnipotent. It is refreshing to see a person in the spotlight defer an important question to the experts by essentially saying, “I don’t have the answers.”

If only Hollywood could grasp the concept that its constant ramblings about politics and the environment are irrelevant to a majority of people.
Comedian Ricky Gervais laid into Hollywood celebrities for their constant hectoring of everyday people during his opening monologue at the Golden Globe Awards in January.

Apparently, this kind of grim spiritual fatuousness isn't endemic to Christianity.
Iran-based Iraqi Shiite religious scholar Hadi al-Modarresi declared that coronavirus was Allah's punishment upon the Chinese for their mistreatment of Muslims.
Unfortunately, that punishment has also been visited upon him now that the virus has arrived in Iran -- which has, as of Thursday, the third-most infections and deaths.

""It is obvious that the spread of this virus is an act of Allah,"" al-Modarresi said, according to the translation.
""How do we know this? The spread of the coronavirus began in China, an ancient and vast country, the population of which makes up one-seventh of humanity. More than a billion people live in that country. The authorities in that country are tyrannical and they laid siege to more than a million Muslims and placed them under house arrest,"" he said.
""The journalists in that country began to mock the niqab of Muslim women and they forced Muslim men to eat pork and drink wine. Allah sent a disease upon them and this disease laid siege to 40 million [Chinese people],"" al-Modarresi continued. ""The same niqab that they mocked has been forced upon them, both men and women, by Allah, by means of the state authorities and officials.""
There's no doubt the Chinese government has mistreated the Uighur Muslims, whom it has packed into ""re-education"" camps because of their religion, but even with that these charges seem outlandish, and the connection between this and COVID-19 is tenuous -- if, of course, your definition of ""tenuous"" is ""nonexistent.""

But lo! Al-Modarresi has evidence, given how the virus was transmitted to humans.
""Islam forbade people from eating insects, but [the Chinese] mocked this matter,"" he said.
""And there you have it, this disease spread from the world of animals -- be it bats, ants, or snakes, the result is the same -- to the human world and it has scared humanity in its entirety.""
That video was uploaded on Feb. 25.

In early March, reports said the scholar himself had contracted the coronavirus.
A March 7 article from Iraq's Buratha News Agency said al-Modarresi's school announced his infection in a short statement, adding that he was resting in the hospital.
That same day, his official Twitter account said the same thing, appending a notice that he was doing better and recovering at the end of a prayer.
""اللّهم صلّ على محمد وآل محمد، واكشف عنّي بهم كل كرب، ونفّس عنّي بهم كل همّ، وفرّج عنّي بهم كل غمّ واكفني بهم كلّ خوف، واصرف عني بهم مقادير البلاء، وسوء القضاء، ودرك الشقاء، وشماتة الأعداء""

On March 10, meanwhile, he tweeted a picture of himself wearing what's quickly become the symbol of coronavirus, a surgical mask:

Wait, I thought this was all punishment for lifestyle. Did he take to eating insects and bats? Was the BLT just too good to resist?
At a wider level, this is the problem with taking a message out of coronavirus that doesn't exist.
It's not an argument for ""Medicare for all,"" it's not a sign of the failure of late-capitalist patriarchy and it certainly isn't a sign Allah is taking his wrath out on the Chinese. That's particularly true when you considered Allah apparently decided to take it out on his own next -- and not just any Muslims, but specifically those in mostly Shiite Iran.
In any sane world, a man like al-Modarresi would be standing on an upturned crate on a street corner hollering his nonsense about how disasters are punishment for people he doesn't like.

At least in the United States, such hucksters are consigned to the corners of the DirecTV channel lineup where few viewers tend to tread. Al-Modarresi has almost a million followers on Twitter.
At least, one hopes, they won't view him as an expert on divine virology anymore.

The coronavirus is absolutely dominating the headlines and our lives, and most of the stories aren’t exactly positive. If you’re looking for a silver lining in all this, a recent survey of 2,000 residents in the United Kingdom has identified a few unexpected benefits of the COVID-19 situation.
In this modern age, it’s become increasingly common for neighbors and community members to ignore each other and almost never speak. Well, 25% of respondents agree the coronavirus outbreak has led to conversations with neighbors (at a safe distance, of course) who they hardly knew at all before a few weeks ago. Additionally, 64% believe that COVID-19 has brought their community closer together in a variety of ways.

It’s well established at this point that the elderly and immunocompromised are particularly vulnerable to the virus. So, 30% of respondents have started checking in on their older relatives and 23% are doing the same for neighbors in need.

Whose fingerprints are on the coronavirus?,"As the coronavirus took global flight, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, made a startling revelation. He warned it is at least 10 times deadlier than the seasonal flu. But it is biological warfare (BW) expert professor Francis Boyle's interview that details what may well have led to coronavirus having such a powerful punch.
Boyle explains the concept of ""gain of function."" This is work that involves activating genetic mutations to more strongly enhance their impact. In layman's terms it is the equivalent of placing a virus on steroids. He details evidence as to how it may well have come into play to increase the lethality of the virus. As China and the U.S. play the blame game as to who is responsible for the pandemic, Boyle names names, explaining that several different sets of fingerprints were involved.
Advertisement - story continues below
The BW expert is clear at the outset there is little doubt the coronavirus now touring the globe came out of China's biowarfare lab in Wuhan. Regardless of what the Chinese government says in its efforts to cloud the issue to focus responsibility elsewhere and regardless of assertions by American liberals we are racist for calling it such, the release of coronavirus bears a ""made in China"" stamp. However, Boyle's investigation also reveals that others linked to various stages of development of the virus must share some responsibility as well.
Boyle tells us he has definitive evidence a biowarfare lab at the University of North Carolina (UNC) was the initial catalyst for the virus. He had criticized the lab earlier for its ""gain of function"" work. He condemns UNC for its DNA genetic engineering ""on every hideous biological warfare agent you can imagine, including MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), an agent which, again, is a bio-warfared coronavirus."" In the interview, Boyle read from a study underscoring what the UNC lab project had discovered: ""A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence.""
Shockingly, the study noted involvement in the project not only by UNC researchers and FDA representatives but also by ""Zhengli-Li Shi, Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens and Biosafety, Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, China."" Acknowledging the National Natural Science Foundation of China at the study's end made it clear the coronavirus technology was not stolen by China but Beijing had paid UNC to have one of its top BW experts involved in the project.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Boyle holds back no punches in his criticism. He states the university ""took dirty money from China"" to allow a top Chinese biowarfare expert ""to work with them to give gain of function biowarfare DNA genetic capability to SARS, which is dangerous enough to begin with. … It is clearly a smoking gun; clearly that laboratory must be shut down immediately and all those scientists investigated by the United States government for this and their responsibility here and for violating my Biological Weapons and Terrorism Act of 1989."" (Boyle helped draft this document, which today is international law.)
Boyle adds the virus was designed ""to infect human beings by their airways and then … in vivo. … So, they're using the gain of function technology"" to make sure it spreads quickly. ""Together the data confirmed the ability to infect human airway cells, etc. They know exactly what they are doing here. … It's weaponized coronavirus. They also conclude that they really couldn't find an antibody against it.""
Advertisement - story continues below
Boyle pointed to a footnote in the study stating, ""Cells were originally obtained from Fort Detrick,"" which means our own U.S. government biowarfare resources were involved. But while greed may have been the university's incentive for involvement in the project, what incentivized U.S. participation?
Boyle drops a bombshell at this point, revealing all the BW work was approved and funded by President Barack Obama's National Institutes of Health – the same agency now involved in attempting to stop the spread of the virus it helped wrought.
As it turns out, there also are Australian fingerprints involved. Boyle reported in 2010 that a science journal indicated Wuhan, with Aussie government approval, was working with an institution to genetically engineer DNA into a super bio-weapon involving SARS and HIV. The project met with success.
This may well be why China recently told the U.S. to ""correct its mistakes"" concerning the origin of the virus. A day after President Donald Trump described coronavirus as the ""Chinese Virus"" on Twitter, Beijing responded, ""We express strong indignation and objection to such stigmatization."" But obviously, China finds itself on the horns of a dilemma about detailing development of the virus. After all, despite some U.S. and Australian government participation, the Chinese were the ones ultimately putting it all together and, in the end, responsible for its accidental release.
Boyle concluded with the following:
Advertisement - story continues below
""The Wuhan scientists took the North Carolina SARS with gain of function, which is already a biological warfare weapon, and … took the technology here behind this well-developed SARS HIV weapon and … brought it back to the Wuhan … (lab trying) to DNA genetically engineer it into a chimera, into a biological warfare weapon involving the coronavirus, the HIV virus and gain of function. … The Chinese put all this together for themselves. And of course, they were planning to use it as biological warfare against us.""
When asked how the virus was released, Boyle believed it was by accident. Two Chinese scientists concluded the Wuhan lab was the release site, probably by someone unknowingly infected, due to the lengthy incubation period, who then spread it around before realizing he was sick.
If Boyle's assessment is accurate, there are a lot of questions needing answers. Did UNC's research, as Boyle suggests, violate international law? Was it simply greed motivating the university to undertake this project? And, even if intentions were purely scientific, how could academicians from a leading university and in Australia not recognize what China intended to do with the virus? Any rational Western researcher should have realized China was effectively being given a loaded BW gun to, eventually, point at us.
As we bear witness to the global havoc on a number of levels coronavirus is creating, it may be a blessing in disguise we are confronting it now rather than later as intended by China in some future confrontation.

"To protect U.S. from coronavirus, close the border!","The rapid spread of the coronavirus to the United States from an open-air meat market in China confirms again the deadliness of globalism. The international elite should acknowledge how difficult it is to contain and eradicate a virus in a world of open borders.
""Everyone is in a state of panic,"" Scott Liu said from a self-imposed quarantine at his home in Queens, New York. ""The coronavirus is the No. 1 threat to financial markets currently as global investors are becoming jittery on the uncertainty,"" the New York Times quoted investor Nigel Green as observing.

But while this deadly virus was quickly infecting people at the speed of air travel, globalists were enjoying wine and caviar at their annual confab in Davos, Switzerland. Politico.com even featured a recent article headlined ""Globalists Gone Wild,"" citing the energetic participation of Mitt Romney and George W. Bush in globalist celebrations.
The globalists were clueless about how fast a fatal, highly contagious virus can sweep across a world of open borders, free trade and unchecked migration. Far from the standards of Western civilization, an outdoor market in Wuhan, China, allowed numerous animals considered unclean by the Bible to become part of human consumption.
The deadly coronavirus thereby jumped from animals that are not eaten here, such as cats, bats and snakes. Without globalism, the virus could have been easily contained and eradicated by China, with its immense resources.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

On Tuesday China admitted that more than 100 people have already died from this virus, which has no known cure or treatment. The Communist Chinese dictators are not known for their transparency, so the death toll there could be much higher.
Thanks to globalism, the virus is sweeping across the world like a wildfire. People who have been exposed to coronavirus may already be in 22 states here, while Japan and Germany also have been afflicted.
Advertisement - story continues below
It is globalism that makes the unclean eating practices of distant Chinese a threat to the health and safety of Americans. This is not the first time an outbreak of a disease far away from our shores has caused panic and death within our borders, as the Ebola virus from Africa did in October 2014.
This latest tragedy is ironic in its timing. It comes just as a new trade deal with China was reached amid much fanfare, without anyone pointing out that expanding global trade means bringing deadly viruses from other countries to the United States.
An article just published in The Lancet, a prestigious British medical journal, describes a shocking 15% fatality rate among those who contract this coronavirus. Others estimate the infection rate to be as high as 83%, and people may be contagious before they show any symptoms.
These rates suggest that if one person has coronavirus on an airplane carrying 150 people, then 18 other passengers could contract the disease and die from it. This is hardly comforting information and could deliver a mortal blow not only to people, but to our economy too.
The potential for harm from biological agents has long been considered higher than all other types of threats to human safety. A strain of the flu killed more people at the end of World War I than armed warfare did.
Advertisement - story continues below
Perhaps coincidentally, Wuhan is also the site of a top secret biological weapons development lab. One can only wonder if something so deadly might have come from the warfare lab itself.
Closing our borders and ending our permissive visa policy, which brings so many foreigners into our country, is the only effective way to protect our citizens against this invasion of a deadly virus. Quarantines within the United States are only effective if the disease does not continue to enter from other countries.
Already experts are saying that it is too late to contain the virus within China, so the only meaningful approach is to keep the virus out of the United States. This requires tightening our border security and visa policy.
""Despite the enormous and admirable efforts in China and around the world, we need to plan for the possibility containment of this epidemic isn't possible,"" declared infectious disease expert Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London. He estimated that as many as 100,000 people may already be infected in China.
Advertisement - story continues below
Most of the cases in the United States until now have been on the West Coast, and in Arizona. But once inside our borders, there is little to stop it from spreading immediately to others through airports, train stations, and commuter lines.
It is infeasible to provide a medical exam to every person who wants to travel to the United States. Instead, what should be done is to limit the vast amount of migration here, particularly from regions that do not share Western standards of cleanliness.

Controlled testing still is needed to assess the validity of the treatment.
""That first wave of Chinese patients we had (in Australia), they all did very, very well when they were treated with the HIV drug,"" Paterson told DailyMail.com.

The HIV drugs are commonly used today while chloroquine is not.
Chloroquine once was a common treatment for malaria, but as people have developed an increased natural resistance to the mosquito-borne disease, the drug has been used less frequently.

Watch China expert's theory of 'repulsive' way coronavirus got loose,"
The coronavirus is a top news headline, with tens of thousands of cases worldwide and more than 2,000 fatalities.
Advertisement - story continues below
It also has triggered a large slide in stock markets, with investors worried about its impact on the supply chain, transportation and consumers.
But now a China expert has revealed how he believes the threat began: through people eating animals that were used as test subjects at a lab that allegedly developed the virus.
The expert is Steven Mosher, a social scientist, anti-abortion activist and author who specializes in anthropology, demography and the Chinese government's tactics to contain its population.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

President of the Population Research Institute, he's been been a top critic China's one-child -- and now two-child -- policy, which is enforced by mandatory abortion.
He's also a founding member of the Committee on the Present Danger: China.
Advertisement - story continues below
His comments are at this link.
He appeared on Tucker Carlson's Fox News program to explain his theory. Carlson previously warned of the danger of the coronavirus:

In  a commentary for the New York Post, Mosher pointed out that President Xi Jinping announced a desire for a biosecurity control system ""to protect the people's health.""
""Xi didn't actually admit that the coronavirus now devastating large swaths of China had escaped from one of the country's bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive titled: 'Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.'""
Advertisement - story continues below
He continued: ""Read that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn’t it? And just how many 'microbiology labs' are there in China that handle 'advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus'?""
Mosher said it turns out there's only the one, a Level 4 lab called the National Biosafety Lab near Wuhan's Institute of Virology. Wuhan is known to be ground zero for the outbreak.
""What’s more, the People’s Liberation Army’s top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak,"" he explained. ""According to the PLA Daily, Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.""
That suggests, he said, that the coronavirus may have escaped from the lab, and China is trying to put it back.
Advertisement - story continues below
But how did this happen?
""There is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them,"" he explained.
""You heard me right. Instead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash. Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash. One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound up in someone's stomach,"" Mosher said.
Look at the excuses, he said, that already have been used: ""They first blamed a seafood market not far from the Institute of Virology, even though the first documented cases of Covid-19 (the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2) involved people who had never set foot there. Then they pointed to snakes, bats and even a cute little scaly anteater called a pangolin as the source of the virus.
Advertisement - story continues below

Swiss shift coronavirus strategy to protecting most vulnerable,"(REUTERS) The Swiss government on Friday shifted its focus in the fight against the new coronavirus to protecting those most vulnerable, while continuing to try to slow its spread and track the origins of individual cases as long as possible.

“The focus is on protecting the health of particularly vulnerable people,” the government said in a statement. “The aim is to prevent serious illnesses and deaths as well as avoiding overloading health facilities.”

Coronavirus patient: I was on the brink of death and malaria drug 'saved my life',"A Florida man who contracted the coronavirus is crediting his survival with the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine.
Rio Giardinieri told KTTV-TV that doctors gave the drug to him Friday while he was in critical condition diagnosed with coronavirus and pneumonia at Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood, Florida.

Giardinieri, who is 52, recalled falling so ill that he said goodbye to his family, as doctors put him on oxygen and told him there was nothing more they could do for him as he battled the virus.
“I was at the point where I was barely able to speak and breathing was very challenging. I really thought my end was there. I had been through nine days of solid pain and for me, the end was there. So I made some calls to say in my own way goodbye to my friends and family,” he said.
As a last resort, Giardinieri said, he contacted an infectious disease doctor after a friend sent him an article detailing how anti-malaria drugs such as hydroxychloroquine had worked for COVID-19 patients overseas.

Giardinieri said doctors cautioned him against using untested drugs such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, but he had little to lose as he felt he was near death.
Doctors administered several doses of hydroxychloroquine, which at first seemed to react badly with Giardinieri, KTTV reported.

“After being given the drug, I couldn’t breathe and my heart was pounding again so they gave me some Benadryl through the system and something else,” Giardinieri said.
“It allowed me to go to sleep and when I woke up at exactly 4:45 in the morning, I woke up like nothing ever happened,"" he said.
Giardinieri told KTTV that doctors later believed the extreme symptoms were not the drug but rather the virus moving through his body.
“To me, there was no doubt in mind that I wouldn’t make it until morning,” he said. “So to me, the drug saved my life.”
Giardinieri is now able to sit up and speak, and hopes to return to his home by the end of the week.

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are among nearly 70 drugs being investigating as possible treatments for coronavirus, The New York Times reported.
President Donald Trump said at Thursday's White House news briefing that chloroquine could potentially be a “game-changer” if it is proven to be successful during COVID-19 trials.
“This is beyond right-to-try,” Trump said. “If treatments known to be safe in Europe, Japan or other nations are known to be effective against a virus, we’ll use that information to protect the health and safety of American people.”

“Nothing will stand in our way as we pursue any avenue to find what best works against this horrible virus,” he added.
Despite reported cases of success in using drugs such as chloroquine to combat COVID-19, Trump has been criticized for being optimistic about their potential.
NBC News reporter Peter Alexander went as far as to accuse Trump of giving “false hope” to the country during the Thursday briefing.
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who announced his state will begin trials on the drug Tuesday, has not faced the same criticism.

Forbes reported New York, which is a hotspot for U.S. cases of coronavirus, has acquired 750,000 doses of chloroquine, 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine and 10,000 doses of the antibiotic Zithromax.
""The president is optimistic about these drugs, and we are all optimistic that it could work,” Cuomo said of the upcoming drug trials.

Dr. Ben Carson turns tables on Dems attacking Pence's coronavirus response,"Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson defended the coronavirus task force’s handling of the virus from partisan political attacks this week at a news conference.
Carson, who recently joined the task force, defended its efforts to contain the spread of the potentially deadly infectious disease.

“I want to thank the vice president and the president for a very aggressive and careful leadership,” he said Wednesday.
Carson, who was a renowned neurosurgeon before beginning his career in politics and public service, added: “I was involved throughout my neurosurgical career in a lot of very, very complex cases and dealt with a lot of renowned physicians.
“But I must say that the people on this task force are extremely impressive, have been considering all of the various different possibilities, outlining scenarios for all the possibilities that can occur.""

Carson added he believes the risks associated with contracting the disease are low, “largely because of the aggressive actions that have been taken and are continuing to be taken every day.”

The HUD secretary also praised pharmaceutical companies for working together “voluntarily” in order to help to find a way to manage potential outbreaks.
“Wouldn’t that be a great lesson for the politicians?” he joked.
Carson’s comments came in response to partisan criticism of President Donald Trump’s handling of his administration’s preparedness of a possible outbreak of the virus.
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus in China was reported, Trump has not only acted decisively to help to contain its spread away from the U.S., but also quickly formed a task force in order to deal with the issue.
The president immediately imposed travel restrictions to China in January, just as the virus was starting to grab international headlines. The move was criticized by Democratic lawmakers and members of the establishment media for allegedly helping to sow seeds of racism.
Advertisement - story continues below
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden also claimed the travel restrictions were race-related, The Hill reported.
“This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia — hysterical xenophobia — and fearmongering,” the former vice president said.
Of course, when you’re a far-left Democrat, everything is racist.
In similar fashion, CNN argued that the travel ban could lead to “stigmatizing countries and ethnicities.”

Trump also came under attack for appointing Vice President Mike Pence to head the task force, which itself was criticized for not being adequately racially diverse.

CNN published an article by Michael D'Antonio criticizing Pence as “anti-science.”
“President Donald Trump is again playing the denial game and, unhelpfully, has tapped Vice President Mike Pence -- a man who has repeatedly demonstrated his anti-science predilection -- to lead the government response,” the article read.
Advertisement - story continues below
The CNN hit piece also mocked the vice president for praying and blamed him for an outbreak of HIV/AIDS during his time as governor in Indiana.
Members of the establishment media have also falsely claimed that Trump described the coronavirus as a ""hoax.""
While people are concerned about the spread of a potentially deadly virus, Democrats have played politics with the federal government’s readiness every step of the way.
That is why it is so crucial to have a figure such as Carson join the government's official response. He might be a former presidential candidate and a surrogate for Trump, but his area of expertise is in medicine.

The doctor is probably more qualified to speak about the virus than anyone in CNN’s newsroom.
Carson spoke at length to Fox Business host Charles Payne on Tuesday about the task force’s response to the coronavirus and expounded on the criticism from Democrats and the establishment media.
“I suspect if Jesus Christ was on the committee, they would have a complaint about that,” he said.
Carson also promised the task force is staying ahead of the curve to respond to any changes with the disease.

Would the 'Squad' use an Israel-developed coronavirus vaccine?,"Will anti-Semites, like those in the ""Squad,"" reject a COVID-19 vaccine if it is developed by Israel?
Regarding the coronavirus, as things improve in China, things will likely worsen in America. However, they are not likely to get as bad as it is in others countries, like Italy.
Advertisement - story continues below
But we have to be careful about comparisons. The effects of this virus are apparently amplified in the elderly and those with pre-existing health issues.
What isn't widely publicized is that Italy's median age is much higher than other European nations, thus it is being hit much harder than nations with younger overall populations.
That being said, the reason why things are improving in China while worsening in the U.S. and elsewhere is the timeline.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

COVID-19 began in China and developed almost two months earlier than anywhere else. It is known that most if not all of these types of illnesses (viruses) follow a pattern, or bell curve, otherwise known as Farr's law.
In 1840, Dr. William Farr discovered that epidemics follow a pattern and can be tracked via a bell curve.
Advertisement - story continues below
Bell curve
Following the bell curve, epidemics ""exhibit a sharp increase in cases at the beginning of the cycle, a peak, and then a decline in cases and a return to baseline.""
The peak is reached as people ""modify their behavior to avoid getting sick, and those who do get sick seek medical attention.""
China is now, at least it appears, on the descending side of the curve. Chinese authorities have begun reporting a steep decline in confirmed cases.
Unfortunately, the United States is about 50 days behind China. This means we are still on the ascending side of the curve and should fully expect a drastic increase in confirmed cases.
Advertisement - story continues below
So here's an interesting paradox.
At this point, America and the world are breathlessly waiting the development and production of a coronavirus vaccine. And the conventional wisdom is that one of two countries is likely to develop it.
These two countries are the U.S. and Israel – also known as the Great Satan and Little-Satan.
We all know how leftists, in virtual lock step, are virulently anti-Israel. If they had their way, every company in America, every interest, such as college and university endowments, would divest of everything Israel.
Advertisement - story continues below
And if the women of the Squad had their way, particularly, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, the United States government would abandon Israel tomorrow. Both are staunch supporters of the Boycott, Divest, Sanction (BDS) movement against Israel.
So, I'll ask again.
With their obvious hatred of everything Israel, will the women of the Squad reject a vaccine if it is developed by Israel? And by the way, it is looking pretty promising that Israel is on track to do just that.
Will they demand that the United States ""boycott"" the use of the vaccine and encourage their supporters to do the same? Will their anti-Semitic buddy and Shariah-lover Linda Sarsour follow suit and insist that no Muslim take the vaccine?

This all sounds silly, considering the severity of the coronavirus, but it's not. If these women, who have publicly espoused their contempt for the Jewish nation, are to be consistent, shouldn't this be the path they follow?

Dem congressman threatens Trump Jr. with 'serious altercation' over coronavirus comments,"Democratic Rep. John Garamendi of California issued a strong threat to President Donald Trump's eldest son in a live television appearance Friday morning on MSNBC.
Not pleased with recent remarks from Donald Trump Jr. regarding alleged attempts by American leftists to weaponize the global spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) against the Trump administration, Garamendi suggested the president's son should take a wide berth of him in the future to avoid ""a serious altercation.""

""That is totally outrageous. I can assure you that there is not a Democrat or Republican in Congress that wants anybody to be sick,” the 75-year-old Democrat added. “What we are concerned about is the administration's response to this illness. We've known since December that there was an epidemic in China.""
""Don Jr. had better not get anyplace close to me. It would not be a healthy situation,"" he later reiterated.

Following suit with a number of prominent Democratic opponents to the president, Garamendi went on to accuse the Trump administration of failing to respond quickly enough to the early stages of the global outbreak, which cropped up last month in Wuhan, China.
Transmissible through human-to-human contact, the new strain of SARS-like coronavirus was believed Thursday to have spread to more than 82,000 people globally and killed roughly 2,700, according to CNN.
Weekend panic over more than 1,000 new case reports in South Korea, Italy and even Iran was, however, said to have impacted global market trends in a dramatic and negative fashion -- an economic downturn exacerbated Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's early public warning COVID-19 would almost certainly see wider stateside spread in the coming months.
The president has downplayed such sentiments, according to Politico, requesting Monday that Congress allocate roughly $1.25 billion in untouched capital as emergency funding for executive disease response efforts, which lean on heavy travel restrictions and screening procedures instituted by the administration at the start of the outbreak while American scientists scramble for a vaccine
According to Democrats like Garamendi, whose 3rd Congressional District reportedly has seen the first stateside cases of untraceable community spread, the response has been underwhelming.
""We've known since December that there was an epidemic in China,"" Garamendi claimed. ""We've known since that time that there were Americans that were exposed to this in Wuhan and other parts of China. We know that there was a Princess cruise ship with high exposure and cases in Japan.""

""Those people were brought back to the United States, frankly, with very little planning, and very little preparation, and no testing available,"" the congressman said.

As of yet, however, the U.S. has recorded just 60 cases of non-fatal coronavirus, according to The Washington Post -- leading right-wing personalities such as the president's son to believe the threat to the U.S. is largely media and political hype, meant to damage the Trump economy.

""There’s no question that the threat of coronavirus can destabilize the market,"" Trump Jr. told Fox News' ""Fox & Friends"" at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday. ""But the fact that the Democrats are seemingly hoping for this to happen -- just like you’ve seen them over the last year pray for a disaster to happen in the economy, meaning people lose their jobs, their mortgages, their livelihoods -- so that they can own Trump somehow, is absolutely insane.""
""We've seen this play out for four years. Anything that they can use to try to hurt Trump, they will,"" he said. ""The playbook is old at this point, but for them to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump’s streak of winning is a new level of sickness.""
""I don't know if this is coronavirus or Trump Derangement Syndrome, but these people are infected badly,"" the president's son continued.

The decision has the backing of Georgia Democrats.

""Georgians who have already cast their vote in person or by mail for the March 24 primary will be able to vote again in the May 19 primary for the elections already scheduled for that date. If Georgians who have already cast their vote for the March 24 primary do not vote again in the May 19 primary, their votes for the presidential preference primary will still count.""
Cobb County elections director Janine Eveler said she backed the decision, according to The Associated Press.
“Each day we had more and more poll workers wanting to bow out due to concern over their health,” Eveler said, adding that in recent days she had lost more than 100 poll workers because of health concerns.
Until the announcement, Georgia had been focused on trying to minimize the risks of elections.
“Last week, the state began the process of purchasing 9,000 bottles of spray Purell that will be distributed to counties for their use at polling locations,” Ari Schaffer, the press secretary for Raffensperger, said, according to The New York Times. “We also have purchased thousands of lint-free wipes for use to sanitize the screens and equipment.”

The only other state to adjust voting rules has been Wyoming, which has dropped in-person voting for its April 4 caucuses.
Alaska, which also votes on April 4, is urging voters to cast their ballots by mail but has not made a ruling on in-person voting.
Connecticut, which has its primary scheduled for April 28, is loosening the rules on absentee ballots to allow people who fear the coronavirus to be able to vote from home.
“Through surprise October snowstorms, November hurricanes, to the threat of a global pandemic -- voting in Connecticut must go on,” Secretary of the State Denise Merrill said in a statement on her office's website.

“The nature of COVID-19, or the coronavirus, is such that public health experts advise minimizing crowds and direct contact with other people.

Top Chinese coronavirus expert 'very worried' about another 'large-scale epidemic' in China,"Chinese health officials are concerned that the global COVID-19 pandemic might boomerang back and hit China again for a second wave of mass infections.

The outlet interpreted Lanjuan’s comments from China's state-run media, which reported health officials in China are now concerned that international travelers could ignite a second outbreak in the country.
“This requires us to continue to intensify our efforts and work tirelessly to prevent the coronavirus pneumonia epidemic from spreading in other cities,” the 73-year-old doctor said.
The doctor reportedly has spent the last 50 days helping to lead the campaign to rid Wuhan, the original epicenter of the outbreak, of the virus.

“[I am] very worried that imported cases could trigger another large-scale epidemic in our country,” she said.
“The mission in Wuhan has not been accomplished, and there are still many critical patients. Furthermore, I think the current situation in our country is very tough,” she told China’s state-run People's Daily.

The Daily Mail reported China is prepared to take measures against travel after a person in Guangdong province became ill after coming into contact with someone who had recently returned from Turkey.
The international traveler, who is a Chinese citizen, was diagnosed with COVID-19, as was the person with whom she had contact.
Officials in Guangdong, in southeastern China, said the diagnosis was the first known case of a person spreading the virus in the country after being infected from outside of China.
The traveler, a 34-year-old woman described as Ms. Lin, returned to Guangdong on March 9 and did not show any symptoms of the virus.
She tested positive on March 21.

The woman had been in contact with a 54-year-old man who has also tested positive.
“Can we make every effort to guard our country and prevent another epidemic from happening? This is a tough challenge,” Lanjuan told state media.

“Cases related to imported cases are the second-generation cases brought in from abroad. It means the close contacts of [the imported cases] have been transmitted and fallen ill,” the newspaper reported, according to the Daily Mail.

He's clearly not a fan of the Trump administration -- a retweet of a Rachel Maddow clip in which MSNBC talked about how ""in the middle of a severe public health emergency, the president just lies about it over and over and over again"" is a pretty good indication of that -- but this is about par for the course these days:
This is a serious virus and the consequences of ignoring it are grave - the US already lost time doing that - but there is also a big price for overreacting. Virologists I’ve spoken to say we need to learn ""to live with the virus,"" guard against it, and keep moving ahead.

There are people getting angry on these Twitter threads because, well, they're Twitter threads and of course they end up getting angry. However, on Thursday, Engel managed to earn that anger -- even though he was right.
""The reaction/overreaction in the US to the virus seems largely political,"" Engel wrote.
""Trump’s critics have no confidence in him, so they panic. Others defend Trump no matter what he does and don’t listen to anyone else. Not a recipe for keep calm and carry on. When broken you can’t be strong.""

Amazing -- I didn't know that NBC was a ""mainstream media"" hive that was in the business of ""com[ing] up with the most absurd and demeaning false equivalencies to keep [its] corporate bosses happy and the advertising dollars rolling in.""
Note how Engel pointed out that both sides were being partisan over a disease at a time when we need to come together (while maintaining social distancing, of course). The reason I've posted responses solely from the left isn't just because they have blue checkmarks nor is it because I want to deliberately set out to create a sense of imbalance, given I'm a conservative writer. I searched for an angry pro-Trump response for as long as I could stand to read another Twitter thread full of invective over coronavirus.
Advertisement - story continues below
Engel criticized both sides for their politicized reaction to COVID-19. One side got furious. Especially given the number of people with minor-league verified accounts that ended up sharing their lividity, that says something.
As previously stated, though, Engel is right.
If there's a reaction or overreaction from the left, it comes from the fact that they believe they have no confidence in the leadership at the top. Notice, for instance, the invective heaped on Trump's two speeches last week -- including the kerfuffle over his use of the words ""foreign virus"" to describe coronavirus, which was decried by the press as xenophobic.
One of the people who implied there was xenophobia there was Joe Biden, who made the accusation in a speech on the virus last week that was widely praised as being presidential material by everyone who tilts toward Biden. One issue, of course, was the fact that Biden's coronavirus plan was, on an almost issue-by-issue basis, the same as Trump's.
Advertisement - story continues below
On the other hand, let's not pretend that Trump has been perfect in dealing with the pandemic. He hasn't been, and blindly trusting him just because you're a Trump voter isn't terribly helpful.
For instance, the president's speech last Wednesday, while certainly not the flaming pile of disaster the media said it was, contained several glaring errors, including the unnerving moment when he said that ""trade and cargo"" from Europe would be barred as well as travelers. It wasn't, and his inability to explain the entirety of the European ban clearly left the White House to clarify many of the points.
However, while Engel is right in diagnosing the symptoms of the divide, he doesn't necessarily get the disease correct. Note that this is a guy who's working on the purportedly objective side of NBC News. Note, too, his retweet of Rachel Maddow mentioned above. Engel doesn't see any particular dissonance between these two facts.
Advertisement - story continues below
The American media has done everything possible to divide us because, let's face it, it makes for a good show. These aren't supposed to be opinion journalists -- and yet here they are, wondering why we're so polarized in one tweet and in another, cosigning Maddow, whose conspiracy theories about the Trump administration have been wild-eyed enough that they could pass for Alex Jones-type stuff were she on the right.
I'm not going to slaughter Engel over that, however. The opinion journalists and academics of the left's echo chamber did quite a fine job of that on their own.

U.S. government takes first enforcement action against coronavirus fraud,"
A federal court in Texas has taken the first enforcement action against alleged fraud stemming from the Chinese coronavirus epidemic, ordering a website that offered ""access to World Health Organization vaccine kits"" to be shut down.
Advertisement - story continues below
""In fact, there are currently no legitimate COVID-19 vaccines and the WHO is not distributing any such vaccine,"" the Department of Justice said.
U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman issued a temporary restraining order requiring that access to the website coronavirusmedicalkit.com be blocked.
""The Department of Justice will not tolerate criminal exploitation of this national emergency for personal gain,"" said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the DOJ's Civil Division. ""We will use every resource at the government's disposal to act quickly to shut down these most despicable of scammers, whether they are defrauding consumers, committing identity theft, or delivering malware.""

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

The case was filed in Austin against the website operators, following orders from Attorney General William Barr for the department to prioritize the detection, investigation and prosecution of illegal conduct related to the pandemic.
According to the DOJ, the site operators were ""engaging in a wire fraud scheme seeking to profit from the confusion and widespread fear surrounding COVID-19.""
Advertisement - story continues below
They claimed to offer consumers access to World Health Organization vaccine kits in exchange for a shipping charge of $4.95, which consumers would pay by entering their credit card information on the website.
""We hope in the future that responsible web domain registrars will quickly and effectively shut down websites designed to facilitate these scams,"" said U.S. Attorney John F. Bash of the Western District of Texas. ""My office will continue to be aggressive in targeting these sorts of despicable frauds for the duration of this emergency.""
""At a time when we face such unprecedented challenges with the COVID-19 crisis, Americans are understandably desperate to find solutions to keep their families safe and healthy,"" said Christopher Combs of the FBI's San Antonio Field Office. ""Fraudsters who seek to profit from their fear and uncertainty, by selling bogus vaccines or cures, not only steal limited resources from our communities, they pose an even greater danger by spreading misinformation and creating confusion.""
The order is based on a federal law that allows courts to issue injunctions to prevent harm to potential victims of fraudulent schemes.
The DOJ advised consumers to protect themselves by researching companies that advertise COVID-19 solutions. Consumers also are urged to be aware of modified web addresses such as ""cdc.com"" instead of ""cdc.gov""; to distrust unsolicited emails offering treatment or products; and to ignore offers for a COVID-19 vaccine, cure or treatment, and charities requesting donations by wire transfer or gift card,.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is using public fears about the coronavirus as a fundraising tool for his 2020 presidential campaign.
Sanders sent out a campaign email to supporters Monday asking them to sign a petition demanding the government guarantee that a potential coronavirus vaccine will be free of charge. The petition asks supporters for “contributions to fight back against drug companies who want to profit off of health care.”

“I am not very confident in the president’s ability to manage this crisis,” he wrote in the email.
“Health experts agree that the spread of the coronavirus will likely get worse before it gets better,” Sanders added.

“Donald Trump must stop spreading lies and fear, and leave the science to scientists and health professionals, not politicians.”
The petition linked in the email includes three questions, counting the donation pitch.
The other two questions ask respondents if they “believe that vaccines, tests, treatment, and quarantines related to the coronavirus should be FREE?” and if they “know that drug companies are spending BIG money in order to defeat our movement?”
Sanders’s campaign didn’t immediately return a request for comment on the email.
Sanders is trailing frontrunner former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary.

Coronavirus-positive woman faces up to 7 years in prison for allegedly hiding symptoms to board flight,"A woman is being investigated by Chinese authorities and is facing time behind bars after she allegedly concealed symptoms of the coronavirus and boarded an airplane from California to China last week.
The Los Angeles Times reported a 37-year old Chinese citizen and Massachusetts resident tested positive for the virus in Beijing after traveling to the country on a flight from Los Angeles.

According to Chinese authorities, the woman, identified only as Li, took fever-reducing medication in an attempt to conceal her symptoms in order to get to China.
Li had attended a conference in Boston that has been linked to a February conference in the same city held by the Cambridge-based biotechnology company Biogen.
WCVB reported more than 100 cases of coronavirus in the United States have been linked to the conference.

Cases of coronavirus potentially linked to the Biogen conference have been reported in Tennessee, North Carolina, Indiana, New Jersey, Washington, D.C., and even Europe.
The company told FiercePharma it believes “Ms. Li is a U.S.-based Biogen employee who made a personal decision to travel to China,"" where the Chinese government is handing out harsh punishments to anyone suspected of endangering public health.

Li is being investigated by authorities in China for the crime of “impeding prevention of infectious diseases,” and she could face up to three years in prison with a possibility of forced labor, the Times reported.
The newspaper added that her punishment could also become more severe ""if there are 'serious consequences,'"" the newspaper said.
In that case, she could face up to seven years in prison.
Li is currently hospitalized in China with the virus, the Times reported.
“Those who try to test their luck and evade customs and quarantine not only will bear the whole society’s shaming and condemnation, but will also face the scourge of imprisonment,” Chinese customs official Wang Jun said.

The Times added that ""at least 25 other people in China have been punished or investigated for concealing their coronavirus symptoms or travel history.""
While China has been accused of underreporting the number of cases and fatalities related to the coronavirus, the number of confirmed cases reported in the country does appear to have gone down.
China on Thursday reported only 34 new cases of the virus and eight deaths.
Up to this point, China has officially identified more than 81,000 cases of the virus and reported 3,245 deaths since the outbreak of COVID-19 began in December in Wuhan, the capital city of China’s Hubei province.

Germany, meanwhile, has reported a lower mortality rate in its reported coronavirus cases than its neighbors on the continent.

Trump made the announcement during a rare Oval Office address to the nation that he is suspending all travel from Europe to the U.S. for 30 days beginning at 11:59 p.m. Friday. After days of playing down the threat, he blamed Europe for not acting quickly enough to address the novel coronavirus and claimed that U.S. clusters were “seeded” by European travelers.

The heightened urgency is due to the fact that new reports coming out of China indicate the virus, which has killed at least four people and sickened more than 200, can be passed from person to person.
Advertisement - story continues below
On Friday, when the Centers for Disease Control announced screenings at three U.S. airports to stop the virus from entering the U.S., it had killed two people and sickened more than 40.
It wasn't clear then if the virus could spread from humans to other humans. The initial virus was spread by people who visited a now-closed seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan, China.
And health care workers who treated infected individuals in China did not become infected themselves, the CDC noted at the time.
“Now we can say it is certain that it is a human-to-human transmission phenomenon,” Dr. Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese scientist leading the government's response to the outbreak, said Monday on Chinese state-run TV, according to The New York Times.
One expert said a pro-active response in necessary.
Advertisement - story continues below
“There are now sufficient cases that it’s not going to die out by chance,” Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College in London, told The Times. “The real question now is, how efficiently can this virus spread from person to person?”
Zhong said that in the first confirmed cases of person-to-person transmission, two people in Guangdong Province in southern China were infected by family members who had traveled to Wuhan.
Contrary to initial reports that no medical workers were infected, one patient appeared to have infected 14 health care workers, he said.
Zhong, one of the scientists who helped identify the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus in 2003, said the disease was ""climbing"" and that the ""death rate at the moment is not so representative,"" according to CNN. In 2002 and 2003, SARS infected more than 8,000 people worldwide and killed 774.

On Friday, the CDC said travelers from Wuhan, China, would be screened at the three airports where the highest number of travelers from Wuhan arrive from -- San Francisco International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport and New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport.
The CDC's website says ""the immediate health risk from 2019-nCoV to the general American public is deemed to be low at this time. Nevertheless, CDC is taking proactive preparedness precautions.""
Chinese President Xi Jinping said his government is making its response to the virus a priority, according to NBC News, which cited Chinese state-run TV.
""The recent outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan and other places must be taken seriously,"" Xi said. ""Party committees, governments and relevant departments at all levels should put people's lives and health first.""

The virus outbreak comes just before the start of the Lunar New Year holiday, a time when millions of Chinese travel to be with their families, increasing the potential for the disease to spread, according to the BBC.

"Biden benefits: Coronavirus lets him avoid public, where he is 'prone' to gaffes","(WASHINGTON EXAMINER) -- The coronavirus pandemic is providing a political boost to Joe Biden, enabling him to avoid campaign rallies and other public gatherings where he is prone to verbal miscues that could hamper his bid to oust President Trump.
To reduce the spread of COVID-19, candidates in both parties have canceled public gatherings for the foreseeable future, replacing them with virtual events. The unusual development allows Biden to avoid traditional campaign rallies and town hall meetings, where he has occasionally faced hecklers, made news for sparse attendance, gotten into angry arguments with attendees, or obscured his message with headline-grabbing slip-ups. Biden is often at his best in controlled settings, and that could pay dividends against Trump if the coronavirus crisis persists.

The governor of Nevada barred the use of anti-malaria drugs within the state after President Donald Trump said the medication could potentially be used as treatment for COVID-19.
Democratic Nevada Gov. Stephen Sisolak signed an emergency order Tuesday barring the use of the anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for treating patients diagnosed with coronavirus, the Associated Press reported. The governor, who did not respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation, reasoned that neither experts nor Nevada doctors have a consensus on whether the drugs can treat coronavirus patients.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

His order came just days after Trump announced that the Federal Drug Administration is waiving “outdated rules and bureaucracies” to test various “anti-viral therapies” that might combat the virus. This includes the malaria drugs.
“It’s shown very encouraging early results, and we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately,” the president said. “And that’s where the FDA has been so great.”

The FDA reports that studies are underway to “determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19.”
“The FDA has been working closely with other government agencies and academic centers that are investigating the use of the drug chloroquine, which is already approved for treating malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease,” the FDA said in a March 19 statement, according to an FDA press release.
FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, M.D. said: “We also must ensure these products are effective; otherwise we risk treating patients with a product that might not work when they could have pursued other, more appropriate, treatments, At the same time, we will engage with domestic manufacturers to ramp up production of this product to mitigate any potential supply chain pressures.”
“If clinical data suggests this product may be promising in treating COVID-19, we know there will be increased demand for it,” Hahn added. “We will take all steps to ensure chloroquine remains available for patients who take it to treat severe and life-threatening illnesses such as lupus.”
A nationwide shortage of the drugs is reportedly spurred by doctors prescribing the medication for themselves and for their families, ProPublica reported.

“It’s disgraceful, is what it is. And completely selfish,” executive director of the Illinois Pharmacists Association Garth Reynolds told the publication. The Illinois Pharmacists Association began receiving emails and calls from members Saturday who said they were receiving questionable prescriptions, ProPublica reported.
Reynolds said the IPA has begun efforts to urge doctors against this.
“We even had a couple of examples of prescribers trying to say that the individual they were calling in for had rheumatoid arthritis,” he said. “I mean, that’s fraud.”

"Action by China would have curbed coronavirus cases by 95%, says study","
If Chinese authorities had acted three weeks earlier than they did, the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by 95% and its geographic spread limited, according to an analysis by Axios.

The analysis comes amid a Times of London report that Chinese scientists destroyed lab research on the coronavirus and suppressed news in the early weeks of the outbreak, notes the Legal Insurrection blog.
The latest figures for the global pandemic are 241,563 cases, 9,882 deaths and 86,689 recoveries.
Axios cited a study published in March by the University of Southampton in England finding that immediate action by Chinese authorities could have reduced the number of cases by 95%.

A timeline compiled by Axios of the early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak shows a cover-up by Chinese communist officials during which actions were delayed.
It came from information reported by the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, the South China Morning Post and other sources.

Destroy and suppress
Meanwhile, an independent, investigative journalism team at Caixin Global cited by the Times of London reported details of the cover-up.
In late December last year, Chinese laboratories identified a highly infectious mystery virus but were ordered to stop tests, destroy samples and suppress the news, reporters found.
The Times said a regional health official at the center of the outbreak in Wuhan demanded the destruction of the lab samples on Jan. 1.
At that time, China insisted there was no human-to-human transmission of the virus before acknowledging the truth three weeks later.

On Jan. 3, China's top medical authority, the National Health Commission, issued a gag order instructing laboratories not to release any information and to hand over or destroy the samples.
A team from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control that was sent to Wuhan on Jan. 8 was deliberately not informed that medical staff already had been infected by patients.
The Times noted it was a clear confirmation that the disease was contagious.

Chinese doctor who first warned about coronavirus dies,"The Chinese doctor who was allegedly detained in China for trying to warn his fellow medics about the coronavirus outbreak has died from the virus itself.
Li Wenliang was an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital who sent out a warning about the coronavirus to his colleagues on Dec. 30, according to the BBC.

Li had observed seven cases of a virus that looked like SARS, and he cautioned his fellow doctors to wear protective clothing to avoid possible infection.
The Public Security Bureau summoned Li four days later and forced him to sign a letter saying that he was ""making false comments.""
Seven other people were investigated as well for ""spreading rumors.""

Authorities later apologized to the doctor for their actions.
Li wrote in a post on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging website, that he had begun coughing on Jan. 10.

Days later, he was admitted to a hospital, and eventually diagnosed with coronavirus on Jan. 30.
There were initially conflicting reports about his death, with Chinese state-run media first reporting he had died, and later saying he was actually in critical condition.
Later Tuesday, Wuhan Central Hospital announced he had in fact died, according to Fox News.

It is unknown at this time if Li had any other underlying health conditions or complications with the virus.

Coronavirus: A psychic's prediction and China's secrets,"The human brain is an amazing organ in its ability to create and predict. Consider, for example, the first design of a helicopter-like machine. It was drawn a year after Christopher Columbus discovered America – four and a half centuries before that aircraft actually became a reality – by Leonardo da Vinci. Was da Vinci just an inventor born way before his time, or was he psychic?
A similar query arises now in the wake of China's coronavirus as we examine two sources describing it decades prior to its 2020 emergence onto the world stage. Do these sources give us further insights into how the coronavirus may have started and what its impact will be?
Advertisement - story continues below
A novel written almost 40 years ago seems most prophetic today, especially since the coronavirus began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. In his 1981 novel ""The Eyes of Darkness,"" Dean Koontz wrote details about a fictional event involving China's ""most important and dangerous new biological weapon,"" known as ""Wuhan-400."" Although Koontz fictionalized Wuhan-400 as unable to survive outside the human body more than a minute, coronavirus can. But a theory gaining support about coronavirus he promoted is that it is the product of a biological warfare (BW) effort by Chinese scientists at their research lab outside Wuhan.
Today, it is known secret BW programs are run at the Wuhan lab – a facility with the capability to develop some of the most deadly pathogens on earth. It is also very likely the lab does not employ the strict protocols necessary to prevent those pathogens from escaping into the environment. This would explain why coronavirus initially established such a large footprint in that city before going international.
Evidence now points to coronavirus making its great escape from the lab either via an infected worker or one who illegally sold infected lab animals to the public.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

While Koontz's virus was one birthed within the mind of a creative writer, much more compelling is a prediction made by psychic Sylvia Browne. In her 2008 book ""End of Days,"" she nails the date coronavirus would make its first appearance. China issued a coronavirus warning on New Year's Eve, Dec. 31, 2019; Browne's book predicted, ""In around 2020 a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe. …"" She went on to provide a very accurate description of the respiratory impact the virus would have before predicting the course it would then take, ""… attacking the lungs and bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments. Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again 10 years later, and then disappear completely.""
While Browne does not explain the origin of coronavirus, it does strongly support a biologically developed weapon that somehow escaped from the lab and may do so again in 10 years.

Coronavirus may well have evolved as a project undertaken due to a secret briefing given in China to high-level Communist Party cadres two decades ago by Defense Minister Gen. Chi Haotian. Chi reportedly explained how China's biggest 21st-century need was ""living space"" for an expanding population – not domestic space, but extra-territorial space for ""mass colonization."" He shared his sinister solution on how to lay claim to Western countries, avoiding a nuclear exchange to preserve foreign territory.
Chi said, ""We are not as foolish as to want to perish together with America by using nuclear weapons. Only by using non-destructive weapons that can kill many people will we be able to reserve America for ourselves."" Unbelievably, Chi was laying the groundwork for a solution that involved killing millions of Americans but leaving the country undamaged by a non-destructive BW weapon.
Lest it be thought these were simply the ravings of a mad man, it should be noted Chi stepped down from office in 2003 – the same year the SARS pandemic began in China.
What is playing out in China now as the coronavirus footprint increases is something one would only expect to read about in a novel – not in real life. In an effort to keep a cap on the real number of victims, the Chinese government has quietly been cremating thousands of bodies.
Satellite photographs of Wuhan reveal all 49 crematoriums in full operation 24/7. High levels of sulphur dioxide (SO2) gas have been detected. While this is indicative of medical waste being incinerated, it is also a telltale sign of human remains being burned. A Czech-based weather service, Windy.com, has determined the SO2 levels to be almost three times that considered safe. A Chinese billionaire who left China for his personal safety claims based on his contacts the death toll could be as high as 50,000.
Advertisement - story continues below
Social media has been a curse for Chinese officials trying to contain information about the impact of the virus. Crematorium owners use it as a platform for airing grievances on how they are unable to keep up with demand in the quarantined areas.
This is supported by a recent Chinese government order that minimal funerals are to be held and corpses ""cremated close by and immediately."" Some outside experts monitoring the evidence out of China warn that deaths are way under-reported.
Before coronavirus spread its wings internationally, the fact that the 1,000-bed Huoshenshan Hospital in the epicenter of the virus was built in just 10 days suggests the government recognized a major health problem was brewing. Since then, social media has shown us scenes of Chinese government medical teams pulling those who are possibly infected out of their homes and taking them to undisclosed locations. We also have learned doors to apartments occupied by victims have actually been welded shut to prevent them from leaving. Meanwhile, Beijing suggests the West is ""overreacting"" to the virus.
As if Chinese BW development is not concern enough, there is another national security issue that should alarm us. About 85% of our pharmaceuticals and vitamins are manufactured in China. This is concerning for two reasons. With China shutting down manufacturing under imposed quarantines, the availability of such products in the U.S. will be negatively impacted. More worrisome is the capability China has in wartime to either disrupt or taint this drug pipeline.
Advertisement - story continues below
Psychic Sylvia Browne has proven deadly accurate in her predicted timing of the coronavirus explosion and its respiratory impact. If the rest of her prediction is correct, we can expect the virus to suddenly end, only to reappear again by 2030. We must demand China provide a full accounting on how coronavirus really originated and the true extent to which its population has been impacted.
Browne's 2030 prediction suggests China will neither cooperate nor be truthful in its revelations, and we will see the coronavirus rear its ugly head again. It would be unwise to bet against a psychic who has proven to be spot on about the deadly virus.

"Beijing news outlet risks it all, says China is 'faking coronavirus recovery'","Months after the novel coronavirus first appeared and spread like wildfire across the People's Republic of China, the communist nation has seemingly made a miraculous recovery.
A herculean effort that saw mass mobilization, rapid hospital construction, and downright draconian enforced quarantines soon resulted in a drastic decline of reported COVID-19 cases, giving hope to the rest of the world -- at least from official reports.
Advertisement - story continues below
According to one Chinese news outlet, however, the country is more of a paper tiger than a resilient dragon.
Beijing-based Caixin made the claim earlier this month that China is far from recovered -- and that ""local governments are faking coronavirus recovery.""
The paper cites business insiders across the country that claim to be unable to fill quotas set by the government, thanks to workers who being unable to return to work.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

The quotas don't seem to be set on production, but rather consumption, of electricity that is.
In order to appear to be up and running, according to Caixin, local managers are making sure they're using power on a regular basis, even if they're not actually in operation.
Advertisement - story continues below
The headline on the March 4 article said it all: ""Lights Are On but No One’s Working: How Local Governments Are Faking Coronavirus Recovery.""
The article explained:
""Leaving lights and air conditioners on all day long in empty offices, turning on manufacturing equipment, faking staff rosters and even coaching factory workers to lie to inspectors are just some of the ways they helped manufacture flashy statistics on the resumption of business for local governments to report up the chain.""
A factory burning through electricity must be producing something, the thinking of Chinese officials appears to be.
Of course, another explanation is it's easier to simply compare power consumption pre-virus and post-virus from a cushy central party office in Beijing.
Advertisement - story continues below
So instead of failing their communist overlords, the managers simply fix the numbers.
Power consumption is ramped up to simulate a fully-functioning factory, often by leaving lights and air conditioning running all day long. Industrial equipment is left on, producing nothing of value besides an upward trend on a Beijing-bound spreadsheet as it idles.
While Caixin's bombshell claims don't seem to be that much of a danger to report, it comes at a time when China cannot afford to lose face in the international community.
Battling a movement spearheaded by President Donald Trump to lay blame for the coronavirus pandemic on the communist nation's mismanagement and lies, China has sought allies to push the narrative that the virus originated in America.
Advertisement - story continues below
Already, longtime adversaries of the United States like Iran and Russia have begun parroting this disinformation.
China punished whistleblowers in the early days of the country's own outbreak, leading to a throttle on information that allowed the viral pathogen to spread like wildfire.
One of the silenced voices belonged to a Chinese doctor, one of the first to recognize the new SARS-like coronavirus for the danger that it was. He later died of COVID-19.
Working under a government with an attitude like that, it's clear that Caixin and the people behind its bombshell story are risking their careers and possibly their freedom to expose the truth.
Advertisement - story continues below
While heroic Chinese journalists are working to break through the lies of their communist government, many of our own mainstream media groups are busy pushing the foreign country's narrative.
It can never be forgotten that the virus originated in China, and was allowed to escape containment thanks to the Chinese government.

He had pre-existing medical conditions stemming from his work at Ground Zero, according to WCBS, including chronic pulmonary disease and reduced lung function.
“John has worn many hats over his lifetime, US Marine, Firefighter, Fire Marshal and Labor Leader, but he will best be remembered as a loving husband, father and friend,” friend Peter Gleason told the Daily News. “John would want his untimely demise to be used to draw attention and resources in finding a cure or vaccine for the coronavirus.""

Knox founded the FDNY union representing fire marshals and investigated hundreds of fires in the 1970s and 1980s.
He also was part of investigations into the terrorist bombings by the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberacion, like the 1975 bombing of Fraunces Tavern.
Knox investigated cases as a private consultant well into his 80s until he was admitted into the hospital.
His family tried to get the hospital to give Remdesivir, an experimental medication developed to fight Ebola, to Knox on Saturday, but because of underlying kidney conditions, doctors could not give it to him.
“The patient -- who had not traveled to any high-risk countries or been exposed to someone with symptoms of COVID-19 -- was admitted to the hospital on Feb. 26th and did not meet the CDC criteria in place at the time for COVID-19 testing,” the hospital said in a statement.

“He did have an underlying chronic health condition as well as new symptoms. He later was diagnosed with COVID-19 and MSSN staff did everything possible but we confirm his death with deep regret and sympathy for his family, many of whom are in self-isolation due to COVID-19 exposure.”
It is currently unclear how he contracted coronavirus, but New York's public health system said that first responders who worked at Ground Zero after 9/11 and survivors of the terrorist attack were at risk, the New York Post reported.
“We do very much worry about people from the World Trade Center incident,” Dr. Mitchell Katz, president of NYC Health + Hospitals said.
“This is New York, right, where we have a number of people who may be suffering from lung dysfunction due to their exposure. So it’s basically that people -- your lung function and structure are not normal -- your risk is greater.”

Following Knox's death, there have been calls for firefighters to be among the first tested for coronavirus when testing kits become available because they are often the first to respond to medical calls.
""We're asking for quicker testing with quicker results,"" Gerard Fitzgerald, president of the Firefighters Union, told WCBS.
He added that nurses and police officers should also be prioritized for testing.

"In era of coronavirus, banning plastic bags could be lethal","By Rebekah Stoeppler
At Walmart, I was used to seeing a lot of dirty bags customers brought in, but these bags were particularly disgusting. Customer service is the No. 1 criterion of my job as a cashier, so instead of declining a particular bag, while the customer loaded the belt, I turned the bag upside down to shake out the animal hair in it. The rain of hair that descended took me by surprise, and I quickly turned the bag upright to not make a bigger mess. Fortunately for me, the customer had enough semi-clean bags that I didn't have to make them bag their own groceries.
Advertisement - story continues below
This event is one of many I see every day at my work, ever since the new bag law came into play in Oregon. I have to deal with disgusting, marijuana-smelling, disease-spreading, smelling-like-a-ripe-litter-box bags that take up a lot of extra time for both me and the customer, since I have to hang them on the roundabout – unless the customer decides to buy more plastic bags, which also happens a lot. There are quite a few customers who aren't ashamed to tell me, ""Don't worry about how many bags I use – I'll just throw them all away and buy more next time!"" And I don't discourage it, because it saves me and the customers time when I can just use the bags already on the roundabout.
Outlawing plastic bags is a way to spread diseases; lack of plastic bags ready to go is inconvenient for both cashier and customer; and so far, because of thicker plastic bag replacements, there is four times as much plastic being used than before the ban.
Forcing people to bring their own bags into stores and forcing cashiers to touch those bags from many different customers all day long, and then touching the next customers merchandise, can spread diseases. Even if all the customer bags were 100% clean, and if we all wore gloves, cashiers would still be spreading germs from customer to customer by touching all their bags as well as their groceries.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Given the prevalence of more common diseases like influenza, it is likely that there already have been some avoidable deaths because of the Oregon bag ban. Influenza only stays viable on a person's skin for 15 minutes, but on inanimate objects, this virus can exist from an hour to a few days, depending on variables such as the composition of the surface, temperature and humidity. Bringing bags into stores increases the risk of disease for all customers and store employees.
As a cashier, I noticed the filth and started collecting data on my customers. Twenty-three percent of the customers bringing bags have bags that are conspicuously dirty, and that's just what's obvious to the naked eye! You can't see diseases or know what all the bags have touched. Besides things like bags full of red meat juices or cat hair, one cashier had a drug needle fall out of a customer's bag! I would wear gloves while cashiering, but that doesn't stop the transfer of filth and disease from one customer's bags to the next customer's unprotected produce. By the time break or lunch comes around and I toss the gloves, they have a thick layer of filth and grime on them. It is disgusting even without the disease-spreading factor.

Filth wasn't the only problem. Inconvenience for both cashiers and customers ensued as well as a great deal of time wasted. Many cashiers take more than twice as long to help their customers because they have to deal with the customers' bags, which are frequently dirty and almost always odd sizes that don't fit well on the Walmart roundabout. Customers bring in enormous reusable bags from clothing stores, Costco, or Amazon, and then complain about how heavy the bags are when the groceries are inside.
People have to have disposable bags to buy raw meat and rotisserie chickens to protect their vehicles, and the bag rule is forcing people to either buy a bag to throw away, reuse a bag with raw meat or rotisserie chicken juice, which is very hazardous to health, or ruin their vehicle seats or floor – since the previous convenient, biodegradable and thin plastic bags are no longer available. Now people who can't afford bags, or don't want to comply with the government's regulations, have to carry all their small items from the store to their car looking like shoplifters, and then from their car to their house in many loads rather than being able to use handy bags that were designed for their convenience. I was shopping at Winco last week, and the cashier told me that ever since the bag rule went into place, their hand shopping baskets have been disappearing by the boatload. He said they've been having to restock them every month.
If you think that you're saving the whales by reducing plastic, I'm sorry to disappoint you – not only are plastic grocery bags a very minor part of the plastic being used, but we are now using more plastic than we were before. (See graph below.)

Before the bag law was put in place, we had thin plastic bags that were convenient for people to carry their groceries in, and they were sanitary. Now we have 9.5 times heavier plastic bags than what we had before! My customers' biggest complaint since the bag rule, besides not voting for such an outrageous law, is their lack of free grocery bags for their trashcans. Now, they have thicker plastic bags, and 65% of my customers who don't bring bags still buy them. About 25% of my customers who buy bags get them ""free"" from government aid, EBT (food stamps) and WIC, but the rest of them just keep buying the bags and throwing them away.
I hear comments from customers such as (angrily), ""I didn't vote for this rule,"" (friendly-like), ""They're only 5 cents? To make it more convenient for you, I'll just buy more even though I brought my own bags,"" (some making excuses, some apologetically), ""I forgot them in the car, so I'll buy more,"" (gloatingly), ""I always throw them out and buy new ones,"" (disappointed and very fragile little old lady), 'I never shopped at Winco or Costco because they didn't bag my groceries, now I don't know what to do!"" (bossy), ""I always buy bags because of cross-contamination, don't try to save me money on bags, use another one!"" and so on.
Right now, there is a pandemic of the coronavirus disease spreading all over the world, and despite our president's efforts to keep it at bay, this disease has managed to creep into the U.S. There are over 4,000 people who died in less than two months from COVID-19, and the number of cases is continually going up.
Oregon's plastic bag rule (and others like it in other states) has the potential to spread this disease as well as any other disease. Making cashiers and customers go through this inconvenience is completely unnecessary, especially when we're actually using more plastic than we were before! But plastic is not a problem. It's a substance that's very easy to dispose of. It can be burned for electricity, and it is biodegradable. The plastic in the ocean is eaten up by microorganisms, and the only trash that survives is some close to the shore that gets washed up, which is what the leftists use to say that ""plastic is destroying the earth.""

This is what happens when we have bureaucrats and politicians tell us how we should live our lives. They think they can tell us how to live – why should we have other people telling us that? Our country was founded to be ""home of the brave and land of the free,"" and these know-nothing-never-held-a-job-in-their-lives bureaucrats are forcing us to live their ideal lives instead of just leaving us alone!

"Limbaugh: Coronavirus is less deadly than flu, but 'weaponized' to bring down Trump","Rush Limbaugh (Video screenshot courtesy RushLimbaugh.com)
The headlines on Monday once again were filled with the coronavirus.

There were reports the outbreak could cause the Tokyo Olympics to be moved, thousands are lining up to buy face masks and cases in Italy skyrocketed as buying panics hit certain areas, leaving store shelves empty.
And the New York Stock Exchange was down by roughly 3% for a time.
But the truth is, contends talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh, that the coronavirus ""is the common cold.""

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

It is being ""weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump,"" he said.
""The Drive-By Media hype of this thing as a pandemic, as the Andromeda strain, as, 'Oh, my God. If you get it, you're dead,' do you know what the — I think the survival rate is 98%,"" he said.

""Ninety-eight percent of people get the coronavirus survive. It's a respiratory system virus. It probably is a ChiCom laboratory experiment that is in the process of being weaponized. All superpower nations weaponize bioweapons. They experiment with them. The Russians, for example, have weaponized fentanyl,"" he said.
The coronavirus is ""really being hyped as a deadly Andromeda Strain or Ebola pandemic that, 'Oh, my God, is going to wipe out the nation. It's going to wipe out the population of the world,'"" he said.
A 2% fatality rate likely is actually ""less than the flu, folks,"" he said. In fact, WebMD reports recent annual flu fatality tolls have ranged up to 49,000. The CDC's estimate is higher, blaming the flu for up to 61,000 deaths annually, The National Institutes of Health cited a World Health Organization estimate that there could be as many as 650,000 flu deaths annually around the world. Coronavirus so far is being blamed for a little over 2,000 deaths.
""Do not misunderstand. I’m not trying to get you to let your guard down,"" he said. But ""we're not talking about something here that’s gonna wipe out your town or your city if it finds its way there. This is a classic illustration of how media coverage works. Even if this media coverage isn't stacked, even if this is just the way media normally does things, this is a hyped, panic-filled version. It's exactly how the media deals with these things to create audience, readership, interest, clicks, what have you.""
He said the media's goal is to attack Trump.

""One of the ways it's being used to do this is to scare the investors, to scare people in business. It's to scare people into not buying Treasury bills at auctions. It's to scare people into leaving, cashing out of the stock market — and sure enough, as the show began today, the stock market — the Dow Jones Industrial Average — was down about 900 points, supposedly because of the latest news about the spread of the coronavirus,"" he said.
But it won't work, said Limbaugh.
""It's one of the latest in a long line of efforts that the Drive-By Media's making to somehow say that Trump and capitalism are destroying America and destroying the world. Just keep in mind where the coronavirus came from. It came from a country that Bernie Sanders wants to turn the United States into a mirror image of: Communist China. That's where it came from. It didn't come from an American lab. It didn't escape from an American research lab. It hasn't been spread by Americans. It starts out in a communist country. Its tentacles spread all across the world in numbers that are not big and not huge, but they're being reported as just the opposite.""

Buzz Aldrin's hilarious take on coronavirus is what we all need to hear,"It's like the old Nike-Bo Jackson ad: Buzz knows quarantines.
As the second man on the moon, Buzz Aldrin was subject to a few back before we knew our most prominent satellite was a cold, dead world and not filled with microbes that would attach themselves to the boots of moon-walkers and hitch a ride back to earth.
Advertisement - story continues below
As such, he knows how all of us feel right now -- and he's also going through it as well. Aldrin is 90, which obviously puts him in a high-risk category.
So, how's he coping with the situation? How is he social distancing?
""Lying on my a-- and locking the door,"" he told Ars Technica.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

That's certainly one way to do it.
The answer came about when Ars Technica's Eric Berger spoke to Aldrin on Tuesday and asked him for his advice about what we're all going through at the moment with COVID-19.
Advertisement - story continues below
""After the Apollo 11 Command Module landed in the Pacific Ocean, the three lunar astronauts were ushered from their life raft onto the USS Hornet aircraft carrier,"" Berger wrote.
""Once aboard the ship, they immediately went into a converted Airstream trailer known as the mobile quarantine facility. This trailer was flown by a C-141 aircraft to Houston, where the crew subsequently spent about three weeks inside a 'secure' building known as the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.""
What was the quarantine experience like?
""Well, Mike Collins and I used to exercise and jog a little bit around the hallway,"" Aldrin said.
""We looked at this one crack in the floor, and there were ants crawling in and out.""

Buzz Aldrin has had plenty of experience. https://t.co/4wsB1AmLHx

As you can probably guess, microbes are smaller than ants and, if evil moon microbes existed, this would be a pretty good time for them to make their way out.
There weren't, of course, and the most dangerous living things inside that Airstream were probably some very ornery astronauts.
Advertisement - story continues below
So, how did Aldrin pass the time aside from jogging in the hallway of an Airstream?
Well, he filled out some paperwork -- including a government travel voucher entitling him to $33.31 for his trip back and forth to the moon, courtesy of the federal government.
Hey, say what you will, but $33.31 in 1969 is worth roughly $235 in today's coin. That's Nintendo Switch money right there.
What should we take from Aldrin's response to the coronavirus, aside from the fact that you should always get every dollar you can from the federal government?

First, if you're old, you need to quarantine. Lay on your posterior. Do whatever you need to in order to not get infected.
It's not just a matter of not taking resources, it's a matter of staying alive.
Beyond that, relax a bit. Have a sense of humor.
We'll get through this. Worse things have happened.

Researchers identify 2 coronavirus strains as China cases dwindle,"(REUTERS) Scientists in China studying the outbreak of disease caused by the new coronavirus say they have found that two main strains of the virus are circulating in humans and causing infections.

The researchers, from Peking University’s School of Life Sciences and the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, cautioned that their study looked only at a limited range of data, and said follow-up studies of larger data sets were needed to better understand the virus’s evolution.

The preliminary study found that a more aggressive strain of the new coronavirus associated with the outbreak in Wuhan accounted for about 70% of analyzed cases, while 30% were linked to a less aggressive type.

The prevalence of the more aggressive virus type decreased after early January 2020, they said.

Can coronavirus info from China be trusted?,"The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) has reached 9,776, with 213 deaths, according to the interactive map provided by Johns Hopkins CSSE (Center for Systems Science and Engineering).
But is it plausible that China, the source of the outbreak, has locked down 17 cities because of 213 deaths?

A Jan. 28 directive issued by China's Ministry of Public Security ordered all police departments throughout the country to make ""wartime preparations."" The police are to help ""control the disease"" by enforcing quarantine orders and helping to speed the distribution of medical supplies, while at the same time ""maintaining social stability"" by ""severely"" punishing any public or online reporting about the spread of the epidemic.
A tweet read: ""The [Wuhan] city government and Hubei Provincial Civil Affairs Ministry have dispatched vehicles, staff, and protective gear to each funeral house [in Wuhan]."" The post went on to offer ""free cremation for the corpses of coronavirus victims"" who died on Jan. 26 or later. The reason the city was deploying these new resources, it said, was ""to improve the capacity of transporting and dealing with corpses.""
The tweet obviously didn't please the censors, writes Steven Mosher. An hour later the above sentences were deleted from the text.

Crematorium workers in the city of Wuhan claim that bodies are being sent from hospitals without being added to the official record.
The first wave of cases must have occurred in December or earlier because by Jan. 2, 41 cases admitted to hospital in Wuhan had a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of 2019-nCoV. But Wuhan was not placed under quarantine until 5 million people had left to celebrate the New Year, carrying the virus all across China.

Before the 1918 influenza epidemic, a solo, horse-and-buggy physician in Kansas, Dr. Loring Miner, made the correct diagnosis of an unusually lethal outbreak of influenza and did all he could to sound the alarm. The U.S. Public Health Service ignored him, writes John M. Barry in his 2004 book, ""The Great Influenza: the Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History."" Might social media have stopped that epidemic in its tracks?
China's ""Great Firewall"" is the most sophisticated internet censorship operation in the world. Google's secret Project Nightingale to facilitate the Chinese dictatorship's censorship has apparently been stymied for now. However, U.S. providers of online services have yielded to pressure from Rep. Adam Schiff to suppress material he deems inappropriate for the public access. At the moment, this is restricted to information on adverse reactions to vaccines. The suppression of free speech and public access to government-disfavored views is the subject of a lawsuit by the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS).

Arab media: Coronavirus a sinister U.S. plot,"The coronavirus under a microscope (Wikimedia Commons)
The deadly coronavirus now spreading from China is the product of a sinister plot by the United States, according to several Arab writers in the Middle East.
Advertisement - story continues below
Some say the U.S. is trying to profit by selling vaccines to treat the coronavirus and other viruses, according to the Middle East Media Research Institute, or MEMRI. Others see it as part of an economic and psychological war waged by the U.S. against other nations.
The aim, the writers say, is to weaken China and make it appear to be a third-world nation incapable of handling such an outbreak.
In the Saudi daily Al-Watan, writer Sa'ud Al-Shehry claimed the coronavirus was a plot by American and Israeli drug companies aimed at increasing their profits.

""A 'wonder' virus was discovered yesterday in China; tomorrow it will be discovered in Egypt, but it will not be discovered either today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow in the U.S. or Israel, nor in poor countries such as Burundi or the Comoro Islands,"" he wrote, according to MEMRI.
He wrote that the coronavirus, known to have been discovered in 1960, has normal flu symptoms, including coughing, congestion, diarrhea and fever. It's strange, therefore, Shehry said, to hear the World Health Organization saying ""this is a virus first discovered in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, in a camel.""

""And here is something else that's strange: As soon as Egypt announced a few years ago"" that it no longer needed poultry from the U.S., France and other countries, suddenly ""there appeared, from underneath the ground, the avian flu virus.""
It had the aim, the writer said, of ""nipping Egypt's [economic] awakening in the bud.""
Hussein Saqer, a columnist for the Syrian daily Al-Thawra, made similar claims in a Feb. 3 column.
He said the coronavirus was part of a commercial-biological-psychological war waged by the U.S. against China.
""From Ebola, zika, SARS, avian flu and swine flu, through anthrax and mad cow disease to the corona[virus] – [all these] deadly viruses were manufactured by the U.S. and threaten to annihilate the peoples of the world,"" he wrote.

Sager said the U.S. ""has turned biological warfare into a new type of war, by means of which it intends to change the rules of play and shift the conflict with the peoples [of the world] away from the conventional path.""
On the Egyptian news website Vetogate.com, journalist Ahmad Rif'at explained why the U.S. chose the Chinese city of Wuhan as the epicenter of the disease.
""American factories are the first to manufacture every kind of virus and bacteria, from the virulent smallpox virus and the bubonic plague virus to all the viruses we saw in the recent years, such as mad cow disease and swine flu,"" he wrote.
Rif'at claimed the biological ""war is not only intended to worry China, trouble it and cause it to spend billions of dollars on emergency measures and medicines – which, by the way, will be manufactured by an Israeli company.""

Moreover, the congressman voiced concerns about a plan that calls for stockpiling masks and other medial supplies without a distribution plan attached to ensure they reach front-line medical professionals and do not end up stacked in warehouses.
During his on-air appearance, Buck decried the political blame game in which Trump has been attacked by Democrats over the outbreak of a virus that has impacted nations around the world.
""I work on Capitol Hill and I see politics every day,"" Buck said. ""And unfortunately, I see people that try to make political gain out of things that they should not try to make political gain out of.

""By passing this larded-up bill, Congress again fails to wisely appropriate taxpayer dollars. I would have supported the president’s request for $2.5 billion, knowing that, if we spent all the funds, Congress could have provided additional funding.""

$2 trillion in welfare + dictatorial orders = socialist gulag,"We now know that the coronavirus-caused COVID-19 is here to stay; it is forecast to be recurring at least every flu season, hopefully in a lesser degree. Just ask the National Institutes of Health's Dr. Anthony Fauci and a number of other medical experts. For this simple reason, the $2 trillion bailout just approved by the establishment politicians of both political parties is just the beginning of the permanent socialization and indeed borderline communization of the nation.
We know from past experience that with all of the taxes taken from the American people to support government handouts, once we offer freebees to the masses, they will never want to or practically speaking be taken off the dole, much likes pigs at the trough. Few if any politicians would ever dare to suggest this, for fear that he or she would not be reelected.

Couple this with the massive fraud the bailout will encourage, where dishonest employers will ""lay off"" their employees who will then collect government benefits, but also continue to work under the table, and you have a massive racketeering enterprise the likes of which the country has never experienced. Already, huge fraud, regrettably, frequently occurs with regard to so-called social welfare programs, with dishonest Americans defrauding the taxpayers of billions of dollars.
How did we get to this point, and will there be no turning back?
First, the nation was aware post-9/11 that we would likely someday be hit with either a biological attack or a negligently or naturally generated pandemic. I am old enough to remember the days when we all thought that terrorists would inflict more pain and damage on the citizenry. But what did our so-called leaders in the sleazy swamps of Washington, D.C. and our state capitols do? NOTHING!

Second, contrary to alleged trade policies in successive administrations from Clinton, to Bush, to Obama, we encouraged our multi-national companies to invest in foreign plants producing strategic and necessary products, such as medicines, in countries hostile to the United States – China and Vietnam being just two examples. Now, we are faced with having to get down on our knees to China in particular, where its evil Communist government has now, in this time of crises, cleverly and effectively blackmailed President Trump not to hold the Chicoms accountable for the massive if not prohibitive damage caused to our health, welfare and sinking economy.
As of today's date, only Freedom Watch and its now over 500 brave class-action clients are seeking to have the Chinese government pay for what is in effect a terrorist attack that threatens to take the republic down for the final count. Indeed, the U.S. Justice Department just this week threatened to prosecute as terrorists those who intentionally attempt to or actually spread the coronavirus.

Third, as Americans are prone to do, there is a vast overreaction to the virus. Even some families now refuse to come into contact, within the recommended six feet of distance, with other family members for fear that imaginary ""family lepers"" will infect them, even when there is no showing that COVID-19 has been contracted. What caused this social breakdown, which is dividing families and separating us from our other loved ones and friends?
The answer lies with the media and in particular the cable networks, all whores of the highest magnitude. Just turn on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN (Newsmax TV is nearly unviewable given its extremely poor transmission video), and you will see hosts whipping up fear and panic for profit. Look to the right of the television screen and see charts with the death count mounting, moment by moment – even when the deaths are miniscule compared to cigarette deaths, car and motorcycle accidents and other effects of taking some risk in daily life.
What is the motive of the cables? To cause viewers, who are now largely at home, to watch continuously throughout the day and night in macabre fashion, waiting for the final apocalypse to drop. The more audiences tune in the more the networks can charge advertisers. This fills the coffers of the networks and by extension the paychecks of the people who work for them. Note that you see very few unhappy faces on Fox News, CNN and MSNBC – they are as happy about their guaranteed employment and the growing wealth of their employers as pigs rolling in their dung. To say this is disgraceful is too kind!
Fourth, couple this with state governors and other elected officials who have issued draconian and dictatorial stay-at-home orders, and you not only increase panic but also assert near total government control of the populace – socialist/communist style. On behalf of Ben Stein, I just filed suit to challenge Gov. Gavin Newsom's dictatorial order in California. Go to www.freedomwatchusa.org to read the complaint.
Yes, the $2 trillion bailout, to use a politically correct term that is unwarranted, plus the near dictatorial control of government, will eventually, if it continues, lead to a Soviet style gulag. Karl Marx is laughing in his grave, and his disciples, growing in large number in our nation, are happy as punch.

""These questions are important not only for this current situation, but to inform future outbreak preparation and better understand animal/human and environmental transmission aspects of coronaviruses,"" director Kevin K. Droegemeier wrote.
""This review will aid preparedness for future events by establishing a process that quickly assembles subject matter experts for evaluating other potentially threatening organisms.""
Droegemeir requested for NASEM -- made up of private, nonprofit institutions charged with providing scientific support to the federal government -- to hold a meeting of ""experts, particularly world class geneticists, coronavirus experts, and evolutionary biologists"" to draw its conclusions.

Marcia McNutt, the president of the organization, thanked Droegemeir for the timeliness of his letter ""given the declaration of a public health emergency and potential for misinformation to confound the response,"" in her responding letter on Thursday.
McNutt was referencing the efforts made by governments and social media companies to stop the spread of misinformation about the virus that has infected over 34,000 people and killed at least 724 since December.

McNutt wrote that while the research of the origin of coronavirus was already underway, the organization ""consulted leading experts in the fields of virology, infectious disease genomics, genome sciences, epidemiology, microbiology, immunobiology, coronaviruses, emerging infections, biosecurity, and global health"" to get their take on the data available.
The experts informed NASEM that additional ""genomic sequence data from geographically- and temporally-diverse viral samples"" was needed in order to properly identify the origin of the virus.
""International collaboration of this kind is more important than ever to overcome these types of global challenges,"" McNutt wrote.
As these letters were exchanged in the United States, the first U.S. citizen died Thursday from coronavirus at a hospital in Wuhan, according to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
Little information has been released about the victim.

The embassy did say he or she was about 60 years old.
“We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss,” the embassy said in a statement to The New York Times.
“Out of the respect for the family’s privacy, we have no further comment.”
The United States has evacuated hundreds of Americans from Wuhan, China, where the virus emerged in December, CNN reported.

China has become more aggressive in its effort to blame the United States for the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, charged it was ""extremely irresponsible"" for media to say the virus originated in China, suggesting the U.S. Army brought it to Wuhan.

Then, President Trump's repeated reference to the ""Chinese virus"" prompted China's demand that the U.S. ""correct the mistake immediately.""
Now, Gordon Chang, a senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute, contends China's blame-America campaign shows communism is worse than the virus.
""China's communism is not an enemy. It is the enemy,"" he wrote. ""After the coronavirus pandemic subsides, Americans should not forget Beijing's malicious campaign against their country.""
Advertisement - story continues below
He pointed out that the regime has been ""trying to tar the Trump administration.""
Trump noted at a White House press conference that the Chinese leaders ""know where [the virus] came from.""
Change wrote that it's worse ""if Chinese officials in fact knew where the coronavirus originated.""
""In this case, these officials, by going out of their way to blame the U.S., were demonstrating once again the inherent hostility of their system to America,"" he wrote.

That hostility has included China nationalizing an American factory making medical masks, and forcing a ship carrying masks, gloves and other protective gear to the United States to return to China.
The crisis undoubtedly will impact trade, he said.
Trump has insisted the recently signed first phase of the trade deal is still in effect.
""Trump's optimism is not shared in Beijing, however. China, using the epidemic as an excuse, is now pushing to change the agreement by deferring its purchase obligations, the heart of the arrangement as far as the U.S. is concerned,"" Chang wrote.

Ultimately, however, it may boost Trump's objective of bringing manufacturing back home.
""The president has evidently been thinking about these matters for a long time. On July 21, 2017, for instance, he issued his Executive Order on Assessing and Strengthening the Manufacturing and Defense Industrial Base and Supply Chain Resiliency of the United States. The Defense Industrial Base study, as it is known, exposed American vulnerabilities and led to actions to encourage manufacturing to return home. Trump can now use his sweeping powers granted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to continue this essential process,"" he wrote.
Chang warned of the communist regime's willingness, however, to injure the innocent.
It has ""demonstrated that it has, for instance, little reluctance to injure Americans,"" he said.

""China, as we now know, allowed the coronavirus to spread for six weeks in December and January before Xi publicly acknowledged the disease. So, it is no surprise that Americans — and the Chinese people, who are now demanding fundamental political change — realize that the real disease is communism.""

There was suspicion the Chinese coronavirus was a bioweapon developed in a Wuhan, China, lab that got loose. Then the Chinese government made the completely unfounded claim the U.S. Army had brought it to China as a weapon.
But it still could be considered a weapon, according to the Department of Justice, which has warned that anyone who ""intentionally spread"" the infection could be charged under U.S. terrorism laws, Politico reported.
A memo from Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to DOJ leaders, prosecutors and others said investigators could determine that ""purposeful exposure and infection of others with COVID-19"" is banned by criminal statutes.

""Because coronavirus appears to meet the statutory definition of a 'biological agent' … such acts potentially could implicate the nation’s terrorism-related statutes,"" Rosen explained. ""Threats or attempts to use COVID-19 as a weapon against Americans will not be tolerated.""
Politico said Rosen did not say whether any such threats or intentional exposures had been reported or whether his warning was simply precautionary.

He noted the final version of the relief bill remains to be seen. But Republican ""leaders won't have to contend with at least one thing: abortion funding.""
Under Pelosi's direction, ""in the wee hours of Saturday morning"" the House Democrats ""had tried to tack on a secret slush fund for abortion.""

We need to be ramping up our diagnostic testing, not waging culture wars at the behest of Planned Parenthood. Good grief.""
Trump's intent was clear, as he had written recently: ""As the House conducts its business, I urge that it respect and continue these other important pro-life protections. … I will veto any legislation that weakens current pro-life federal policies or laws – or that encourages the destruction of innocent human life at any stage.""
Perkins said the pressure worked and by the time the House voted, the language that would have compromised the Hyde amendment barring federal funding of abortion services was gone.

There's a new and apparently deadly virus circulating in that country, but what has health officials worldwide worried is that it is spreading faster than first anticipated. It started in Wuhan, China, in late December but by mid-January had spread to 13 countries.
Despite that, World Health Organization officials are reluctant to call it a Public Health Emergency.
What do we call that kind of disease spread?  According to WHO officials, an ""epidemic"" is a disease that spreads in a smaller community, country, region or continent.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

That certainly gives it wide leeway.
The next category is a ""pandemic,"" a disease, usually a new one, that spreads worldwide with terrible numbers of deaths.
Advertisement - story continues below
From what we are seeing now, I think we're well on our way to that situation, although health officials so far are playing it safe with their predictions. 
The culprit is called a ""coronavirus.""  It's new – never been seen before.  We don't know where it came from, There is no prevention, no cure, and even treatment is limited.
What's interesting is that China has a National Biosafety Laboratory in Wuhan.  It opened in January 2018, and it's dedicated to studying such viruses such as SARS and Ebola – and, yes, corona. There has been speculation that perhaps the virus got loose from the lab and that is what started it all.
Regardless, at this point, China has quarantined the entire city of Wuhan and is doing the same with at least 13 other cities, canceled Chinese New Year Celebrations; parts of The Great Wall are shut down; Disneyland in Shanghai is closed, as are many McDonald's restaurants across the country. Millions of people are affected by the crackdown on travel. 
The government had ordered the immediate building of a new hospital to treat coronavirus patients because existing facilities are filled to their limits. Transportation has been limited; the military is on the streets; and in fact, it appears the country is virtually locked down.

While there hasn't been an official notice of the dangers of the massive spread of the disease, airlines and airports across the world are taking precautions.  Passengers are being checked for symptoms of a cold or flu, and their temperatures are being monitored.
Screening at U.S. airports began at Kennedy in New York, in Los Angeles and San Francisco.  Then Atlanta was added, as well as O'Hare in Chicago.  Others are being added as suspicious cases are discovered.
A man in Seattle was diagnosed, then a woman in Chicago who'd just returned from China.  Cases are being monitored in Texas involving a returning passenger from Mexico, and possible patients at Tennessee Tech and Texas A&M.
The CDC is testing 63 other cases, and it's reported there are 10 people in isolation in California for further study.

There is concern about all transportation to and from China of people and merchandise.
While there is caution in predicting the outcome of this disease spread, scientists warn that worldwide, tens of millions could die.  Scientists at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Safety said 65 million could die as the disease spreads worldwide in 18 months.
As I write, coronavirus has been found in China, the U.S., Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Macau, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea, with suspicious cases in Australia, New Zealand, England, Scotland and Ireland – and at least 26 are dead.  That's probably a  gross understatement.  
It isn't known for certain HOW people contract it – first thoughts were that it came from contact with animals, either by contact or through eating them.
Advertisement - story continues below
Now,  it's just been determined that it is possible for it to spread from person-to-person.   Transmission is through saliva, which means that kissing, coughing or sneezing is a danger but eating utensils could also transmit it.  Symptoms are like a cold  – coughing, sneezing, sore throat, runny nose, difficulty breathing, fever and then collapse.  Pneumonia then follows, then death.
We cannot cure it. It's difficult to contain. Antibiotics don't work, and anti-viral drugs and vaccines don't exist, nor will they for a long time – it does take time and costs millions.  For many victims, it will be too late.
This isn't the first time the world has been hit with a massive pandemic – the Spanish Flu in 1918 killed 20-50 million, Cholera flues in the 1800s killed over 2 million, the Black Death in Europe killed upwards of 200 million and devastated the continent. More recently, there was AIDS, Zica, SARS and Ebola.
One aspect of the disease is the effect on the economy.  Without doubt, travel has been affected. It's reported that shares in travel markets in China and Hong Kong dropped, but one market share has surged: companies that make surgical masks!

Is coronavirus an end-time biblical plague?,"Does the book of Revelation predict the coronavirus? Is it one of the prophesied, end-time plagues? If so, does that mean that this is just a harbinger of much worse things to come?
There is no denying the seriousness of the virus.
Advertisement - story continues below
As Bill Gates noted in the New England Journal of Medicine on Feb. 28, ""In the past week, COVID-19 has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we've been worried about."" And even at this early stage, ""COVID-19 has already caused 10 times as many cases as SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] in a quarter of the time.""
And evangelical commentator Michael Snyder included the coronavirus in his ""list of 10 plagues that are hitting our planet simultaneously.""
The ""plagues"" were: 1) Armies Of Locusts; 2) Extremely Bizarre Weather Patterns; 3) Unprecedented Flooding; 4) Major Earthquakes; 5) Unusual Volcanic Eruptions; 6) The Coronavirus; 7) The African Swine Fever; 8) The H1N1 Swine Flu; 9) The H5N1 Bird Flu; 10) The H5N8 Bird Flu.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Does that suggest, then, that COVID-19 is one of the end-time judgments described in Revelation?
Al Mohler noted, ""We are also reminded of Revelation 6:7-8 in which we read, 'When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, ""Come and see."" So I looked and behold a pale horse, and the name of him who sat on it was Death and Hades followed with him.' That fourth horseman has often been associated with plague, with illness, with a violent death by means of this kind of disease, which we now identify primarily with deadly viruses spreading across the human population.""
Advertisement - story continues below
But neither Mohler nor Snyder are suggesting that the virus is one of the final plagues of Revelation. And Gates is certainly not thinking in these terms.
To the contrary, the fact that Gates can describe COVID-19 as a ""once-in-a-century pathogen"" indicates that it is hardly an apocalyptic plague, no matter how deadly it may be.
As underscored by Robert Bartholomew in Psychology Today, ""The Chinese Coronavirus Is Not the Zombie Apocalypse.""
He wrote, ""I am not downplaying the seriousness of the new coronavirus that has been spreading around the world. People are dying and every death is a tragedy. But it is not the end of civilization as we know it – contrary to some media outlets, which risk causing undue alarm and panic.""
In stark contrast, if the book of Revelation does, indeed, describe a series of terrifying, end-time plagues, those plagues will mark the end of civilization as we know it, along with the ushering in of a glorious new age.
Advertisement - story continues below
Again, I'm not minimizing the serious of the virus. And, certainly, ""every death is a tragedy.""
In fact, as I write these words, I'm returning home from Australia via Hong Kong. And I passed through Hong Kong just a few days ago on the way to Australia.
The vast majority of people at the airport in Hong Kong were wearing masks, as was the entire crew during the whole flight. And before you passed through airport security, a wand was held near your forehead to check for fever.
So, again, I recognize the seriousness of this virus. But we minimize the intensity of end-time biblical prophecy by imagining this deadly virus to be an apocalyptic plague.

More importantly, we forget that biblical judgments are connected with clear words of warning.
""Judgment is coming! Repent! Don't let sin destroy you! Turn to God for mercy!""
I did not hear such warnings in the months leading up to COVID-19.
Of course, Christian leaders have been sounding warnings like this for centuries, as did biblical prophets in the centuries before them.

But I personally believe that, as we approach the end of the age, the warnings will become much clearer, calling for specific change in light of specific prophecies, as opposed to a virus just popping up out of the blue.
To be sure, there are many biblical scholars who do not interpret Revelation in this way at all. In their minds, many of the events of the book already took place, described in the highly graphic language called ""apocalyptic.""
Others would argue that most of the events are yet future, but they are cloaked in symbolism and should not be taken literally.
My own understanding is that there will be massive upheaval before the end of the world, in the midst of which there will also be a mighty spiritual outpouring.

But either way, what is clear to me is that we should not view the coronavirus as a prophesied, end-time plague.
Instead, we should view it in the same way we have viewed many other epidemics and pandemics in world history. They are tragic reminders of the broken state of our world and of the frailty of our race. And while doing all we can to prevent and combat the spread of COVID-19, we should pray for the mercy of God.
The final shaking will be far more intense than this.

Coronavirus is drying up supply chains of Southeast Asia's factories,"(QUARTZ) Even as China pushes factories to reopen, the ripple effects of Covid-19 have already proved inescapable for manufacturers outside the country. Particularly hard hit is Southeast Asia, where industries that depend on China for raw materials are being hobbled as their supplies dry up.

In Cambodia, the government today warned about 200 factories making mostly clothing will probably have to slow or cease production entirely due to a lack of raw materials. China—the world’s biggest textile exporter—provides more than 60% of the materials feeding Cambodia’s garment and textile factories, according to the country’s association of garment manufacturers. Prime Minister Hun Sen has publicly urged the Chinese ambassador to send more materials by ship and plane so the industry won’t have to shut down.

Vietnam is facing similar situations in its garment industry and beyond, with China being a major supplier of steel and components for electronics. “Car, electronics and phone manufacturers are experiencing difficulty in acquiring supplies and materials due to disruptions from the virus,” an agency representing Vietnam’s manufacturing sector told Reuters. Phone maker Samsung, which manufactures in Vietnam, is among the companies facing a serious production slowdown. Even the furniture industry, which gets component parts from China, is under duress.

Coronavirus: China resorts to 'wartime' measures in Wuhan,"(LONDON INDEPENDENT) Chinese authorities are resorting to increasingly extreme measures in Wuhan to try to halt the spread of the deadly coronavirus, ordering house-to-house searches, rounding up the sick and warehousing them in enormous quarantine centres.

The urgent, seemingly improvised steps come amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in Wuhan, one exacerbated by tactics that have left this city of 11 million with a death rate from the coronavirus of 4.1 per cent as of Thursday — staggeringly higher than the rest of the country’s rate of 0.17 per cent.

With the sick being herded into makeshift quarantine camps, with minimal medical care, a growing sense of abandonment and fear has taken hold in Wuhan, fuelling the sense that the city and surrounding province of Hubei are being sacrificed for the greater good of China.

Illegals demand DACA be saved due to coronavirus,"
Illegal aliens who have been allowed to remain in the United States because of the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA, argued Friday to the Supreme Court that the program should be preserved because of the coronavirus.

Lawyers claimed in a letter to the court that there are 27,000 DACA recipients working in health care jobs amid the crisis, the Gateway Pundit reported.
""The pandemic sheds new light on the reliance interests of healthcare providers and the public health consequences of ignoring those interests,” the lawyers wrote.
They're appealing an Aug. 31, 2018, ruling by District Court Judge Andrew Hanen that the program is likely unconstitutional because it was never approved by Congress and was enacted unilaterally by President Obama.

4 ways to deal with coronavirus,"What are we to make of the coronavirus? Is it true that God has spoken through modern-day prophets who have declared the virus will be short-lived? Should we believe the theorists who claim the virus is a man-made weapon? And on a practical level, do we follow the hyper-caution of Israel's Netanyahu or the more laid-back approach of President Trump?
As far as prophecies go, Pastor Shawn Boltz posted this on March 3: ""The Lord showed me the end of the coronavirus … the tide is turning now!
Advertisement - story continues below
""He is answering the prayers and cries of the nations and is putting an end in sight. The exaggerated fear-based tactics of both the enemy and several media outlets for political reasons is coming to an end. The enemy has been trying to distract and steal from several equally important purposes and issues by dominating airwaves with conspiracy and fear.
""Even now several vaccines are coming out as well as a natural dying out of the virus itself. The Lord is saying 'I am removing the threat of this.'
""Within a short amount of time the extreme threat will feel like it is in the way past.""

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

As of this writing, there is no end in sight to the virus, although it is allegedly under control in countries like South Korea and China.
So, if this prophecy is to prove true, there will need to be a very quick turnaround.
Advertisement - story continues below
For example, ""German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that up to 70% of the country's population – some 58 million people – could contract the coronavirus.""
And in Italy, ""Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announced the closure of schools, gyms, museums, nightclubs and other venues across the country, which on Wednesday passed 10,000 confirmed infections.""
If Boltz really heard from the Lord, we should see supernatural evidence of it very soon.
As for conspiracy theories, as expected, in some circles the Jews are being blamed for the virus. But this is to be expected. In centuries past, ""the Jews"" were accused of poisoning the wells, leading to the Black Plague.
Now, the Jerusalem Post reports, ""Iran has pushed several reports claiming that 'Zionists' were behind the coronavirus. Press TV also quoted the same website that was at the center of an anti-Semitic article from 2017 that claimed 'America's Jews are driving America's wars.'
Advertisement - story continues below
""On March 5, Press TV claimed that 'Zionist elements developed a deadlier strain of coronavirus against Iran.'""
So, Iran mishandles the outbreak of COVID-19, and it's all the fault of Israel.
A more plausible explanation is that the virus was developed by China. At least that's what my Chinese driver told me after picking me up at the airport in Australia.
He told me quite emphatically that COVID-19 was man-made, developed as a weapon by Chinese scientists.
Advertisement - story continues below
When I asked him where he learned this, he replied, ""The internet.""
But, he was quick to add, the YouTuber he followed was a former Chinese official with excellent, inside intelligence.
A few days later, a friend of mine in New York City, who is a pastor, shared a similar theory with me.
He said that a well-placed friend, formerly a higher-up in the FBI, told him that China developed the virus to hurt the American economy, thereby hurting Trump. And this was in retaliation against Trump for pushing back against China's trade policies.
Advertisement - story continues below
For my part, I'll let the scientists and researchers sort out the question of the origins of the virus. But, for the record, I will make this public statement: I categorically reject the anti-Semitic libel that ""the Jews"" are the cause of COVID-19.
This, then, leaves us with the question of pragmatics.
On March 10, I posted this poll on Twitter: ""Prime Minister Netanyahu is treating the coronavirus as a serious pandemic while President Trump is comparing it to the average flu. Who do you think is right?""
According to Netanyahu, this is a pandemic, because of which he has ordered that everyone arriving in Israel from any country must be quarantined for 14 days. (The World Health Organization, or WHO, just declared the coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic.)

In contrast, Trump tweeted March 9, ""The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, 'The risk is low to the average American.'""
How did my Twitter followers respond? Of the four choices I offered, 14.3% answered, ""Don't know""; 24.3% thought Netanyahu was right; 26.7% thought Trump was right; and 34.8% chose, ""They're both half right.""
How, then, do we sort this out?
A group of experts in Australia predicted ""that even the best-case scenario is 15 million dead and a $2.4 trillion hit to global GDP."" Yes, that was the best-case scenario.
Advertisement - story continues below
According to Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, ""It's the most daunting virus that we've contended with in half a century or more.""
At the same time, other researchers are claiming that the virus is not as deadly as previously reported. Much more deadly than the common flu, for sure. But not as deadly as the WHO has claimed.
What I would suggest is this:
First, there is no reason for panic. Caution, yes. Panic no.
Advertisement - story continues below
Let's remember that the media, by nature, can be sensationalistic. That means that coverage of the coronavirus will also be sensationalistic.
So, analyze the reporting with your head and not just your heart. Then, make wise decisions, especially based on your health. You can be cautious and practical without being in a panic.
Second, for followers of Jesus, there is no room for fear.
If we truly have God as our Father and are in right relationship with Him, we need only fear Him (in a holy, reverential way). We need not fear sudden disaster or wasting disease.
Advertisement - story continues below
He is our shield and our strength. Our lives are in His hands, and we trust Him, whatever comes our way.
Plus, the greatest antidote to fear is a healthy, Bible-based faith. At times like this, it is good to build our faith with passages like Psalm 91.
Third, let's not only think of ourselves. Let's think of others too.
As stated in an open letter by Akos Balogh, the CEO of The Gospel Coalition Australia, ""The truth is, we don't know for sure. And so as a society, we're increasingly anxious. Anxious for our loved ones. Anxious for ourselves. It's a time of fear. But whatever happens, dear Christian, know this: this is our time. God has raised us up for such a time as this. It's no accident you're here. This is our time to think not about ourselves, but about our neighbors – many of whom are scared, and will only grow more so as the virus spreads.""

Let's use this opportunity to brings words of faith to others, to encourage them to put their trust in the Lord, and to let our friends and co-workers and neighbors know, no matter what happens in this world, we can enjoy eternal life in the presence of God.
Fourth, keep on praying for divine intervention, for a speedy end to this virus and for millions of people to turn to Him.
The virus itself is deadly. But we can use it to bring life and hope to many.

Boy, that chaps me — but I bet it’s common in some circles now, Christians shaming other Christians for coronavirus caution. As if being concerned, and taking serious steps to prepare, and to live out public health guidelines, is somehow evidence of a weak commitment to God.
If a Christian chooses not to swim in shark-infested waters, or pick up a poisonous snake, does that show weakness in faith? Of course not; it shows that you have a brain in your head. God’s promise to us is that He will always be with us, not that He will protect us from getting sick from viruses, or otherwise harmed in our bodies. A Christian doctor serves sick patients not because he expects God to place a magic force field around him to keep him from catching their disease, but because he knows that even if he gets sick, that God will be with him through his own suffering, and reward him for his loving self-sacrifice.

The Chinese Communist Party and the World Health Organization made the impact of the coronavirus outbreak many times worse, contends Fox News host Sean Hannity.

He said Thursday night the global crisis would have been prevented ""or at least mitigated"" if not for a cover-up by Chinese officials.
See his comments:


TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

He cited a British university study that concluded up to 95% of coronavirus cases – a quarter of a million cases and more than 10,000 deaths so far – would have been prevented had China and the WHO not hidden the problem for the first weeks as it gained strength.
President Trump this week said he could not yet talk about possible ""repercussions"" for China's behavior.
Advertisement - story continues below
Hannity distilled the facts: When Chinese doctors tried to warn the world about the danger of coronavirus, they were silenced by their own government and many of those doctors now are dead.
Further, in Wuhan, China, where the virus began, city officials held a ""massive potluck dinner"" after the danger was known.
It is ""incomprehensible how dumb that is,"" Hannity said.
He said the World Health Organization, a ""corrupt and frankly useless organization,"" contributed by carrying water for the Chinese communists at the time.
The organization claimed Jan. 14 there was no clear evidence the virus could be transmitted from human to human.
Advertisement - story continues below
That's even though the pandemic was fully underway at the time, with the first known case in the United States Jan. 21. Just 10 days later came Trump's decision to ban travel from China to the U.S.
WHO officials defended China in other ways, Hannity said.
It is WHO that came up with the 3.4% coronavirus death rate, despite evidence it's only a fraction of that.
Trump earlier told Hannity in an interview that simply is a ""false number.""
Advertisement - story continues below
""I think the 3.4 percent is really a false number, now this is just my hunch ... based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this, because a lot of people will have this and it's very mild, they will get better very rapidly, they don't even see a doctor,"" Trump said.
""Again they don't know about the easy cases, because the easy cases don't go to the hospital, they don't report to doctors ... in many cases. So think that number is very high. Personally, I would say that number is way under 1 percent.""
WHO officials said the death rate is created by dividing the number of reported deaths by the number of reported cases. But no one knows the number of unreported cases that, if factored in, would make the mortality rate considerably lower.

An Iraqi political analyst is charging – wildly – that the U.S. is attacking China with the coronavirus.
The stunning claim is from Sabah Al-Akili, who was speaking on Al-Eteiah TV in Iraq.

It should be noted that 'electronic flies' is the Arabic term for 'bots,' but it seems that Al-Akili believes them to be actual flies that were released in China,"" MEMRI said.
Al-Akili's statement was: ""There are analyses that say that in 2015, there was an American delegation that came to China to take part in a military industry conference. According to these analyses, this epidemic was spread there, and according to some analyses, electronic flies [sic] were spread in that region.

""Whom does this virus serve? According to this analysis, the virus serves the USA. China's losses are estimated at $500 billion since the beginning of the crisis. This affects [China's] situation.

So this is a war against China, waged by means of this epidemic,"" he said.
""According to Chinese analyses, the United States is behind this attack, which is a part of the biological war against China. The United States has conducted experiments in this field,"" he claimed.
The plague, which has been going on for several weeks, has been centered in the area of Wuhan, China, but has spread worldwide. Its death toll to date is about 2,000, with some 75,000 infections reported.

Well, because it doesn't fit the agenda because there's a political agenda behind this. They have weaponized this, and they're doing everything they can to damage Trump.
This is no more than the continuation of Trump-Russia collusion and the meddling and all that, and then you have the Ukraine impeachment phone call.

""The point of the story is they have learned that the fatality rate is not nearly as high as they thought it was for coronavirus. That's what CNN ought to be telling people!

Doctors stunned as coronavirus leaves children virtually untouched,"Amid the spread of the coronavirus and even greater fears of the disease, age is emerging as a strong predictor of whether those who are infected with the virus will sicken or shrug it off.
""This is one of the unusual findings and curveballs that this virus keeps throwing at us,"" Dr. Frank Esper, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Cleveland Clinic Children's, told NBC News. ""Normal coronaviruses seem to affect children and adults equally, but this one, for whatever reason, certainly skews more to the adult population.""

Statistics bear that out. In Italy, which has been hit hard by the virus, the vast majority of the 79 deaths occurred in individuals between the ages of 63 and 95, according to The Guardian.
A World Health Organization report that examined cases in China found that children (age 18 and younger) were only 2.4 percent of all reported cases of the virus.
""A very small proportion of those aged under 19 years have developed severe (2.5%) or critical disease (0.2%),"" WHO added.

Dr. Vanessa Raabe, an assistant professor of pediatric and adult infectious diseases at New York University, said adult immune systems weaken with age.
""We've seen similar patterns for other diseases -- chickenpox, for example. Adults who get it tend to get much more severe cases than children,"" she told NBC.

Dr. Buddy Creech, an associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt Children's Hospital, said there are theories but no facts to explain why children are not becoming sick from the new virus
""Kids with this novel coronavirus, maybe they are responding like they would any other coronavirus, where they get a little runny nose, a little cough, or very mild symptoms, because they have seen coronavirus before, and maybe that provides them a little more protection,"" he told NBC, adding, ""We simply do not understand why kids have been spared.""
Children can still be carriers of the virus, experts said.
""The virus seems to be transmitted just fine, and it still appears that younger kids under 10 to 15 years of age simply aren't getting disease, or if they are, they're not getting too many symptoms,"" Creech said.
Esper said increased testing in the U.S. will uncover more cases, but cautioned parents against thinking their children are bulletproof.

""Right now, we unfortunately just can’t tell you exactly why kids are faring better. What's their secret to their success? We’re just happy they do have success against this particular virus,"" Esper said. ""But that doesn't mean your child or any other child is not going to get sick, and it doesn't mean they can't get infected and spread the infection to other people who can get more sick.""
Pamela Kahn, president of the California School Nurses Organization, said the lack of cases is a factor to consider as schools weigh closing to slow the spread of the disease.
""In my head and in my heart, I don't think this virus is hitting kids, but I wouldn’t be blasé and tell parents not to worry,"" Kahn told USA Today.
Esper said schools need to consider all the aspects of closing.

""Just because we haven't seen that childhood disease, doesn't mean we want to trust our luck and roll the dice with it,"" he said. ""And also, it's not just the children in the schools, but there are also adults that may be more at risk.""

Coronavirus hits China-linked nations hardest,"Wuhan, China (Pixabay)
The severe outbreaks of the coronavirus in northern Italy and Iran appear to be linked to China's implementation of its ""One Belt and One Road"" construction program, which brings Chinese workers into the host countries.
Advertisement - story continues below
The Federalist reported many nations are borrowing money from China for construction projects that are handled by Chinese companies.
""What many people find shocking is that Italy and Iran are the second- and third-hardest hit nations in this outbreak,"" the report said.
Worldwide, the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, has infected more than 200,000 people and has claimed about 8,000 lives. China leads the world with more than 81,000 cases and about 3,200 deaths.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Italy has suffered more than 35,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths, while in Iran it's almost 18,000 cases and 1,135 deaths.
The Federalist said the ""One Belt and One Road"" initiative is Beijing's ""foreign policy play disguised as infrastructure investment.""
Advertisement - story continues below
""Here's how it works: China and country X agree to do an infrastructure project in country X. Country X has to borrow from a Chinese bank to finance the project. A contract is always awarded to Chinese companies, which then bring supplies and Chinese employees to country X to build the project. Clearly, the country that benefits most from this initiative is China,"" the Federalist reported.
China's concern is it's ""geopolitical influence as well as its economic and military footing.""
Even without the coronavirus, it wasn't a good deal, the report said.
""At least eight countries that signed on the OBOR initiative are so indebted to the Chinese that they had to hand over their strategic assets to China to offset their debt. Despite these worrisome precedents, leaders in both Italy and Iran eagerly signed up to OBOR in 2019, hoping the red capital from Communist China would rescue their nations from economic woes. Now they are paying a dear price for it.""
The report explained Italy has struggled with unstable governments over the years, leaving no one with an incentive for longterm solutions. For example, just two years ago, a new government was installed, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte signed on to the agreement.

""As part of the deal, Italy opened an array of sectors to Chinese investment, from infrastructure to transportation, including letting Chinese state-owned companies hold a stake in four major Italian ports. The deal gave communist China a foothold in the heart of Europe,"" the report said.
Significantly, the regions of Lombardy and Tuscany, where much of the Chinese investment developed, now are sites of the worst coronavirus outbreaks outside China.
Iran has faced economic woes because of its adherence to a nuclear weapons program and the sanctions that were applied to stop it.
""Facing domestic economic and political challenges and international isolation, Iran has sought out China as an ally against the United States, relying on economic ties and military cooperation with Beijing to fend off U.S.-imposed sanctions,"" the report said.
Advertisement - story continues below
""China has been keeping the Iranian regime afloat by purchasing Iranian oil, selling the Iranian regime weapons, and transferring nuclear technologies.""
Iran signed onto OBOR in 2019, the report said. Now, the nation's outbreak has been traced to the region where China was building a high-speed rail line.

The guest, naturopathic Dr. Sherrill Sellman, said that Silver Solution—a product that can be purchased on Bakker's web store—has been found to be effective on viruses related to the one from Wuhan. Further, she said Silver Solution could bolster a person's immune system and potentially make their bodies less susceptible to the virus.

The governors of Ohio and Illinois announced Sunday that they will sign orders closing all bars and restaurants in their states to curb the spread of coronavirus.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that his order will close all bars and restaurants in the state indefinitely starting at 9 p.m. Sunday. Establishments will still be able to provide carry-out and delivery service to their customers, DeWine said.

“I’m aware that this will impact many, many good workers,” DeWine, a Republican, tweeted. “Every day we delay, more people will die.”
Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, a Democrat, announced on Sunday that he will also be signing an order closing all bars and restaurants to dine-in customers in his state starting at the close of business Monday.
However, unlike DeWine’s, Pritzker’s order is set to expire on March 30.
“The time for persuasion and public appeals is over,” Pritzker said. “The time for action is here. This is not a joke. No one is immune to this, and you have an obligation to act in the best interests of all people of this state.”

Both Ohio and Illinois are scheduled to hold presidential primary elections Tuesday. The top election officials in both states joined officials from Arizona and Florida, which also vote Tuesday, saying voters can “safely and securely” cast ballots since polling locations don’t produce the same level of exposure as other types of mass gatherings.
Pritzker said Sunday when announcing his restaurant closure order that he will not postpone Tuesday’s primary, saying “democracy must continue.”
“If we delayed the election, it is unclear when we might be able to hold another one,” Pritzker said.
The restaurant and bar closures in Ohio and Illinois follow the closures of schools in at least 20 states due to coronavirus.

Ohio may keep its schools closed for the remainder of the year, DeWine said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
“I have learned about talking to the experts, it’s not just one thing, [we] have to do a lot of different things and do them early,” the Ohio governor said. “And that’s what we’re trying to do in Ohio.”

Explosion in new coronavirus cases directly linked to S. Korean religious 'cult',"A mysterious religious group is at the center of an explosion of new coronavirus cases, strengthening the case that our globalized world is not ready for a large-scale outbreak.
Followers of South Korea's Shincheonji Church of Jesus make up half of the nearly 350 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country, health officials cited by The New York Times said.
Advertisement - story continues below
Now, over 1,250 members of the group -- which mainstream South Korean churches consider a cult, according to The Times -- are reporting possible symptoms of the hyper-contagious virus.
Shincheonji's website claims the church has over 300 operational centers, with a presence on every continent except Antarctica. The novel coronavirus would seemingly spread like wildfire in the church's crowded gatherings, where members usually forego masks to loudly shout hymns.
“We were not supposed to have anything on our faces, like glasses or masks. We were trained to sing our hymns loudly,"" one former member told The Times. “We were taught not to be afraid of illness.""

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

One Shencheonji follower, known as Patient No. 31, was admitted to a hospital in South Korea in early February after a car crash, The Times reported. Although she eventually developed symptoms of the virus known as COVID-19, the woman was still able to escape the hospital multiple times to attend packed church services.
The city where the patient was admitted, Daegu, was labeled a special zone after an outbreak threatened the 2.5 million residents. Eventually, a test confirmed that the mystery illness affecting Patient No. 31 was the dreaded novel coronavirus.

There's no telling where this church member was first infected, but there are reports of Shencheonji opening a center in Wuhan- ground zero of the outbreak.
According to the church's leader there is little to worry about, as he claims the prophecies of the Book of Revelation have been completed.
According to California's Orange County Register, founder Lee Man-hee says that Jesus Christ appeared to him and gifted the Shincheonji leader with unique insight into the ""end-times"" prophecies of the Bible.
Some say that Lee considers himself a prophet, and even the second coming of Jesus. Regardless of his claimed divine affiliation, there's no doubt that his followers are in grave danger.

Trump is cracking open secretive government medical stockpile to fight coronavirus,"A secretive stockpile of medical supplies is now being tapped to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The Department of Health and Human Services' ""Strategic National Stockpile is organized to support any public health threat,"" according to the emergency system's website.
Advertisement - story continues below
President Donald Trump's HHS secretary, Alex Azar, approved the emergency use authorization of the stockpile to combat COVID-19 in early February.
Personal protective gear such as respirators and diagnostic panels are two of the supplies now being pulled from the stockpile.
Thanks to consumers rushing to stores for masks and other supplies, much of the civilian market has been wiped of the valuable tools.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

The masks are essential for medical workers and first responders who will work closely with the infected over the course of the current outbreak in the United States.
Now that the stockpile has been opened, those who need masks and other gear the most should have easier access to them.
Advertisement - story continues below
The stockpile has previously been opened for pathogens such as the Zika and Ebola viruses, as well as for disasters like Hurricane Katrina and the 9/11 terror attacks.
According to a 2016 NPR report, the stockpile is divided across locations throughout America, all of which are secret. The number of warehouses is also a closely guarded secret.
""If everybody knows exactly what we have, then you know exactly what you can do to us that we can't fix,"" National Strategic Stockpile Director Greg Burel told NPR in 2016.
""And we just don't want that to happen.""
At the time, the stockpile held over $7 billion in equipment and medicines to fight threats on American soil.

Thankfully, the most serious items in the horde, including nerve agent antidotes, have gone unused.
The stockpile's most recent activation comes as part of the Trump administration's response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
The virus' spread across the globe has quickly become a pandemic, with a staggeringly high case fatality rate that makes it a much deadlier illness than the common flu.
While Trump's plan has already shut down travel from many infected countries and regions, community spread means the virus' presence in America will continue to grow.

As the United States ramps up efforts to combat the coronavirus, the stockpiles' supplies will be essential for an effective response.

Biden blasts Trump's coronavirus response from the sidelines: 'He should stop talking',"President Donald Trump's morale-boosting message to Americans that the current restrictions under which they are living will not last forever was a mistake, according to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
The former vice president on Tuesday criticized a comment Trump made that he would like to have the nation restored to largely normal activity by Easter, which is April 12.

“I’d love to have it open by Easter,” Trump said at a coronavirus town hall. “I would love to have that. It’s such an important day for other reasons, but I’ll make it an important day for this too.""
""I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter,"" he added, according to a White House media pool report.
Biden scoffed at setting Easter as a goal during an interview blitz.

""I'd like to get the economy going up tomorrow, but the idea that he's gonna move in that direction, thinks that could be done by Easter?"" Biden said in an MSNBC interview.
""That would be a real resurrection if that could happen.""

Biden also rejected an Easter deadline for a return to normal life in an interview with CNN.
""He should stop talking and start to listen to the medical experts,"" Biden said. ""You talk about having an economic crisis. You want to have an economic crisis, watch this spike, watch the number of dead go up, watch the number of people who in fact connect with this virus.
""When are you gonna be able to open up the economy? Look, we all want the economy to open as rapidly as possible. The way to do that is, let's take care of the medical side of this immediately.""

The former vice president expressed similar sentiments in his MSNBC interview.
""I would like to open up the government tomorrow if it were possible,"" Biden said, according to The Hill. ""Let’s be realistic. This curve is going up and up and up because we did not act when we should have acted.""

""Look, if you want to ruin the economy for a long time, let’s go ahead see this thing continue by having it burst out again,"" he added.
""We haven’t even flattened the curve. It’s frustrating to hear this president speak. He should stop talking. Let the experts speak.""
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, later said that Trump's goal of opening the country back up by Easter is flexible.

""But the country is a big country,"" he said, noting that in other places, the virus does not appear to have penetrated society as deeply.
Fauci earlier said in an interview with Science that the imposition of restrictions is a balancing act.
""There is a discussion and a delicate balance about what’s the overall impact of shutting everything down completely for an indefinite period of time,"" he said. ""So, there's a compromise.

One of the men seen on the store surveillance video was wearing a yellow medical mask and a homemade sign taped to his back that read, ""CAUTION I have the CORONA VIRUS.""
The suspect with the mask was seen spraying some kind of liquid on beauty products, health products, clothing and produce.
The substance was later identified to be Lysol spray. Walmart told the police that the store had to be professionally cleaned, and that tossing out the damaged produce would cost them about $7,300, while additional cleanup would cost about $2,400.

After reviewing the case with local detectives, the Will County States Attorney’s Office decided that there was enough probable cause to issue a complaint warrant for Wallace.
He turned himself in on Thursday and was subsequently arrested and booked in the Will County Jail on misdemeanor charges of criminal trespass to real property, disorderly conduct and retail theft. He appeared in court for a hearing Friday, according to the Chicago Tribune.

China is exporting far more than coronavirus,"While I love people from every country around the world, I can't say the same about their governments.
China is already in global hot water for being the petri dish in which the COVID-19 (coronavirus) spawned. But that culpability and atrocity might pale in comparison to what else the Chinese Red State is doing.
Advertisement - story continues below
The Chinese regime has been found guilty of continuing to kill tens of thousands of prisoners of faith and conscience annually and then sell their organs for profit. That was the final judgment on March 1 from an independent people's tribunal based in London, as outlined in a 160-page report, which includes an additional 300 pages of witness testimonies and submissions.
For those who didn't know about these atrocities against humanity, the report explained:
For over a decade the People's Republic of China has stood publicly accused of acts of cruelty and wickedness that match the cruelty and wickedness of medieval torturers and executioners.
If the accusations are true, then thousands of innocent people have been killed … having their bodies – the physical integrity of their beings – cut open while still alive for their kidneys, livers, hearts, lungs, cornea and skin to be removed and turned into commodities for sale.
Those innocents were killed by doctors simply because they believed, for example, in truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance and lived lives of healthy exercise and meditation and because the way they lived was seen as dangerous to the interests and objectives of the totalitarian state of the People's Republic of China.
And yet the People's Republic of China has done little to challenge the accusations except to say that they were politically motivated lies. …
If the accusations are proved, they will, inevitably, be compared to the worst atrocities committed in conflicts of the 20th century; but victim for victim and death for death, the gassing of the Jews by the Nazis, the massacre by the Khmer Rouge or the butchery to death of the Rwanda Tutsis may not be worse than cutting out the hearts, other organs and the very souls of living, blameless, harmless, peaceable people.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

The chairman of the tribunal was Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, who previously led the prosecution of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal.
According to the Epoch Times, ""Four methods of forced organ harvesting are currently known: killing prisoners by removing their organs; harvesting organs from prisoners after lethal injection; harvesting from prisoners who weren't dead after execution by shooting; and 'organ harvesting under the pretext of brain death.'""
Advertisement - story continues below
In 2015, the Chinese government said it would cease forced organ harvesting from executed prisoners and rely exclusively on a new voluntary donation system.
But just months ago, in November 2019, a study published in the scientific journal BMC Medical Ethics found that ""Beijing's reported organ donation numbers don't stack up, and there is highly compelling evidence that they are being falsified."" (The availability of organs cannot be accounted for by the number of death-row executions and voluntary organ donations.)
The reason for the discrepancy is based in the inhibition and refusal of the Chinese people to donate their organs, which was made clear last year when the University of Arizona hosted a panel on China's forced organ harvesting.
Weldon Gilcrease, M.D., deputy director of DAFOH and a director and assistant professor of oncology at the University of Utah School of Medicine, explained: ""Prior to 1999, [the] number of liver transplantations taking place in China was about 15 to 20 per year as an entire country, because there is a culture code within China that you take your body into [the] next life, so your organs must stay intact. Therefore, the donation rate is extremely low.""
After 1999, however, there was an absolute explosion in the number of organ transplants in China, Dr. Gilcrease explained.
Advertisement - story continues below
Since the early 2000s, Chinese hospitals have been providing live organs on demand. In just a few days or weeks, perfectly matched organs can ""magically be acquired."" And we aren't just talking about harvesting a few available organs; rather, there are 60,000 to 100,000 major organ transplant cases per year in China.
It was back in 2006 that former Canadian Secretary of State David Kilgour and human rights lawyer David Matas removed the Chinese veil of secrecy by uncovering evidence that Falun Gong prisoners of conscience were being murdered on demand to supply China's organ transplant industry.
In fact, there has been so much harvesting of human organs in China that it has become a major export industry, too, with even some Western countries in support, including ""Canada, among other developed countries,"" as the Epoch Times again reported.
Fortunately, most developed countries have opposed it.
Advertisement - story continues below
The European Union and the United States have condemned forced organ harvesting. And countries like Israel, Spain, Belgium, Italy, Taiwan and Norway have already enacted anti-organ trafficking legislation.
The Chinese regime's human rights abuses were just highlighted in a U.S. State Department report, including its state-sanctioned practice of killing prisoners of conscience for organ transplant surgery.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at press briefings last week and last July that China's persecution, abuse and atrocities against those who are simply expressing and practicing compassionate religious beliefs – including ""underground"" and ""expendable"" Christians, Tibetans and Muslims – is the ""stain of the century.""
""It's imprisoning religious minorities in internment camps – part of its historic antipathy to religious believers,"" Pompeo explained.
Advertisement - story continues below
He concluded, ""We pray for a day when Cubans, Venezuelans, Chinese, Iranians, and all peoples can speak and assemble freely without fear of their own governments.""
My wife, Gena, and I are grateful that a bipartisan group of U.S. senators has drafted a resolution to expose China's barbaric human rights record as the basis for the country being unfit to host the Olympic Games in 2022.
When you write or call your government representatives and President Trump about continuing to fight to free the U.S. from its dependency upon China, particularly in the areas of medicine and antibiotics, tell them to fight even more ferociously against Beijing's atrocities of forced organ harvesting and trafficking.
Whether aiding us to fight against COVID-19, sparing human life in the womb or warring against brutal regimes that torture and kill their own people for the profit of organ sales, the wisdom of Thomas Jefferson applies: ""The care of human life and happiness and not their destruction is the first and only legitimate object of good government.""

""KUOW is monitoring White House briefings for the latest news on the coronavirus — and we will continue to share all news relevant to Washington State with our listeners,"" the radio station said on Twitter.
""However, we will not be airing the briefings live due to a pattern of false or misleading information provided that cannot be fact checked in real time.""
White House spokesman Judd Deere, according to the Washington Examiner, reacted.

""It's not surprising, but also a failure of their duty to the American people, that some media outlets would choose to block their audiences from receiving accurate, up-to-date information on President Trump’s whole-of-government approach to slowing the spread of COVID-19,"" Deere said.
Meanwhile, the $2.2 trillion Senate coronavirus bill includes $75 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR, Fox News reported.

Nancy Barnes, NPR's senior vice president, told the Washington Examiner that editorial coverage decisions are ""based on the news environment in any given hour, on any given day; our decision regarding providing live coverage of the White House daily COVID-19 briefings is no different.""
""Today, we have decided to lean into our original reporting and analysis on our daily programs like 'Morning Edition' and 'All Things Considered' while offering our Member Stations a live stream of the White House briefings on a separate channel, but our coverage decisions will continue to evolve daily,"" she said.
The Examiner quoted local talk-radio host Jason Rantz of KTTH, who, like the White House, said he was not surprised by the local NPR affiliate's decision.
""Given the new polling by Gallup, perhaps they thought the president was doing too good a job? If they have complaints about false information, they could, you know, do their jobs and correct the record,"" he said.
""This is likely more driven by an angry, progressive Seattle base of listeners that complained. They're simply triggered by the president's voice, still upset they lost in 2016,"" said Rantz.

Dr. Fauci: Coronavirus death rate like very bad flu,"Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House Coronavirus Taskforce. (Official White House photo by D. Myles Cullen)
Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, co-authored an article published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine predicting the fatality rate for the coronavirus will turn out to be like that of a ""severe seasonal influenza.""
Advertisement - story continues below
In an exceptionally bad flu season, the case fatality rate is about one-tenth of 1 percent, the authors write.
Regarding the current coronavirus pandemic, they said: ""If one assumes that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases, the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%.""
Taking into account the unreported cases, they conclude ""that the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza (which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%) or a pandemic influenza (similar to those in 1957 and 1968) rather than a disease similar to SARS or MERS, which have had case fatality rates of 9 to 10% and 36%, respectively.""

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
His current assessment is a signicant downgrade from the figure he cited in testimony to the House of Representatives on March 11 in which he called for a cancellation of any large gatherings.
Advertisement - story continues below
Fauci estimated at the time – prior to the current shutdown – that the true mortality rate of the coronavirus outbreak, taking into account unreported cases, was ""somewhere around 1%, which means it is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu.""
""The seasonal flu that we deal with every year has a mortality of 0.1%,"" he explained at the hearing. ""The stated mortality, overall, of [the coronavirus], when you look at all the data including China, is about 3%.""
""We would recommend that there not be large crowds,"" Fauci told the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform at the time. ""If that means not having any people in the audience where the NBA plays, so be it. But as a public health official, anything that has large crowds is something that would give a risk to spread.""
As WND reported Thursday, the lead author of a dire coronavirus study cited by the White House, Downing Street and other governments in their decisions implement unprecendented ""social distancing"" measures has drastically revised the estimated death toll of the pandemic in the U.K.
The study by Imperial College of London published March 16 estimated that 2.2 million Americans and 500,000 Britons could die. But lead author Neil Ferguson testified Wednesday to a parliamentary committee that the U.K. death toll is unlikely to exceed 20,000 and could be much lower. And more than half that number would have died anyway by the end of the year, because of their age and underlying illnesses, he told the panel.
Advertisement - story continues below
An average of about 29,000 in the U.K. die every year of the flu and related complications.
At the White House Coronavirus Task Force daily briefing Thursday, coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx mentioned Ferguson's dramatic downgrade of his estimate.
She said the predictions of models also ""don't match the reality on the ground in either China, South Korea or Italy.""
""Models are models. There's enough data now of the real experience with the coronavirus on the ground, really, to make these predictions much more sound,"" said Birx.
Advertisement - story continues below
""So when people start talking about 20% of a population getting infected, it's very scary,"" she said. ""But we don't have data that matches that.""
Ferguson clarifies
Ferguson issued a clarification Thursday via Twitter, arguing his evidence to Parliament ""referred to the deaths we assess might occur in the UK in the presence of the very intensive social distancing and other public health interventions now in place.""
""Without those controls, our assessment remains that the UK would see the scale of deaths reported in our study (namely, up to approximately 500 thousand),"" he wrote.
Advertisement - story continues below
However, no one in the U.S. or the U.K. was advocating at the time that no measures be taken to control the spread of the virus, points out Powerline blogger Paul Mirengoff.
""Some degree of social distancing and complete isolation of the sick were almost universally viewed as appropriate and, indeed, necessary,"" he wrote.
""Yet, Ferguson's projection became part of the basis, not just for social distancing and isolation of the sick, but for imposing lockdown style measures in some jurisdictions.""
And Ferguson acknowledged in an interview with the New York Times that a comprehensive lockdown is what he wanted.
Advertisement - story continues below
""Based on our estimates and other teams', there's really no option but follow in China's footsteps and suppress,"" he said.
Mirengoff commented: ""Perhaps this is why Ferguson waited so long to make it clear that, at least in the U.S., the Imperial College forecast that garnered so much attention from policy makers was a strawman.""
In fact, New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is managing the country's most severe outbreak, is questioning the comprehensive lockdown strategy.
""We closed everything down. That was our public health strategy,"" Cuomo said Thursday. ""If you re-thought that or had time to analyze that public health strategy, I don't know that you would say, 'Quarantine everyone.'""

On Wednesday, he said the shelter-in-place policy may be backfiring by confining vulnerable older people with younger family members.
""I don't even know that that was the best public health policy. Young people then quarantined with older people, [it] was probably not the best public health strategy,"" he said. ""The younger people could have been exposing the older people to an infection.""
On Thursday, forecasters at the University of Washington's School of Medicine released a study Thursday estimating COVID-19 could lead to more than 80,000 deaths in the U.S. by early April under the current lockdown conditions.
In 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated 80,000 Americans died of flu and its complications during the previous winter, the highest death toll in at least four decades.

Daily Caller News Foundation
Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), could not definitively rule out the theory that the coronavirus was created in a laboratory.
Cuccinelli, who serves as a top member on the Trump administration’s coronavirus task force, said Monday that the origins of the novel virus remain unknown, and while its characteristics suggest it isn’t man-made, he could not completely reject the theory that it was created in a laboratory in China’s Hubei province.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

“Our colleagues at CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and NIH [National Institutes of Health] on the task force have made it very clear [that] we don’t yet know the origin of this particular virus,” Cuccinelli told Fox News medical correspondent Dr. Marc Siegel on “Tucker Carlson Tonight.”
“We are not entirely sure how this one started yet,” Cuccinelli continued. “There is a biological facility in the Hubei province that people worry about. But I will say the reading that I have done of medical professionals suggest that the structure of the virus seems unlikely to have been man-made because if it was made to be a threat, you would expect to see certain characteristics that aren’t present.”

“Does that mean it rules it out? No, not absolutely,” he said.
The coronavirus outbreak began in late 2019 in Wuhan, the capital city of China’s Hubei province. Since then, it has spread to most every corner of the globe. There are now more than 77,600 confirmed cases and 2,663 deaths in China from the novel virus, according to NBC News. The White House is seeking $2.5 billion in emergency funds to fight the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization, however, has yet to deem the virus as a pandemic.
The coronavirus has killed more people than SARS, another deadly virus that originated in China. Fears of a global pandemic caused the stock market to plunge, with the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all falling when the markets opened Monday morning.

The president's dangerous coronavirus position,"It's rare that President Donald Trump ever seems to misread a communications matter. From the earliest 2016 debates, it became clear that he is a lot better at communicating with the American people than your standard-issue Republican politician.
He's also a master at the media game. The liberal press would never admit it, but he's the best political communicator of our time. That's why his treatment of the new coronavirus is so surprising.
Advertisement - story continues below
Trump has been his usual confident self when it comes to coronavirus. His primary talking points have been twofold: The federal government is doing an amazing job, and the virus may not be as dangerous as people think. The president's confidence is usually a strength. People want that in a leader. But with coronavirus, there are a couple of problems with Trump's messaging.
First, it's a disease that we can only control marginally. We can take steps to minimize the impact, speed up vaccine research and prepare our health-care system, but we can't fundamentally control the disease, and we don't really know how it will turn out.
We can't control things like how the disease reacts to warmer weather or how it evolves. Reassurance is good, but sending a message that everything is going to be fine is dangerous when you don't have all the facts.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Second, our government is horrible at large-scale operations for catastrophic scenarios. As we have seen after natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina, delivering aid and services on a large scale is not a strength of the federal government. Our military leaders are great at operations, but, for sound legal and policy reasons, they are averse to using troops for civilian operations on U.S. soil.
The rest of the federal government is tough to manage. We have already seen federal government failures on coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent a lot of time developing a coronavirus test kit that did not work properly. The State Department, over objections from the CDC, flew 14 cruise ship passengers infected with coronavirus back to the U.S. on a plane with uninfected passengers on board. There have been complaints that the Department of Health and Human Services sent employees to meet infected patients returning to the U.S. from China without proper protective equipment or training.
Advertisement - story continues below
In response to some of these early problems, Trump has appointed Vice President Mike Pence to oversee our coronavirus response. This should help, but it also adds further political danger for the president. If the response suffers from further problems, the problems are now sitting right in the vice president's office.
Generally, operations such as these are handled at Cabinet agencies, which have the manpower and expertise to adequately address the problem. The vice president and his tiny staff can be easily overwhelmed by the needs of this effort. And if there are management problems, it would be tough politically for Trump to swap out his own vice president as the leader of the effort.
If the coronavirus hits our shores on a limited basis and blows over without too much damage to our livelihood or our economy, everything will be fine. The president will look like a genius. If it doesn't, or if we witness major inadequacies – real or perceived – in the federal government's response, the president may have a big political problem in an election year.
If this crisis proves serious, will our polarized country manage to come together over a large-scale disaster? Sadly, this does not seem likely based on what we've seen so far.
The president's political opponents and their allies in the press are geared up to blame him for anything and everything they can. At a recent political rally, Trump described his opponents' efforts to politically smear him for coronavirus as just the latest in a series of political hoaxes attempted against him.
Advertisement - story continues below
In a sign of how polarized we have become, some Democrats and some in the press accused the president of saying the virus itself was a hoax. Any fair reading of Trump's comments shows this is preposterous. And the president's actions to date – travel restrictions, quarantines, emergency spending requests and the appointment of his own vice president to lead the response – establish how seriously he's treating the virus.
The scuffle over his words, however, proves just how potentially perilous this issue is for the president in an election year.
Given the situation, the best course for the president is to show the American people he is treating the coronavirus with the utmost seriousness and managing our massive government to minimize the scope of the outbreak.
But telling Americans that our government is performing amazingly well and everything will be fine seems reckless. The chance that this factors into the presidential election seems pretty high.

"When Don Lemon loses it over Trump's coronavirus speech, John Kashich has to set him straight","When even John Kasich is defending President Donald Trump, it’s clear Don Lemon has lost it.
During a CNN interview after Trump’s address to the nation about the coronavirus Wednesday night, the former Ohio governor infuriated Lemon by pronouncing Trump’s speech “fine” – and saying it was exactly what Trump needed to do at this point in the crisis.

And that, of course, is exactly what Lemon and his anti-Trump network did not want to hear. Sounding like a petulant teenager more than a highly paid television anchor, Lemon let his feelings show.

""We need straight, accurate information from this president and this administration. And we’re not getting it,"" Lemon whined irrationally. “And I don’t understand why you are tiptoeing around it! He came out. Gave an address. That happens very rarely. And he doesn’t get it right?”
What apparently set Lemon off was a clarification Trump published shortly after his speech to make it clear that while he appeared to have announced that a ban on travel from Europe to the United States would cover both humans and trade goods, it would actually only apply to passenger traffic.
Advertisement - story continues below
“The restriction stops people not goods,” Trump wrote.
Hoping to get the payroll tax cut approved by both Republicans and Democrats, and please remember, very important for all countries & businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2020

To Lemon, an anti-Trump zealot bent on using his national platform as a megaphone to attack the president, that was apparently unforgivable.
But to Kasich, a veteran of politics who spent 18 years in Congress before serving two terms as governor of Ohio and mounting an unsuccessful run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, that kind of clarification was routine.
Advertisement - story continues below

“It isn’t unusual for somebody in a speech to clarify something, OK?” he told Lemon. “But I don’t think the tone he showed tonight takes away from some clarification. I think he set a serious tone. That’s what I wanted out of him for a long time, and I think we got it.” (Check out the complete video at the Washington Examiner.)
On social media, Lemon had his defenders, of course. No liberal would miss a chance to bash Trump, and the coronavirus outbreak is the weapon of the day.
But many, many commenters agreed with Kasich’s point -- and Lemon didn’t come out well at all.

That last question -- “Since Don Lemon is the interviewer shouldn’t he be letting Kasich talk?” -- gets to the heart of the matter.
For Lemon and his fellow hyper partisans in the mainstream media, the coronavirus outbreak isn’t just a news story worthy of coverage, it’s yet another cudgel to be used to beat the president.
Advertisement - story continues below
When Kasich refused to go along, Lemon simply lost it.
It’s important to remember that Kasich has been one of Trump’s most consistent critics since the nomination fight in 2016 and even called for his impeachment last fall.
The fact that a veteran congressman and former governor was actually praising the president should be a sign that even some of Trump’s political foes are acknowledging his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
For Trump’s enemies in the media -- and Lemon is only one of the most obvious -- that’s simply inconceivable.

Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler will all be shutting down their U.S.-based factories this week, according to CNBC. The closures will last through March 30, at least.

Honda is closing four of its U.S. plants as of Monday for six days.
“GM and the [United Auto Workers union] have always put the health and safety of the people entering GM plants first,” GM CEO Mary Barra said in a statement, according to the Detroit Free Press. “We have been taking extraordinary precautions around the world to keep our plant environments safe and recent developments in North America make it clear this is the right thing to do now.”
“We’re continuing to work closely with union leaders, especially the United Auto Workers, to find ways to help keep our workforce healthy and safe -- even as we look at solutions for continuing to provide the vehicles customers really want and need,” Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford North America, said.

Ford also said it would put additional steps in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus.
The automaker closed one Michigan-based assembly plant after an employee tested positive for the virus.

Ford said workers with a year of service or more will earn 75 percent of their wages through a combination of payments from the company and unemployment benefits, according to The New York Times.
“UAW members, their families and our communities will benefit from today’s announcement with the certainty that we are doing all that we can to protect our health and safety during this pandemic,” UAW President Rory Gamble said.
“This will give us time to review best practices and to prevent the spread of this disease.”
RBC Capital Markets said global auto production could drop 16 percent in 2020, with U.S. sales expected to fall 20 percent.
“The greater challenge is that once the country gets past the worst of the pandemic, automakers will need to be prepared to get back online quickly to capitalize on the wave of deferred consumer demand,” Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ executive director of industry analysis, told CNBC.

Collectively, the actions will shutter 25 factories and affect 150,000 union workers.
James Hudson, a Fiat Chrysler pipefitter, said the action was the right step.
“The air in here has been eerie. You could feel it when come into the plant. Nobody’s talking even on their breaks, they’re sitting at tables by themselves. You can tell there’s a lot of anxiety,” he told the Free Press. “I think the Big Three could’ve done this before now. It’s easy to say we’re looking out for our people but another thing to show it.""
Hudson said in a plant where there were 1,700 or 1,800 people on each shift, it was like working in ""a big city.""

""For those of us taking things seriously, I feel like we’re being put in harm’s way,"" he said.

The action reflects the drop in consumer demand for vehicles at a time when battling the virus is sending ripples through the economy.
“We had four customers cancel deliveries because of the virus,” Wes Lutz, an auto dealer who owns Extreme Dodge in Jackson, Michigan, told The Times.

Senate coronavirus bill includes Pelosi-pushed $25 million for Kennedy Arts Center,"The Senate version of the bill to help a nation coping with unprecedented turmoil due to the coronavirus includes $25 million to renovate the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., as part of a massive infusion of taxpayer cash into arts funding.
The House bill crafted by Speaker Nancy Pelosi initially sought $35 million for the center.

The funding would provide ""deep cleaning, increased teleworking capabilities, and operating and administrative expenses to ensure the Center will resume normal operations immediately upon reopening, according to a summary of the bill.
The money for the Kennedy Center compares favorably with that allocated to the Armed Forces Retirement Homes in Washington, D.C., and Gulfport, Mississippi, which will receive $2.8 million for ""increased healthcare, security, and food services personnel expenses, as well as necessary supplies and equipment.""
Many on social media thought the Kennedy Center funding was wrong.

James Woods helps Southern woman go viral with hilariously fed-up coronavirus rant,"If a little bit of sassy, Southern humor is balm for the soul in these uncertain times, then Emily Annette's viral video is just what the doctor ordered.
Annette, who describes herself on Twitter as a ""Southern nurse: Just touch your face"" (we'll get to that), hilariously recounts an incident she had at the checkout in a supermarket that puts the fevered hysteria over COVID-19 in proper perspective.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Annette's story is a familiar one all over America, and her take brings some levity to the seriousness of COVID-19, the sometimes deadly virus that has caused a global pandemic and resulted in unprecedented closures of schools, businesses and institutions to stop its spread.
In her video, Annette is seated in her car and sets the scene: ""I just left the grocery store and as we all know coronavirus, COVID-19, whatever we're calling it this week, has driven people completely insane,"" she says in her southern drawl.
Advertisement - story continues below
Apparently, the cashier touched his face and the woman whose groceries he was checking out ""just starts shrieking at the poor little guy ringing her up, that he has just touched his face and that he therefore must wash his hands,"" Annette says.
""I'm assuming she, surely to God, must be the head of the CDC because she says it with such conviction,"" Annette quips.
The cashier instead uses hand sanitizer and Annette goes on an amusing rant about his halfhearted effort.
""He takes like a quarter of a little squirt, does his little thing on his hands for about a quarter of a second, which basically would've just served to incite a riot and maybe kill off two small, weak germs, to which the head of the CDC in her kitten-covered lab coat nods and fervently agrees that he's, you know, saved the universe with that,"" she says, furrowing her brow in mock seriousness.
Annette goes in for the comedic kill about what the lady does next, as ""she goes on to whip out her credit card and use the debit pad that every finger-licking, booger-picking, double-digit IQ idiot has touched all day long after going to the bathroom and not washing their hands.""
Advertisement - story continues below
""And then she just walks on out with her groceries, completely oblivious to the fact that everyone who handled those groceries prior to her getting them has left their little touch and trace of germs all over them, that going down the conveyer belt they probably picked up chicken juice and everything else,"" she points out.
""But thank God that kid used that quarter of a squirt of Purell. She has saved the day and kept us all safe from the coronavirus.""
What Annette does so well is what all great comedy does -- she exposes the absurdity and hypocrisy of certain sanctimonious crusaders who miss the big picture.
Hand washing, not touching your face, and using hand sanitizer are all good advice in the fight against the spread of the coronavirus. It is the duty of everyone to protect the vulnerable population, including the elderly and immunocompromised, by following basic recommendations.
Advertisement - story continues below
However, finger-wagging at the cashier while ignoring other smart practices is less about hygiene and more about performing rituals for their own sake.
This woman who chided the cashier was caught up in her own panic and couldn't contextualize the broader application of those recommendations. Instead, she simply focused on the face-touching, hand-washing connection as some sort of protective ritual.
Coronavirus or not, it's important to remain kind and patient with one another, since we humans will have to inhabit this planet together long after the panic has passed and hand sanitizer and toilet paper are back on store shelves.
To close her entertaining story, Annette shared her Southern wisdom with this poignant message.

""Y'all, it doesn't matter what we do. There's so many stupid people in this world we're never going to survive anyway. So touch your face, just touch it,"" she says. ""It's all that's left.""

During the interview, the surgeon general noted that Americans who want to be tested for the virus will be able to be tested due to an increased supply of kits making their way around the country.
He also noted that although the virus is spreading, deaths are largely confined to older individuals with compromised health.
""Facts over fear, Jake,"" he said as the interview ended.

Coronavirus panic is 'Russian collusion!' 2.0,"Amidst the frenzy surrounding the fear of coronavirus, you may have the strange impression you have seen this movie before.
As universities cancel classes, sporting events are canceled or closed to spectators, companies tell workers to stay home, shoppers mob stores to stock up on items and governments at every level take drastic measures claimed to prevent the spread of the virus, something important is missing: Facts.

""COVID-19"" (shorthand for coronavirus disease 2019) is a strain of coronavirus, a known infectious disease. While the number of Americans having died from complications brought on by COVID-19 is extremely small, the total number of the population infected with the virus is unknown. Without testing to determine a statistical approximation of the number of people with the virus, any guesses about the mortality rate, recovery rate or level of infection is speculation.
The Great Coronavirus Panic of 2020 is being breathlessly stoked by Democrats and major media. They are using the panic they themselves induce to attack President Trump, claiming he has failed to adequately address the disease. Where the president has acted, those measures are criticized by Democrats and the media. His request for money was criticized as too little and his travel bans are prompting liberal outrage as xenophobic and too extreme. The left has positioned themselves to collect political dividends no matter what happens with the coronavirus. If the virus becomes a major public health disaster, Democrats can attack the president as incompetent and play see-I-told-you-so. If it amounts to nothing, as many believe it will, Democrats will claim credit for forcing the president to act. In any event, the circumstances are being pushed with few facts to support the draconian measures being taken.
Even before President Trump was inaugurated, Democrats and the media began a steady drumbeat of accusations of ""Russian collusion."" Liberals increased the pressure until Washington was in a frenzy, the attorney general of the United States recused himself under withering criticism from Democrats, a special counsel and a team of attorneys was assembled, and Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill began announcing their retirements en masse on the expectation President Trump would be prosecuted and driven out of office. Journalists and commentators on broadcast and cable news shows, in newspapers and on social media spent more than two years predicting the imminent indictment of the president. Many gleefully discussed the commander in chief being perp-walked out of the White House and possibly jailed. Anonymous sources were constantly quoted, and journalists made predictions based on ""bombshell"" reports from unnamed sources close to the investigation. In the middle of this tempest, the most important part was missing: Facts.

After spending millions of dollars and two years investigating every rumor and every possibility that Donald Trump somehow colluded with Russia, the Mueller investigation ended with a whimper. The Mueller report, along with his House testimony, contained none of the crimes Democrats and media had promised and hyped around the clock for years. At the end of the day, the entire Russian collusion panic was all bluster and no facts.
Just as with the Russian collusion hoax, the level of hyperbole and hysteria surrounding the coronavirus panic is masking a lack of specific details that should give pause to those leading the organizations, universities, companies and governments shutting down activity. And it is impossible not to notice those advocating the loudest for the most extreme measures at every level of society have been the most vocal critics of the president. Just as with the legend of Russian collusion, liberal political professionals and members of the media gleefully parse and predict the bounty to be gained by Democrats and the political damage to President Trump as a result of coronavirus and its impact on the economy.

A friend noted on a walk through his town this week that bars and restaurants are all as crowded as ever. He remarked that it seemed like there are two completely different worlds. In one world everything is, more or less, normal, and people are going about their lives. In the world portrayed in the media, our leaders are racing to podiums to make drastic announcements about extreme measures to stop a disease which, so far, kills about the same number of Americans as lightning strikes. In our hyper-charged, late-breaking, 24-hour news cycle, it is obviously too much to ask for major media not to stoke panic for political gain. But we should expect our leaders to be level-headed and make rational decisions based on facts and not allow themselves to be swept up in mass hysteria just because everyone else is doing it.

""The country has the largest outbreak of the virus in the Middle East, with many high-ranking officials contracting it because of the country's lack of access to medical supplies. After the death of Mohammad Mirmohammadi, a member of Iran’s Expediency Council, in early March, the Iranian government blocked the nation's access to Wikipedia to prevent unrest. At least 12 members of the Iranian regime have died from the coronavirus,"" the report said.
Other countries where religious rights are being restricted in response to the outbreak include South Korea, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Georgia, the United Arab Emirates and Tajikistan.
In Takijistan, an Islamic fatwa called on clergy to shut down mosques and cancel holiday events.

In the Republic of Georgia, a church used a shared spoon for communion rituals, giving public health officials concern.
In the UAE, officials suspended children's Bible classes and banned children from all other church activities. Lectures and sermons also were forbidden.
In Saudi Arabia, foreigners were banned from traveling to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina because of infections there.
In Italy, hit hard by the virus, entire regions were quarantined and religious services suspended.

""Although some government measures appeared to be driven by legitimate public health concerns, others appeared to exaggerate the church’s role in the outbreak,"" USCIRF said. ""The government of Seoul locked down Shincheonji churches in the capital, and some mainline Protestant groups have accused the church of deliberately spreading the disease.""
The report said there are several international accords that protect religious rights, including some that ""use similar language in providing robust protections to FoRB, and in defining the circumstances under which states may lawfully limit it in furtherance of an identified state interest, including public health.""

Players furious after coronavirus mars March Madness,"Ivy League basketball players are upset after the league announced it has canceled its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments, which were scheduled for this coming weekend, citing fears about the coronavirus.
“With the health of students as well as the campus and the general community in mind, the Ivy League Presidents have decided to cancel the upcoming Ivy League Men’s and Women’s Basketball Tournaments,” the league announced on its website Tuesday.

“We understand and share the disappointment with student-athletes, coaches and fans who will not be able to participate in these tournaments,” Ivy League Executive Director Robin Harris said.
“Regrettably, the information and recommendations presented to us from public health authorities and medical professionals have convinced us that this is the most prudent decision,” Harris added.
As a result, the league said that its “regular-season champions, Princeton women and Yale men, are the automatic qualifiers to the NCAA Tournaments.”

The means that the Yale men's team is going to the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, with Harvard not even having a chance to make its case that it should represent the league in the Big Dance.
This is particularity significant because the Harvard Crimson sit just one loss behind the Yale Bulldogs in league play.

On Saturday, Harvard bludgeoned Yale on the court by a score of 83-69, according to ESPN.
The Crimson went 2-0 against Yale on the season and will end the 2019-2020 season with a league record of 10-4. Yale, meanwhile, ends its season with a league record of 11-3.
Harvard players are understandably upset that the bid has been handed to Yale, and it's easy to understand that frustration.
Crimson guard Bryce Aiken shared his disappointment on Twitter:
Horrible, horrible, horrible decision and total disregard for the players and teams that have put their hearts into this season. This is wrong on so many levels and the @IvyLeague should do its due diligence to find a better solution. Everyone knows the risks of playing! https://t.co/HQXprzX9q6

So did Seth Towns, a senior who played for Harvard in 2016-17 and 2017-18 before injuries derailed his college career. (Towns is still listed on the men's basketball roster, though he'll graduate in May before likely playing for another school next season as a graduate transfer.)

""The hypocrisy of our Ivy League presidents is baffling and alarming. We are disappointed and disheartened that they would discriminate against one sport and allow the others to continue to compete,"" reads the petition, which had more than 4,000 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon.

""We feel the decision to cancel the tournament was made without enough serious consideration for the student athletes and the investments that have been made up to this point in our season. ""
Harvard, for its part, may very have once again defeated the Bulldogs and taken the league’s NCAA tournament bid.
Nobody will ever know what could have happened from there.
USA Today columnist Dan Wolken shared a statement from the NCAA about the coronavirus and league tournaments on Twitter:

It seems a bit reactionary for the Ivy League to cancel the entire basketball tournament when there were other alternatives, such as playing the games with no fans present.

But people are concerned about the spread of the coronavirus, and there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding how it will affect those infected.
The BBC reported Tuesday that all sports activities in Italy have been suspended until at least April 3.
Other professional sports leagues in areas hit hard by the virus have decided to play their games with no fans in the stands, according to The Associated Press.
Thus far, those who have succumbed to the virus have generally been elderly people with pre-existing health conditions, and not healthy young people, such as physically conditioned athletes.

""All of this could have been prevented if the Chinese government had merely exercised its responsibility in containing this disease and sharing more information sooner.""

The letter points to efforts by China to blame the United States for the outbreak. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian suggested the U.S. military brought the epidemic to Wuhan.

China cracks down on free speech after news of coronavirus leaks,"China's online censors began scrubbing social media and shutting down messaging groups after an uncharacteristic period of online freedom in January.
Online discussions about the coronavirus and criticisms of local authorities' handling of the crisis seemed to be unimpeded from Jan. 19 - Feb. 1, Reuters reported.

This past week, however, the Cyberspace Administration of China began to crack down on the period of liberation by shutting down WeChat groups and taking down social media posts, according to Chinese reporters.
Tech firms that refused to monitor online speech were also reprimanded.
“Xi Jinping has made it clear that he expects efforts to strengthen ‘the guidance of public opinion’ to be increased,” Fergus Ryan, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said.

“We’ve already seen around 300 more journalists dispatched to Wuhan and surrounding areas to report on the outbreak. It’s highly likely their brief is to paint a rosier picture of the government’s relief efforts rather than engage in any muckraking or critical reporting.”
Chinese President Xi Jinping has bolstered online censorship efforts in China, but questions of transparency around the coronavirus have created suspicion and mistrust.

This became evident after the passing of Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor who was allegedly detained in China for trying to warn his fellow medics about the coronavirus outbreak and later died from the virus itself.
According to a notice sent to an online Chinese news outlet, seen by Reuters, editors were told they could report on Li's death, but should ""let the topic gradually die out from the hot search list, and guard against harmful information.""
Li was an ophthalmologist at Wuhan Central Hospital who sent out a warning about the coronavirus to his colleagues on Dec. 30, according to the BBC.
Li had observed seven cases of a virus that looked like SARS, and he cautioned his fellow doctors to wear protective clothing to avoid possible infection.
The Public Security Bureau summoned Li four days later and forced him to sign a letter saying that he was “making false comments.” Seven other people were investigated as well for “spreading rumors.”

Authorities later apologized to the doctor for their actions.
During January's period of online liberation, people heavily criticized the officials in Wuhan for reprimanding Li and the other people accused of ""spreading rumors.""
The CAC announced last week that is has punished websites and social media accounts for publishing commentary on the outbreak and asked platforms to control ""harmful information"" related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Chen Qiushi, a Chinese citizen journalist who had been reporting on the outbreak over Twitter, also disappeared last week, according to The Associated Press.

To honor a terrorist.
The president of the Palestinian Authority and the Fatah movement, Mahmoud Abba, organized the ""celebration"" that drew thousands of Palestinians to honor a terrorist released from prison, according to the Israel-based watchdog Palestinian Media Watch.
""Fatah's message to its own people is that honoring a terrorist involved in the murder of six Israelis takes priority over their own health,"" PMW said.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

The Palestinian Authority has recommended against gathering in large crowds.
The gathering was for Nidal Turkeman, who took part in a number of terror attacks, including the 2002 shooting and hand grenade attack against a Likud primaries polling station in which six people were murdered. 
Advertisement - story continues below
Turkeman was released Tuesday after serving 17 years in prison.
WAFA, the official PA news agency, said: ""[PA] Government Spokesman Ibrahim Melhem said today that the msas reception that was held yesterday in Jenin for a prisoner [Nidal Naghnaghiya Turkeman] (i.e., involved in the murder of at least 6) who was released from the occupation's prison is 'an unfortunate thing, and a violation of the precautionary and defensive measures taken by the [PA] government to protect our people from the spread of the coronavirus.' ... He continued: 'We expect our people in all of the districts to change the culture of receptions, joy, and celebrations in honor of our sons returning from the prison cells. Our heroic prisoners are the first to carefully implement the law, and the last who who think to violate the order and precautionary and defensive measures, because they are a role-model of commitment and discipline.""
The report said Safa, an independent Palestinian news agency, also was critical of the mass gathering, stating, ""A mass rally in honor of a prisoners breaks the quarantine.""
It noted the ""participation of thousands of citizens.""
The PMW report said: ""Ironically, the Palestinian Authority – also headed by Mahmoud Abbas – used this opportunity to praise terrorist prisoners as ideal law-abiding citizens, saying, 'Our heroic prisoners are the first to carefully implement the law.' Palestinian Media Watch has exposed that the PA tells their people that killing Israelis is protected behavior under international law.""

Kim's company, which has been responsible this past decade for speedy turnarounds on vaccines for both the MERS virus -- a coronavirus strain he referred to as being ""in the same family as COVID-19"" -- and the more recent Zika virus outbreak, is looking to dramatically reduce its typical research, development and production time in response to the world's latest emerging public health threat.

Experts at the World Health Organization have been working, however, to stop the spread of stigma or panic surrounding the virus, reminding the international community that a recent broadening of the definition of a confirmed coronavirus case is in part to blame for the rapid increase in reported diagnoses this week.
Regardless, there is no question the societal shock waves of this viral outbreak are reverberating violently in China, where the vast majority of cases have been reported.
In Wuhan and other cities in the Chinese province of Hubei, home to nearly 60 million people, public transportation has been shuttered and mass quarantines are being enforced.

Hundreds of miles away from Wuhan, 30 million more Chinese citizens have been put in government-mandated lockdowns, The Washington Post reported.
And caught in the grips of mass panic, the rest of the nation, from rural and suburban communities to the bustling commercial centers in Beijing and Shanghai, have all but shut down, according to The New York Times, as efforts to stop the virus' spread take a turn for the industrial -- if not the tyrannical.
The worst of those efforts has even been caught on video, with the U.K. Daily Mail and social media users on the ground reporting hazmat-clad officials have begun clubbing stray animals to death in broad daylight and forcibly arresting suspected patients in their homes.

Unfortunately, it seems such is life in the People's Republic of China.
While struggling to introduce free market health care alternatives since moving away from an entirely communist system in 1984, China still covered roughly 95 percent of its citizens under a basic public health plan in 2017, according to The BMJ, a peer-reviewed medical journal.
And from several dangerous strains of the Avian influenza to SARS to COVID-19, the sprawling communist nation has a very real and very recent history when it comes to zoonotic infectious diseases -- outbreaks that the Chinese Communist Party has proven time and again to be either unfit or unprepared to deal with.
Yet, the allure of candidates who advocate for the adoption of similar socialized health care systems here in the U.S. is statistically increasing.

The two new cases were referred to Friday in a Washington State Department of Health news release as ""presumptive positives,"" confirmed by local health public health laboratories but pending further evaluation from the Centers for Disease Control, emerging in a middle-aged woman and a Snohomish County child.
Currently at home in isolation, the 50-year-old infected woman, a King County resident, is believed to have traveled to Daegu, South Korea, recently -- where confirmed coronavirus cases spiked by a dramatic 813 cases this week, according to The Guardian.
No travel confirmations have been made, however, in the case of the Snohomish County boy, leading local health officials to consider the possibility he may have been infected by community spread.
Dangerous and untraceable, community spread occurs when individuals begin contracting a virus despite not having traveled to regions where the disease is common or come into contact with individuals believed to be carrying the disease.
Confirmed cases of coronavirus are still in the double digits stateside, CBS News reported, but a Wednesday announcement from the CDC that first cases of potential community spread had been discovered in California served to exacerbate panic surrounding coronavirus within the U.S.

According to The New York Times, recent remarks from agency officials also betrayed the sentiments of some federal health officials who feel a wider outbreak within the U.S. is only a matter of time.
""It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters Tuesday.
""We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare, in the expectation that this could be bad,"" Messonnier added.
Following a sizable spike this past week, global coronavirus cases are currently estimated as exceeding 83,000, leading the World Health Organization to declare the disease a public health emergency of international concern, according to CNN.

Italy set to quarantine whole of Lombardy due to coronavirus,"(LONDON GUARDIAN) The Italian government is to lockdown the northern region of Lombardy, as it battles to contain the spread of the coronavirus. A draft decree would extend the quarantined areas, so-called “red-zones”, ordering people not to enter or leave the region.

The country is grappling to contain Europe’s worst outbreak of Covid-19, which has claimed 233 lives and infected a total of 5,883 people.

Italian authorities announced that a new decree containing draconian measures would be approved later on Saturday. It will include the power to impose fines on anyone caught entering or leaving Lombardy, the worst-affected region, until 3 April. People may be allowed in and out for serious reasons. The decree provides for banning all public events, closing cinemas, theatres, gyms, discos and pubs. Religious ceremonies such as funerals and weddings will also be banned.

Leading doctor on COVID responses: From the sensible to the absurd,"Note: Dr. Orient is executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, AAPS.
Draconian directives by some state and municipal authorities are so absurd that one wonders: Do the officials have a clue, or is something else going on?

The craziest things I have heard: Closing an entire shopping mall because a presumptively infected person walked through it, and forbidding people to go outside – the least likely place to catch an airborne infection.
Lockdowns: Well-intentioned actions can have unintended consequences. Kicking college students out of their dorms and sending them home – after they have already been infected – sends the virus from a group of young people who tolerate it well to the homes of older people with pre-existing conditions. An extensive lockdown that creates unemployment will force people into more crowded conditions. Restricting movement keeps people from seeking safety or items that fill their needs. Treating everybody like a Typhoid Mary keeps people from helping each other. Does it stop the virus? It may have already spread to half the population, who never got visibly sick or who recovered. Since we aren't testing for antibodies, we don't know. Only 3 to 4 percent of symptomatic persons presenting themselves for testing in South Korea were shown to be positive for virus in nasal secretions.
If we might die because we carried a COVID-19 virus particle into our home on our shoes, or picked one up on the handle of a gasoline pump (along with a gazillion other viruses and bacteria), we are all surely doomed. The most extreme obsessive-compulsive hand-washing or bathroom-scrubbing rituals could not save us. If we could sterilize the environment, never mind the gazillion microorganisms that peacefully coexist in our bodies, our immune system would atrophy, and we'd die like the Martian invaders in ""The War of the Worlds"" by H.G. Wells.

We need to sensibly protect the vulnerable (and the state of vulnerability is not triggered by our 60th birthday), keep our germs to ourselves when sick and practice universal good hygiene. But destroying the economy will also destroy our health.
Easing regulations: The federal government has decided that if you have a choice between a federally certified and approved medical device or death, because such a device is unobtainable, you may improvise – without fear of crippling fines or incarceration in a crowded, unsanitary jail. Auto manufacturers can make ventilators; individuals with a 3D printer can make missing parts; people can modify a ventilator to serve more than one patient; an underwear or pillow factory can make masks; and medical staff can disinfect and re-use protective gear they would otherwise throw out.

Also, some jurisdictions are forbidding instead of requiring those filthy reusable shopping bags, and coffee establishments are using only disposable cups.
Might greater freedom and common sense and cleanliness emerge from the crisis?
Preventing and treating the illness: There are NO FDA-approved preventive or therapeutic COVID-19 treatments. So, along with social-media giants, mainstream media and some political authorities, FDA is trying to squelch reports of ""fraudulent"" cures. But ""unproved"" or ""unapproved"" does not mean ""ineffective"" or ""falsified."" If FDA standards had been in effect in 1747, British seamen would have continued to die of scurvy. Instead, the navy used a study that consisted of two ""anecdotes"" of patients getting well when given lemon juice, while all 12 who got something else died.
Now we have ""anecdotes"" of COVID-19 patients getting well after being given an old antimalarial drug, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. We also have reports of failures in seriously sick patients. This would not be surprising – the drug may inhibit penetration of the virus but not help once it is proliferating inside cells, and an over-exuberant immune reaction is damaging the lungs. President Trump has called on drug companies to ramp up production to meet the shortage. Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak, who built a communications business, has ordered a ban on out-patient prescriptions for COVID-19. Some pharmacy boards and other authorities are restricting doctors' prescribing, although it is perfectly legal to prescribe these long-approved drugs. Some criticize doctors for taking this prophylactically themselves, or prescribing it to protect family or staff. Do they think doctors should stay away from patients, or fail to protect themselves?
Stores are sold out of vitamin C, and this FDA-nonapproved treatment is being used in ""massive"" doses of 1,500 mg (1.5 g) intravenously in New York, reportedly with good results. (Many people routinely take much more than that daily.) In China, the use of 20 g a day has been reported.

Many drug trials are in progress. Adult stem cells, a modality the FDA is trying to suppress, are said to be a breakthrough that restores damaged lung tissue, according to a Chinese physician. Antibodies from the plasma of recovered patients – an idea used in the 1940s to treat pneumonia – are being tried. Back then, they were less effective than X-ray treatment; both fell out of favor when antibiotics were discovered.
The best treatment methods might be new and completely untested, or on one of those forbidden websites. How will we find out what works and what doesn't if we gag people like the Chinese do?
The FDA's effectiveness testing requirements have likely kept a huge number of effective drugs off the market since instituted in 1962, and enormously increased costs. The COVID-19 crisis might lead to a better approach.
Conclusions
Advertisement - story continues below
COVID-19 can be a horrible, rapidly fatal illness in certain patients, and we cannot reliably predict which ones.
There is no evidence that a national, indiscriminate lockdown will decrease the toll of the disease, but it will do tremendous harm.
We need freedom to innovate in testing, protective equipment and treatment.

Even coronavirus couldn't stop the climate madness,"By Vijay Jayaraj
Fear of the coronavirus has taken over the world – but some people are determined to promote lies and propaganda even in the midst of the pandemic.
Advertisement - story continues below
Climate doomsayers recently held a protest in Brussels despite the coronavirus fears. On Twitter, some doomsayers, stuck in oblivion, continue to preach climate change as the planet's most imminent threat. Are they so blinded by their ambition to create climate fears that they undermine imminent health threats?
Yes.
Though the media have exaggerated coronavirus' risks, the virus is not to be taken lightly. It can live up to nine days on metal, glass and plastic surfaces, according to recent scientific studies. Scientific evidence suggests that containment and precautionary measures in the early stages of an outbreak can significantly reduce the number of infections and deaths. Precaution, not panic, is the right way forward.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

One of the key ways to stop the spread of the virus is to avoid mass gatherings. A public rally at a time like this was foolish. If one protester is infected with the coronavirus, then the protest jeopardizes the health of all the other protesters and all the people to whom they go home – and all the people with whom they, in turn, come in contact.
The most dangerous part is that not everyone infected will show signs of infection in the early stage. An individual who appears completely healthy can be carrying the virus. Unless every individual is tested, there is no way of knowing if people are infected or not. To make things more complicated, people who have tested negative have turned out be positive within a couple of days, which was the case with a Google employee in India.
Advertisement - story continues below
So a public rally in the name of climate alarmism endangers lives and does nothing to save the planet or its environment.
The protesters think climate change is as dangerous as coronavirus. ""It's pick your evil. Do you want to die from global warming or from coronavirus?"" a protester commented at the Brussels rally, led by Greta Thunberg.
But this dismal attitude is not limited to rally organizers. Doomsday activists like Greta continue to preach about the dangers of climate change, calling it the biggest crisis we have faced.
People are free to preach their own opinions. However, no one should be selling fake climate-crisis news when a medically verified pandemic is threatening to sweep the world.
Climate has always changed. In the past, cold climate caused a global emergency during the Little Ice Age in the 16th century.
Advertisement - story continues below
In the past seven decades, there have been hardly any scientific indications that the climate is in crisis. Scientists have even acknowledged a slowdown of warming during the first 14 years of this century.
Despite the El-Niño driven warmth in 2016 and other years, the last two decades have shown no signs of crisis. Agricultural outputs have increased in the past 55 years, societies have had higher life expectancies, and there has been global progress in reducing poverty.
Preaching about a non-existent climate threat during times of real health emergency is ironic, and it exposes the doomsday obsession of climate alarmists.
Once the coronavirus outbreak is over, climate doomsayers will restart their decades-long propaganda. Soon we will have a dozen hypotheses about how man-made climate change helped spread the coronavirus. They have done this blame game with other issues like the ongoing migrant crisis in Europe.

Will coronavirus imperil Trump's reelection?,"The coronavirus is throwing our economy and even our presidential election into uncertainty, as the dreadful disease spreads to Europe and South Korea.  Fear of contagion is not rampant yet in the United States, but a negative impact on our economy is already being felt and could worsen quickly.
The globalism Donald Trump was elected to confront has struck back in a big way.  Now President Trump is being forced to deal with the disastrous free trade that makes our economy so dependent on the economies of other nations.
Advertisement - story continues below
It never had to be this way.  We enjoyed prosperity for centuries without being whipsawed by what happens in China, South Korea, or Italy.
But those economies may nosedive due to the spread of the coronavirus.  A dozen towns in Italy, some near its business capital of Milan, have been essentially quarantined due to the deadly virus, which has spread to more than six regions in that country.
The Italian stock market fell by 5% in one day, because panic and isolation are not good for business. For a virus that originated in China, its devastating impact on distant Italy is alarming indeed.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

While the Italian stock market is small compared to ours, the real shock was how this deadly disease has spread so much in an unexpected place so far from China.  If this pandemic has become this severe in Italy, then how can the rest of Europe and even the United States remain untouched?
There has been the lingering suspicion that the Communist Chinese government has not been candid about the spread of the disease within its own borders.  Communist dictators have never been known for honesty and transparency, and they have every reason to mislead the world about the harm they cause.
Advertisement - story continues below
If free speech were allowed in China, then we could all learn from the internet the full extent of the risks and challenges.  Instead, we hear only what the Communist Chinese want us to hear.
Some experts admit now that a worldwide spread of the disease is inevitable.  While Trump deserves credit for keeping coronavirus mostly out of the United States, he deserves the most credit for warning against open borders.
Trump’s tariffs were a step in the right direction to reduce our dependence on the Chinese economy.  It’s unfortunate that prior presidents did not take similar steps, which would have helped insulate us from this crisis. 
Free-trade advocates never warned us about how it would result in an undesired dependency by our economy on health issues in cultures unlike ours.  The consequence of the mingling of unclean animals in a food market in China has caused our stock market to suddenly drop by more than 1,800 points in two days.
Stephen Moore, the nominee by Trump to the Federal Reserve who was then blocked by the establishment club, which excludes any outsider, astutely calls the coronavirus the ""black swan"" of the presidential election.  The term means an extraordinarily rare event that is unpredictable and almost impossible to assess as to its impact.
Advertisement - story continues below
The biggest threat to the reelection of President Trump is not Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, or Mike Bloomberg.  It is the impact the coronavirus will have on our economy, which became too dependent on foreign trade because of the policies of Trump's predecessors.
Undecided voters shift to the Republican side when they want more security, as they did when the Ebola virus created panic shortly before the 2014 midterm elections.  But if the coronavirus causes the bottom to fall out of our economy, then voters may not recognize globalism as the real culprit.
The media will wrongly blame President Trump for any downturn caused by the disease.  During the reelection campaign of President George H.W. Bush in 1992, the media blamed him for a delay in relief after Hurricane Andrew, even though it was the Democratic governor of Florida who blocked the assistance.
More than 20% of our imports are from China, and some American businesses are already feeling the pinch from a reduction there due to the coronavirus.  Tourism is also important to our economy, and nervous travelers can be expected to cancel trips rather than risk being quarantined somewhere.

President Trump can avoid the reelection campaign mistakes of prior Republicans by getting out in front of this corona catastrophe.  The political antidote is to explain how over-reliance on trade and migration from China put us in this economic quandary.

That's what a class-action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas is demanding from China for allowing the coronavirus to spread from the city of Wuhan around the world, forcing unprecedented restrictions on public life that could trigger economic recession or even depression.
On Tuesday, Larry Klayman, the founder of Judicial Watch and Freedom Watch and a former federal prosecutor, filed the complaint against China, the People's Liberation Army, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and several individuals.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Klayman insisted the lawsuit is not for political reasons but to aid the victims.
The objective, he said, is to ""have a jury award damages to the victims of China's release of the COVID-19 virus, which has already killed many Americans, exposed huge numbers of others to death and harm, caused extreme emotional distress to loved ones and friends, and is on the verge of causing a near total stock market and economic collapse.""

""There is no reason why the American taxpayer should, contrary to the [will of the] establishment in Washington, D.C., have to pay for the tremendous harm caused by the Chinese government. The Chinese people are a good people, but their government is not and it must be made to pay dearly. The huge relief package now likely to pass in Congress will further bankrupt the nation and We the People must ourselves take legal matters into our own hands,"" he said.
""The Chinese government and its officials are not immune from suit, as biological weapons are not just outlawed by international conventions, but are in effect a terrorist weapon, that are developed to destroy civilian populations.""
Klayman is assembling a team of lawyers to represent the huge numbers of Americans who have been harmed.
""This will be a costly endeavor,"" he said.
He urged Americans who want to join the class-action suit to sign up at Freedom Watch's website

The complaint states: ""This is a complaint for damages and equitable relief arising out of the creation and release, accidental or otherwise, of a variation of coronavirus known as COVID-19 by the People's Republic of China and its agencies and officials as a biological weapon in violation of China's agreements under international treaties, and recklessly or otherwise allowing its release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology into the city of Wuhan, China, in Hubei Province, by among other acts failing to prevent the institute's personnel from becoming infected with the bioweapon and carrying it into the surrounding community and proliferation into the United States.""
He said the virus amounts to a terror attack, since ""biological weapons have been outlawed since at least 1925.""
""American stock markets are in a free fall and have already lost about 30% of their value, with more severe losses expected to continue as part of a stock market crash,"" he said.
The complaint accuses China of ""aiding and abetting the risk of death or serious bodily injuries to United States citizens,"" ""provision of material support to terrorists,"" ""conspiracy,"" ""negligence,"" ""wrongful death,"" and ""assault and battery.""

The economic repercussions of the coronavirus reveal the dangers of allowing one country to have a near monopoly on global manufacturing, David Dayen explains in an article at the American Prospect:

China is a source of not only finished goods, but also of input parts and raw materials. A substantial number of the materials needed for defense and electronic systems come from China, and that nation is “the single or sole supplier for a number of specialty chemicals,” according to a recent Defense Department report. Rare earth minerals, which are critical to electronics, are largely mined in China. As a result, Chinese disruptions don’t just hit Chinese manufacturing, they hit everyone’s. Automakers have already had to slow or shut down factories globally due to supply shortages.

Online retail giant Amazon removes any product mentioning 'CORONAVIRUS',"(NATURAL NEWS) Online marketplace Amazon is removing from its website several products that claim to stop the spread of – and even cure – the new COVID-19 virus. In doing so, however, the retail giant may actually harm consumers by preventing them from being able to purchase sanitizing products that really do kill the coronavirus on surfaces such as door handles and elevator buttons.

The decision came a week after the company’s meeting with the World Health Organization (WHO) at Facebook’s offices at Menlo Park, California. According to a report by CNBC, Amazon, alongside other tech giants, discussed with the WHO several plans on how to stop the spread of misinformation about the novel coronavirus on their respective platforms.

"Mitt Romney: Give $1,000 to every American adult in response to coronavirus","Sen. Mitt Romney has proposed giving every U.S. adult a $1,000 check to help them cover their immediate financial needs and to help stimulate the economy as the country struggles to stop the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Republican from Utah announced the proposal Monday to not only contain the spread of the virus but also to curtail what is quickly becoming an economic crisis.

""Every American adult should immediately receive $1,000 to help ensure families and workers can meet their short-term obligations and increase spending in the economy,"" Romney’s office said in a news release.
The senator said that under his proposal, the stimulus checks would be a one-time cash infusion.
""Congress took similar action during the 2001 and 2008 recessions. While expansions of paid leave, unemployment insurance, and SNAP benefits are crucial, the check will help fill the gaps for Americans that may not quickly navigate different government options,” the news release said.

Romney said his proposal is in addition to measures currently being undertaken by Congress to offer financial relief to workers and businesses affected by the spread of COVID-19.
“The House coronavirus response package contains critical measures to help families in Utah and across the nation in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak, and the Senate should act swiftly on this legislation,” Romney said in a statement.

“We also urgently need to build on this legislation with additional action to help families and small businesses meet their short-term financial obligations, ease the financial burden on students entering the workforce, and protect health workers on the front lines and their patients by improving telehealth services,” he said.
“I will be pushing these measures as Senate discussions continue about an additional relief package,” the senator said.
Romney's office said the checks “will help fill the gaps for Americans that may not quickly navigate different government options.”
He also proposed offering grants, not loans, to small businesses being affected by the virus and the rapidly spreading uncertainty that has accompanied it.
Under his proposal, the Small Business Administration would grant funds to qualified small businesses that apply for but do not receive Economic Injury Disaster Loans.

“This program would ensure small businesses can meet short-term obligations, such as payroll and rent, without forcing them into future bankruptcies,” the senator's news release said.
Romney also proposed easing the financial burden for students by offering student loan deferments for recent college graduates and by increasing Pell Grant amounts to lessen “the burden on some students who had to make unexpected travel, housing, and storage purchases due to the COVID-19 outbreak.”
The Hill reported the House passed a second package early over the weekend to ease the burden of the pandemic on working Americans.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is among Republicans who are concerned that the current legislative proposals do not do enough to help Americans who are facing extreme financial burdens, and particularly those who might have been or could be laid off from work.

""Senate Republicans feel strongly that this bill must only be the beginning of Congress’s efforts to support our nation’s economy and stand with American families,"" McConnell said in a statement, The Hill reported.
McConnell added that discussions are “underway” regarding providing direct economic relief to Americans and to help stimulate the economy.
“The Senate is eager to work with the Administration and the House to deliver the solutions our nation deserves,"" he said.

Dave Ramsey gives crucial advice for coronavirus chaos: 'Don't get off a roller coaster in the middle of the ride',"Financial expert Dave Ramsey told investors that they should not ""get off a roller coaster in the middle of the ride"" as they watch the stock markets fall after the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic Wednesday.

""This is investing, and you don't lose money and you don't get off a roller coaster in the middle of the ride.""
The global stock market fluctuated Wednesday and seemed to be headed for bear market Thursday, CNN reported.
The S&P 500 opened down 6.5 percent on Thursday. If it closes at 20 percent from its all-time high, it would close in a bear market and end the longest bull-market run in U.S. history. The Dow also fell 6.9 percent and the Nasdaq fell 6.8 percent.

However, Ramsey said this market turbulence ""will be a complete memory"" in the fall of this year.
""I sat in here in 2008 yelling over and over again, 'Please don't take your money out of the market. It will be OK,'"" he said.

""The Dow went down to 6,300 from 13,000. It went in half. Not just down a little bit -- it's just down a little bit comparatively. And then it went back up to 30,000.""
Financial expert Rachel Cruze, Ramsey's daughter, added that if you have any concerns, it is a good idea to talk to your financial adviser.
""Financial advisers, they're in this all day every day, so talk to them, get their opinion, it's always the long game,"" she said. ""Never take your money out of the retirement accounts. Leave it in.""
Ramsey said there are financial opportunities in this bear market economy, such as refinancing a home.

""If you've got one of those stupid adjustable rates or a balloon mortgage or even, could you believe we would say like 5 or 6 percent interest is high? That's a high-interest mortgage. You need to refinance that baby,"" he said.
Cruze added that she tells people to ""control what you can control.""
""You can't control the global economy so do what you can for your home,"" she said. ""Things like living on a budget, getting out of debt, saving up an emergency fund, having cash in the bank if emergencies happen. Those kinds of things set you up for success in your household.""
In his address Wednesday night, President Donald Trump announced measures to try to combat the spreading of the virus including suspending travel between the United States and most European countries.

Coronavirus and CNN's talking dunderheads,"Differentiated from other diseases causing high mortality rates in birds, the earliest record of a virus killing them was 1858 – appropriately named the ""Avian flu."" Not affecting humans until much later, in January 2006, striking birds in China and Turkey, it claimed many human lives as well.
In 1918, the deadliest influenza in history spread globally. Striking indiscriminately, it took the young, old, sick and otherwise healthy. Ten percent of its victims died. Infecting a third of the global population, 50 million lives were lost. As early reports of the flu came out of Spain, it was called the ""Spanish flu,"" although it may not have originated there.
Advertisement - story continues below
In February 1957, a new virus struck in East Asia, triggering a pandemic. Appropriately named the ""Asian flu,"" it evolved from the Avian flu.
In 1968, the Hong Kong flu sprouted wings after originating in China, killing an estimated 1 to 4 million victims worldwide.
In 2009, an epidemic known as the ""Swine flu"" hit. It was appropriately named, as, originally, people contracting it had been in direct contact with pigs. Despite changing over time to impact people without such contact, it still kept the name. Apparently, once a swine virus, always a swine virus.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Whether labeled as Avian, Spanish, Asian, Hong Kong or Swine flu, each name was appropriately linked either to identify a possible animal carrier or geographic region of the world where the flu had first established a footprint. The flu's name likely didn't matter to those affected who only sought a quick diagnosis and effective cure. Those were times when the focus by governments, the medical community and the media was on a collective effort to share information about prevention and treatment, the status of the virus and providing the public with a sense of hope that those in control were acting to find a solution to isolate and eradicate the virus.
Enter the 2020 coronavirus. Never before in our history has there been a time when our people have been so divided as a national health threat looms large. Never before have we witnessed the issue of public health forged into a political sword to be raised against a serving president loathed by a liberal opposition party and media. Never have we seen the media, responsible for educating the public about such issues, fail to do so, opting instead to create non-issues.
Advertisement - story continues below
This approach by the media was most apparent following President Donald Trump's address providng an update on steps he was taking to isolate Americans from exposure to the coronavirus, including banning flights from Europe. Afterward, CNN's Jim Acosta – a longtime anti-Trumper – discussed it with his anti-Trumper soulmate, Chris Cuomo. One would have thought the main focus of the discussion between the two talking dunderheads would be solely on actions taken by the Trump administration. The senseless and moronic turn it took was outrageous.
During his speech, Trump did not refer to the current pandemic as the ""Wuhan virus"" – a label attached by many in the media and by the public since that was the province in China where coronavirus first manifested itself. Nor did Trump even label it as the ""Chinese"" flu, as was done a century earlier to denote the Spanish flu's area of origin. The only descriptor the president used was calling it a ""foreign virus."" This makes logical sense as the majority belief among researchers is the virus originated in China.
But whether intentional or not, so as to not draw attention to China, Trump merely labeled the virus generically as ""foreign."" For Acosta, however, this was insufficient; there was a need for the reporter to find something about the speech he could criticize. Thus, he zeroed in on Trump's use of the word ""foreign.""
Addressing Cuomo, Acosta said, ""… the president referred to the coronavirus as a 'foreign virus.' … One of the points that the president wanted to make tonight … is that this virus did not start here. … Why the president would go as far as to describe it as a foreign virus, that is something we'll also be asking questions about. … I think it is going to come across to a lot of Americans as smacking of xenophobia to use that kind of term in this speech.""
The hypocrisy of Acosta's smug observation trying to tag Trump as racist was later revealed in a video clip compiled by MRC-TV. It showed many CNN anchors and other talking heads referring much more damningly to the flu as the ""Wuhan"" or ""Chinese"" coronavirus. Apparently, in Acosta's mind, it was all right for the likes of Cuomo and Don Lemon to link it to China specifically but not for Trump to link it generally as ""foreign.""
Advertisement - story continues below
""Xenophobia"" means a dislike or prejudice against people from other countries. Apparently, for Acosta, this prejudice extends to things, such as viruses, as well. With such logic, even one owning a foreign-made car that is a lemon would be xenophobic if he or she referred to it as ""foreign.""
Acosta might consider his concern in view of coronavirus test kits. Such kits, foreign-made by one manufacturer, are virtually unreliable, having a 48% false negative rate – i.e., 48% of those sick would not know it from the results. No U.S. test kits are readily available due to the high FDA standards mandated. Would Acosta be offended if these Chinese-made kits were called ""foreign""so users know to steer clear of them?
So blinded by Trump Derangement Syndrome are media dunderheads like Acosta that they totally ignore their journalistic responsibilities, rushing to seize what they believe is a Trump ""gotcha"" moment, only to stumble and fall when it turns out to be a ""got me"" moment. There are issues far more import listeners should hear about in the fight against a deadly virus that Acosta's antics deny them.
Pigs have survived the stigma of Swine flu. So too have birds, the Asians, the city of Hong Kong, and the Spanish survived their descriptive flu tags. No doubt so too will Wuhan, China, even without Acosta's sanctimonious comments seeking to label Trump as racist.

Aptronym (noun): a person's name that is regarded as amusingly appropriate to their occupation.

Matt Rogers, chief of staff for Democratic Virginia state Sen. Dave Marsden, doesn't seem like he would normally fall into this category.
Then you consider his Twitter handle, @politidope. It's actually the name of his political consulting service, but it's certainly a decent digital aptronym after the events of Wednesday night.
That's when President Trump gave a phone interview to Fox News' Sean Hannity regarding coronavirus which went (sorry, but I have to say it) viral because of the spectacularly (and deliberately) wrong conclusions people reached regarding what he said.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

This wasn't indistinguishable from what happened last Friday when the president gave a speech in which he implied the left's scare tactics involving the disease and the Trump administration's putative failure to contain it ""is their new hoax.""
Politico and NBC News -- as well as countless other social media users and/or responsible adults that ought to have known better -- attempted to pass this off as Trump calling coronavirus a hoax, even though what the president said was clear in context.
Advertisement - story continues below
What he said Wednesday wasn't much different. Speaking to Hannity about the severity of coronavirus, he remarked that many who had it had such mild cases they went about their daily lives as if they had some low-level illness, never thinking it was coronavirus.
""They'll get better very rapidly, they don't even see a doctor, they don't even call a doctor,"" Trump told Hannity. ""So if, you know, we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better, just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work, some of them go to work, but they get better.""
Parts of this interview got tweeted got very widely, including by our friend @politidope. I'd venture to say he took something different away from this snippet than you did:

He didn't say that. You shouldn't go to work with coronavirus. Spreading lies about what the president said to people who will believe them because you're a doctor who agrees with them is much closer to stupid than it is to responsible citizenship.
Dr. Eugene Gu, another medico who's used the Trump administration as a self-promotion vehicle to great effect, also responded to Rogers' video.

It’s extremely irresponsible and dangerous for Trump to say that people with mild symptoms of the coronavirus can get better just by going to work. They can transmit the coronavirus to their coworkers, some of whom may have chronic medical conditions and suffer bad complications.

Perhaps he was too busy to watch the 30-second clip. Perhaps he thought you would be. Whatever the case, this is an ""extremely irresponsible and dangerous"" misinterpretation of what Trump said in the interview cloaking itself as a medical opinion.
Surprisingly, this kind of misinterpretation wasn't just limited to politidopes and their allies. The Syracuse Post-Standard even ran this headline: ""President Trump makes false claims about coronavirus, suggests you can ‘go to work’ if you’re sick.""

The Western Journal has also reached out to the office of State Sen. Marsden for comment but did not receive an immediate response.
The president, in his own inimitable style, made clear what should have been clear from the beginning:
I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work. This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats, in particular MSDNC. Comcast covers the CoronaVirus situation horribly, only looking to do harm to the incredible & successful effort being made!

I assume, by MSDNC (MSNBC), he's referring to Hayes. Whatever the case, I'll merely let you be your own judge on everything but the first sentence of the tweet. That first line, however, is unequivocally true.
Much like his ""coronavirus hoax"" remark, if you misheard it in the way anchors, doctors, newspapers and politidopes misheard it, it's because it behooved you not to get it. If you think he should be more serious about coronavirus when speaking about it, that's fine. What isn't fine is taking what Trump said and juxtaposing your own meaning on it.
In the case of Matt Rogers, he tweeted a lie along with the video that proved he was a liar.

Don't panic. That is always good advice. If you, like the world's economy, operate on just-in-time inventories and did not take advice to stock up three weeks ago, do not join a mob at a big-box store. Somebody there is no doubt infected. Plus, there's the risk of getting trampled or injured in a fist fight over the last roll of toilet paper. Most of the world survives without that luxury good. If you have no rice or beans or pasta in the pantry, that is more serious, but you should still avoid mobs if at all possible. Take-out and drive-through places are booming.
Don't treat a fever without a doctor's advice. Fever is not a disease. It is an important defense mechanism. Very high fevers (say 105 degrees) can cause brain damage, and children can have seizures. But don't pop Tylenol or ibuprofen at the first sign of fever. Many of the casualties in the 1918 pandemic might have been caused by heavy use of aspirin. Like aspirin, popular nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS) such ibuprofen also have detrimental effects on blood clotting. Try lukewarm sponge baths for comfort.
Don't rush out and get a flu shot. I know, a lot of doctors and public health authorities urge everybody to do this. Influenza can kill you, and the flu shot decreases that risk by 30% to 60% – but there is evidence that it can make COVID-19 worse, both from the earlier SARS epidemic and lab research. Like with so many things in medicine, we have to play the odds.

Don't go to the emergency room or urgent care unless you are severely ill. There will be sick people there, and you might catch something. You also might end up with a big bill, say for a CT scan you didn't really need. And if you have the flu or a cold or COVID-19, and don't need IV fluids or oxygen, they can't do anything for you. Telephone advice lines could help greatly.
Don't go to events that are crowded, especially indoors in poorly ventilated rooms. Staying home is good.

Don't demand to be tested and rely on the results. The tests are still in short supply and not very accurate. If you are at low risk, a positive test is likely to be a false positive. And if you are infected, the test may be negative at first. We need much more testing – mainly for public health monitoring.
Don't waste. Expired medications are probably still good. Most drugs or essential ingredients are made in China, and supplies are running out. Masks (also mostly made in China) are meant to be disposable, but likely can't be replaced (see below).
Don't touch your face or your eyes. That is very hard – preventing that is one function of a mask and eye protection.
Don't fall for internet scams, or malware. Hucksters will always be around to try to profit from panics. A new type of malicious virus is embedded malware in sites that come up on a search for information. (If you want to find the Johns Hopkins University dashboard of cases and deaths, go to the university's website, don't Google ""coronavirus map."")
Now for some dos:
Advertisement - story continues below
Do prepare to take care of yourself and your family. Be sure you have a fever thermometer, disposable gloves, plastic garbage bags and cleaning supplies. A pulse oximeter, available in many places for around $40, is good to have to check oxygen levels.
Do clean and disinfect surfaces such as doorknobs, telephones, computer keyboards, toilets and countertops often. Virus can persist there for days.
Do remember that sunlight is the best disinfectant. If you don't have a pocket ultraviolet lamp (they are or were available on Amazon), try putting things like masks or paper currency out in the sun. The idea should be rigorously tested, but in times of need, you may have to guess.
Do wash your hands often and use hand sanitizer. With SARS-CoV-2 (the official name of this coronavirus), most disinfectants work, including 70-percent-alcohol-based sanitizers.

Do put a mask on sick people if you can. For protecting yourself, you need a minimum of an N95 mask and eye protection.
Do take your vitamins. Most people may be vitamin D deficient. Your need for vitamin C escalates with infection. Some 50 tons of vitamin C was shipped to Wuhan, and studies of effectiveness are underway.
Do get your essential prescriptions refilled for 90 days – the supply chain depends on China. If your managed-care plan won't pay, consider paying cash. You may be able to get a good price with a coupon from goodrx.com.
Do protect your immune system, with adequate sleep, exercise, fresh air and diet, especially avoiding sugar if you feel ill.

6 in 10 approve of Trump's handling of coronavirus,"President Donald J. Trump answers media questions regarding the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) on Wednesday, March 18, 2020 (Video screenshot)
A new poll finds 60% of Americans approve of President Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis, and his overall approval numbers are near an all-time high.
Advertisement - story continues below
CNN contributor Scott Jennings noted the Gallup poll an overall 49% approval rating.
""As the coronavirus crisis unfolds and media and Democratic bashing of President Donald Trump continues, a curious thing is happening – his numbers are going up,"" he wrote. ""The question is – why? Trump has lived in a very tight job-approval zone for most of his presidency, hovering around 42-43% among registered and likely voters. But today, FiveThirtyEight's Trump job approval tracker shows him with an average approval of 44.9% and the RealClearPolitics tracker has him at 46.3%.""
Jennings suggested the president has been given a boost ""by his opposition's mishandling"" of the coronavirus crisis.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

First, ""the press along with Democrat politicians have gone overboard criticizing the president,"" the commentary explained. ""And because neither of those institutions is all that trusted by the American people – 45% of respondents in a CBS poll this week said they think the media is overreacting – they may see that overreaction as a signal that Trump has got this. Some 51% in the CBS poll said they think Trump is 'about right' in his reaction to the crisis.""
Then, Democratic ""rush to call the president racist over his terming the COVID-19 disease 'the Chinese virus' backfired. In their quest to make just about every issue about race, Democrats fell all over themselves calling Trump -- and anyone else who called the virus 'Chinese' or 'Wuhan' -- a racist, despite evidence that the virus did indeed, originate in China.""

Additionally, Americans are giving Trump ""some latitude"" on the topic, and they believe he is processing the issue ""the way a lot of people are.""
USA Today reported a Reuters/Ipsos online survey found 49% approve of the presidents handling of COVID-19.
The report said 83% of Republicans approved, 24% of Democrats and 43% of independents.
And an Economist-YouGov poll found the same.
""And an ABC News/Ipsos poll released Friday found 55% approved of Trump's response, a 12-percentage-point improvement over the week before,"" the report said.

Bloomberg reported the president's are up 6 points among Democrats and 8 points among independents, according to the survey.
The Free Beacon reported the rising numbers for the president escaped some, including possible Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden.
In an interview, he contended Trump's job approval numbers hadn't gone up and was corrected by Associated Press reporter Alexandra Jaffe.
""Gallup did show he is now at 49 percent job approval. Which is a reversal from a few weeks ago,"" she said. ""So it's just an interesting development, it does suggest that the American people see him as a stronger leader than you’ve been characterizing him.""

Expert confirms 'moderate' symptoms for most with coronavirus,"Vice President Mike Pence updates reporters on the White House response to the coronavirus (CNN screenshot)
Amid a cascade of cancelations of public gatherings, including the suspension of all major sports leagues, an infectious-disease expert confirmed Vice President Mike Pence's claim Thursday that ""the vast majority of Americans who even contract the Coronavirus will have flu-like symptoms and will fully recover.""

The vice president said he expects the number of people in the United States who contract the disease to be in the ""thousands."" So far, 1,329 cases have been recorded in the U.S. with 39 deaths.
Dr. William Shaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told Fox News in an interview that 80% of people who contract the coronavirus will have ""moderate or milder"" symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Shaffner affirmed that the focus should be on protecting older people with underlying health issues for whom the virus can be deadly.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

He was asked to respond to a study published in the British medical journal The Lancet of cases in China finding patients could spread the virus for up to 37 days after they start showing symptoms.
Shaffner said 37 days is the ""odd"" case.

""Most people don't, and the infectiousness of people does diminish rather rapidly after they recover from their illness,"" he said.
Shaffner agreed with the decisions to cancel public events to stop the spread of the disease and emphasized the importance of washing hands to interrupt the transmission of the virus from surfaces to bodies.
Pence, in an interview with ""Fox & Friends,"" said ""our experts studying global data"" have found that the coronavirus is two to three times more contagious as a respiratory illness.""
""So, we will have thousands of more cases across this country. But your viewers deserve to know that most Americans, the vast majority of Americans who even contract the Coronavirus will have flu-like symptoms and will fully recover,"" he said.

Pence noted he spoke on the phone Wednesday with a man named Clay Bentley in Rome, Georgia, who is recovering well from the disease.
""So, we don't want, as the president has conveyed, we don't want Americans to be overly concerned,"" he said. ""We want everybody to practice good common sense.""
He affirmed that in communities where the virus has spread, such as California, Washington state and New York, aggressive measures are needed, including ""social distancing,"" maintaining a distance of six feet from others.

""And we'll respect the decisions of any business, any sports enterprise that decides to cancel events to put the health of the country first,"" he said.
""But it's really important, I really believe, to focus on the most vulnerable, seniors with serious underlying health conditions,"" Pence said.
""It's the reason why we are focusing more inspections, we've raised the guidelines at nursing homes, and we're recommending that people, other than those that have family members in hospice care, special circumstances, avoid visiting nursing homes over the next 30 days,"" he said.

President Trump announced Thursday the FDA has approved the testing of a drug used to treat malaria called chloroquine as a possible COVID-19 treatment.

At the daily coronavirus task force press conference in the White House, Trump said chloroquine has shown ""very, very encouraging results"" in treating the disease caused by the coronavirus.
""I have directed the FDA to eliminate rules and bureaucracy so work can proceed rapidly, quickly and fast,"" Trump said. ""We have to remove every barrier.""
A researcher who studied the impact of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic form of chloroquine, says hydroxychloroquine could also act as a coronavirus preventative.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Trump told reporters that if chloroquine and other possible treatments work ""your numbers are going to come down very rapidly,"" referring to the number of coronavirus cases.
""It could totally depress any timeline we are talking about, if it works,"" he said.

The latest figures for the global pandemic are 236,926 cases, 9,834 deaths and 86,675 recoveries.
The president emphasized that chloroquine been on the market for years, ""so we know it's something that can be taken safely.""
He said some coronavirus patients will be treated with the drug within days.
""If we can be even partially right"" about the drug's impact, he said, ""this whole subject becomes a much more pleasant subject.""
Researchers at the University of Queensland in Australia have said they made the virus ""disappear"" using chloroquine and the HIV-suppressing combination lopinavair/ritonavir.

And a study by Stanford researchers found chloroquine tablets are showing favorable outcomes, ""including faster time to recovery and shorter hospital stay.""
The study cited research by the Centers for Disease Control showing that chloroquine also has strong potential as a preventative measure against coronavirus in the lab while a vaccine is being developed.
'Large pragmatic clinical trial'
At the task force press conference Thursday, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn noted chloroquine is already approved as a treatment for malaria and an arthritis condition.

He explained that the president has directed the FDA to determine whether its use should be expanded to treat COVID-19
""We want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial -- a large pragmatic clinical trial,"" he said.
Another treatment under consideration is called ""convalescent plasma.""
It entails collecting blood from people who have had the virus and are free of it, concentrating the blood and then giving it to patients.

""The immune response could potentially provide a benefit to patients,"" he said.
Dr. Gregory Rigano, the co-author of the Stanford study, told the Fox News Channel's Laura Ingraham Wednesday night he found that COVID-19 patients who took hydroxychloroquine were testing negative for the disease within six days.
He affirmed the drug also could act as a preventative.

World-famous museum closes due to coronavirus concerns,"Fears of infection from the coronavirus led workers of the famed Louvre in Paris to refuse to go to work Sunday, forcing the closure of the museum.
On Saturday, the French government banned indoor gatherings of more than 5,000 people, according to the BBC.

The edict was passed as a tactic to limit the spread of the virus.
On Sunday, the union representing Louvre workers held a meeting. The Louvre welcomes millions of foreign visitors annually.
""The meeting was arranged to discuss the concerns of staff,"" union official Christian Galani said, noting that the museum's management could not persuade employees to go to work.

""The Louvre is a confined space which welcomes more than 5,000 people a day,"" Galani said. ""There is real concern on the part of staff.""
“We are very worried because we have visitors from everywhere,” Andre Sacristin, a Louvre employee and union representative, said, according to The Associated Press.

“The risk is very, very, very great,” he said.
Sacristin said that although no infections have been reported among Louvre staff, given the vast numbers of people from all over the world who come to the museum, “it’s only a question of time.""
Workers asked for masks but were only given an alcohol-based solution with which to clean their hands, he said.
“That didn’t please us at all,” he said.
Sacristin said the ban on large gatherings triggered new fears among employees, as did the presence of workers from northern Italy who were at the Louvre to take back works by Leonardo da Vinci that had been loaned to the museum.

Italy has had more than 1,600 coronavirus cases and 34 reported deaths. France has had 130 cases, with two reported deaths.

President Trump and the White House Coronavirus Task Force have issued new guidelines to help protect Americans during the global Coronavirus outbreak.
The new recommendations are simple to follow but will have a resounding impact on public health. While the President leads a nationwide response, bringing together government resources and private-sector ingenuity, every American can help slow the virus’ spread and keep our most high-risk populations safe:
Listen to and follow the directions of your state and local authorities.


If you feel sick, stay home. Do not go to work. Contact your medical provider.

If your children are sick, keep them at home. Contact your medical provider.
If someone in your household has tested positive for the Coronavirus, keep the entire household at home.

If you are an older American, stay home and away from other people.
If you are a person with a serious underlying health condition—such as a significant heart or lung problem—stay home and away from other people.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Today’s guidelines build on the CDC’s general recommendations to help prevent spread of the virus. Americans should continue practicing strict personal hygiene, including washing hands regularly for at least 20 seconds at a time and wiping down surfaces in the home often.
Even if you are young and otherwise healthy, you are at risk—and your activities can increase the risk of contracting the Coronavirus for others. Everyone can do their part.

The trillions of dollars wiped from financial markets this week will be just the beginning, if our governments do not step in. And if President Trump continues to stumble in his handling of the situation, it may well affect his chances of re-election.

Twitter removed tweets from Sheriff David Clarke that mention coronavirus, yet the company has still not taken action against a Chinese official’s tweet suggesting the United States is behind the virus outbreak.
Clarke posted three tweets that have since been dinged, one encouraging people to “get back to reasonableness” and “stop buying toilet paper,” while another appeared to compare coronavirus to the flu. All three have been nixed, according to a report Monday from the Verge.

“The folks the LEFT has collapsed our institutions that have served us in times of trouble. TAKE … TO … THE … STREETS. I will no longer sit back and watch the destruction of this great republic over the FLU,” Clarke wrote Sunday in one since-nixed tweet. The tweet was archived.
Twitter revised some of its policies to “protect the public conversation around COVID-19,” according to a March 4 blog post from the company. The update also bans advertisements that “opportunistically use the COVID-19 outbreak to target inappropriate ads.”

The big tech company, meanwhile, is refusing to remove a Chinese official’s tweets suggesting the U.S. Army is responsible for injecting coronavirus into Wuhan, China. A spokesman told the Daily Caller News Foundation on March 13 that the official’s tweets do not violate company policies.
“When did Patient Zero appear in the United States? How many people are infected? What is the name of the hospital?” Lijian Zhao, deputy director of China’s Foreign Ministry Information Department, said in a March 12 tweet. “It may be that the US military brought the epidemic to Wuhan.”
Zhao added: “America needs to be transparent! The United States owes us an explanation!” Zhao also falsely stated in the tweet that Centers For Disease Control Robert Redfield was “arrested” before floating the conspiracy theory to his 317,000 followers.
The first case of coronavirus, or COVID-19, is believed to have appeared December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The virus has spread since February to 36 other countries and territories and has a global death toll of 3,041, according to the CDC‘s numbers.
Deaths from the virus in China hit 811 on Feb. 9, surpassing the number of patients who died from SARS, China’s National Health Commission noted at the time. China has reported roughly 80,000 cases since February, though the number of cases in the country appears to be declining.

Coronavirus and the southern border,"There's scarcely a moment in news that you can avoid the crisis we face, the fight against the coronavirus. The virus dominates every news story, as we listen to those addressing how the virus will affect our lives – today and in the future.
I live in California in the San Francisco Bay Area, and we are faced with rules and regulations as to how we can live our daily lives.  We have to practice ""social distancing"" – keeping a certain distance from people as we relate to them.  How close we should get to them, how often should we associate with them, and where and how.
Advertisement - story continues below
Depending on our age, we are given rules as to how and when we should leave our homes –  where we can go and how and when.  In other words, we are to ""shelter in place."" We are told that it's OK to go to the doctor, the pharmacy,  the food market  – but other than that, stay put inside the house – and no entertaining or visiting family.
On top of that, schools are closed, so parents have to deal with the reality that the children will be home all day, every day.  How do they deal with that, especially if the parents work?  It's tough. In fact, Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has now imposed ""shelter in place"" on the entire state, says the reality is that school may not open again this school year.
In fact, breaking any of these rules is considered a misdemeanor.  Whether your local police would cite you depends on their attitude, but the fact remains, they have the right to write that ticket. 

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Did you ever think we would face such a situation? Most of us never dreamed of it.
There's  no doubt that some people might get stir-crazy from such rules, and in fact, it's already happening.   One clear example for me is the fact that on my daily dog-walk on nearby trail, which usually is relegated to a few other dog-walkers and cyclists, yesterday and today was a traffic jam of parents and kids and bikes and dogs.

So much for staying away from other people! 
While media are enthralled with the issues facing Americans because of the coronavirus, they are virtually ignoring the fact that President Trump has plans for stronger border enforcement.  In fact, the administration plans to turn back all asylum-seekers and other foreigners attempting to enter this country illegally.
You would think that would rate a headline, given the media opposition to border enforcement.  But no, I haven't seen a mention of it.
Administration officials say we cannot risk allowing the virus to spread through detention facilities and expose Border Patrol agents. 
Sounds logical to me.  Under the new rule, agents will immediately return to Mexico anyone who attempts to cross our southern border between legal ports of entry.  There will be no detainment in any U.S. facility and no due process.

According to the Border Patrol, we have been flooded with thousands of foreign nationals from countries affected by the coronavirus. Department of Homeland Security figures show that since October 2019, nearly 151,000 border crossers and illegal aliens from 72 countries affected by the virus have been apprehended at our border.
Since October, 1,657 Chinese nationals have been apprehended at our southern border – according the DHS,  they present  a unique public health threat. No kidding.  They're from China, the source of the coronavirus.
But they're not alone.  According to Breitbart, since October, 6,400 Brazilians have arrived at our border along with eight Iranians, 12 Italians, 345 Russians, 160 Romanians, 204 Vietnamese, 827 Indians, 1,045 Cameroonians, plus 21,000 Hondurans. All those countries have confirmed coronavirus cases.
In addition migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Nicaragua Venezuela – 44,370 of them, arrived at our border after traveling thru coronavirus-affected Mexico. That country has confirmed 164 cases of the coronavirus, with one death.

Interestingly enough, Mexico is considering closing its northern border with the United States over fears of the spread of the coronavirus. 
Make note – Mexico wants to close its northern border to prevent people on our side from crossing into Mexico. How's that for a switch?
Never mind the illegality of border crossing without papers.  Never mind criminals crossing the border.  Never mind drug or weapon smuggling across the border.  Never mind human trafficking across the border.
Yet, Mexico has not closed schools – as we have.  Nor has Mexico closed its borders to people coming from places with high numbers of coronavirus cases. But Mexico plans to crack down on the U.S. border!

Christopher Landau, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, told Mexican lawmakers that completely open borders don't benefit either country.  ""We see it now with the virus, and hopefully we can work closely together because in health issues, political parties and borders aren't important.""
My reaction to that?

Iran caught selling its citizens fake anti-bacterial spray against coronavirus,"(BREAKING ISRAEL NEWS) -- As Iran is suffering from the worst coronavirus outbreak after China, one would think that their government would take precautions against the pandemic seriously.
But that appears to be too much to ask after the Islamic Republic was caught selling its citizens air freshener disguised as an anti-bacterial spray.

One journalist, Heshmat Alavi, exposed the story of one citizen who was duped by the government ploy. Alavi showed the video on Twitter where the man says: “I purchased an anti-bacterial spray at a drug store. When I tore off the label, I saw its actually an air freshener… They’re selling air fresheners as anti-bacterial sprays. The brand belongs to the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC),” the man says.”

WHO: At least 20 coronavirus vaccines in development in global race for cure,"(CNBC) The World Health Organization is working with scientists across the globe on at least 20 different coronavirus vaccines with some already in clinical trials in record time — just 60 days after sequencing the gene.

“The acceleration of this process is really truly dramatic in terms of what we’re able to do, building on work that started with SARS, that started with MERS and now is being used for COVID-19 ,” Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for WHO’s emergencies program, said at a press conference at the organization’s headquarters in Geneva on Friday.

Pray for God's mercy during coronavirus pandemic,"It is true that God is a righteous Judge who will one day pour out His wrath on a rebellious world. But the overwhelming emphasis of Scripture is not on the wrath of God but rather on His mercy. As the psalmist proclaimed, ""The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in love"" (Psalm 103:8).
Can you imagine if God's character were the opposite of this? If He were slow to mercy and abounding in anger? We would have been wiped out many millennia ago.
Advertisement - story continues below
As the psalmist continued, ""He will not always accuse, nor will he harbor his anger forever; he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us. As a father has compassion on his children, so the Lord has compassion on those who fear him; for he knows how we are formed, he remembers that we are dust"" (Psalm 103:9–14).
And remember: These words were written long before the cross. Long before God displayed His love for us through His Son. Long before the perfect Savior paid for our sins. Yet the psalmist, David himself, understood the greatness of God's mercy and kindness. And compassion and longsuffering. That is who our God is.
The prophet Micah, who had much to say about divine judgment, also said this about the Lord: ""Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy"" (Micah 7:18).

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Our God delights to show mercy.
Similarly, the prophet Ezekiel, who also prophesied about the judgment of God, said this on behalf of the Lord: ""Rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed, and get a new heart and a new spirit. Why will you die, people of Israel? For I take no pleasure in the death of anyone, declares the Sovereign Lord. Repent and live!"" (Ezekiel 18:31–32)

Yes, our righteous God looks for opportunities to show mercy. He desires to demonstrate His compassion. And while He will not overlook our rebellion and sin – that is, if we refuse to turn away from it – He is longing to forgive.
The book of Genesis contains a remarkable dialogue between the Lord and Abraham, related as a face to face conversation between the two. (See Genesis 18:16-33.)
The Lord is about to destroy the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah because of their wickedness. But Abraham's nephew, Lot, lives in Sodom, along with his wife and children. So God, in His incredible condescension, wants to let Abraham know in advance, prompting Abraham to take a bold step in faith.
As Genesis records, ""Then Abraham approached him and said: 'Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing – to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the Judge of all the earth do right?'"" (Genesis 18:23–25) 
What an extraordinary prayer. And what an outrageous appeal.

To paraphrase, ""God, I know that You have every right to judge these places, but You are a righteous Judge. And that means You won't destroy the innocent along with the guilty. So, if you find 50 righteous people there, will You spare the whole population?""
Remarkably, the Lord – the Creator and Sustainer of the universe – acceded to Abraham's request: ""I will spare the city for the sake of the 50.""
But Abraham wasn't done.
""What if there are 45 righteous?""
Advertisement - story continues below
""I'll spare it,"" was the reply.
""How about 40?""
Abraham was really going out on a limb!
Amazingly, the Lord said yes to that request as well.
Advertisement - story continues below
In fact, He said yes to everyone of Abraham's requests, which ended with God agreeing to spare the entire city of Sodom if He could find just 10 righteous people in it.
Sadly, He could not, so judgment was poured out.
Yet we get an incredible glimpse into God's heart toward His creation. He will bend over backwards to withhold judgment. He will give us every chance to repent. He will be incredibly longsuffering and patient. Only then will His wrath be poured out.
The ultimate proof of this is found in the cross. There, rather than God pouring out His judgment on all of us – yes, all of us are guilty sinners in His sight – He poured out judgment on His Son. Jesus took our place. Jesus bore our guilt. Jesus paid for our sins.
Advertisement - story continues below
That is the heart of the gospel. That is the heart of God.
As we pray, then, for the Lord's intervention in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, let us appeal to His mercy and compassion. God alone knows what caused this viral outbreak, and God alone can dramatically turn the tide.
So we pray, ""Have mercy on us, O Lord! And grant us repentance from our sins. We have no hope outside of You.""

Landlord challenges others to offer financial relief by waiving rent during coronavirus pandemic,"In these times of uncertainty, it can be hard to know where the next toilet paper roll will come from, let alone next month's rent. That's especially true for people who are dependent on jobs that have been shut down or outsourced.
With people being told to stay in their homes and avoid the spread of the coronavirus, some are worrying about even having a home to stay in -- but for at least one generous landlord's tenants, that problem has been solved.

Nathan Nichols of South Portland, Maine, has two rental units and six tenants, according to WLBZ-TV. He's decided to waive the April rent for his tenants, and he posted his rationale on Facebook along with an invitation for other landlords of means to follow suit.
""COVID19 is going to cause serious financial hardship for service and hourly workers around the country,"" he shared on Monday. ""I own a two unit in South Portland and all of my tenants are in this category.
""Because I have the good fortune of being able to afford it and the privilege of being in the owner class, I just let them know I would not be collecting rent in April. I ask any other landlords out there to take a serious look at your own situation and consider giving your tenants some rent relief as well.""

A South Portland landlord is not collecting rent from his tenants for the month of April due to the coronavirus. He posted his decision on Facebook in hopes other landlords think about doing the same thing. His post has more than 20,000 shares @newscentermaine pic.twitter.com/A3xnftpz0L

In an update on his post, he mentioned that many landlords told him they'd love to extend the same pay grace that he had, but that they were just not in a position to do so.

""Apparently, mortgage lenders are providing relief to those who qualify, but you have to reach out to them,"" Nichols said. ""Talk to your tenants and find out their situation, then talk to your lender and ask for assistance. Comment if you have any success!""


The post got over 24,000 shares and over a thousand comments, with many people commending him, wishing they could do the same or wishing their landlords were as gracious.

""If I could inspire other landlords to do the same, I certainly didn't expect it to blow up with the way it did,"" Nichols said, according to WLBZ.
A couple of days later, he got some encouraging news in the form of a comment.
""Two days ago I posted that, in order to mitigate economic hardship caused by COVID-19, I would not be collecting rent in April from two units that I own,"" Nichols wrote in a recap. ""I also called on other landlords to look at their situations and see if it was in their power to help their own tenants. ...

""Of more than 500 comments, almost all of them are words of thanks or praise for the kindness of my act.
""Every so often, however, there is a comment from a landlord who would like to help their tenants, but simply can’t, or from a tenant who wishes their landlord would help them, but doubts they will.
""To these people, I say: I don’t know your situation and I don’t want to imply that a landlord who isn’t forgoing rent is somehow a bad person. And then, finally, about an hour ago, this:""

The comment was from a woman who was apparently also a landlord, and she wrote that she would ""be following suit."" Nichols seemed happy to have made such a difference.

""Younger people may feel more confident about their ability to withstand a virus like this,"" Dr. Christopher Carlsten, head of respiratory medicine at the University of British Columbia, told The Times.

""The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases among persons in the United States increases with age,"" the CDC's report read.

The fatality rate -- the number who died as a percentage of the overall number infected -- also skewed toward the elderly.

""But the fatality rate was 14.8% in people 80 or older, likely reflecting the presence of other diseases, a weaker immune system, or simply worse overall health. By contrast, the fatality rate was 1.3% in 50-somethings, 0.4% in 40-somethings, and 0.2% in people 10 to 39,"" STAT reported.
The report pointed out that a World Health Organization mission to China noted that as of mid-January, no children in Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, had the virus. Across China, young people aged 10 to 19 were only 1.2 percent of those infected, the report said.

“Poorer outcomes in older people may be due, in part, to the age-related weakening of the immune system and increased inflammation that could promote viral replication and more prolonged responses to inflammation, causing lasting damage to the heart, brain and other organs,” said Zhibo Liu of Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, who reported on a study showing that the impact in China was hardest on the elderly, according to New Scientist.

Faust said when he investigated a published death rate, he found much to doubt.
“What I was able to find by looking at a few other data sources, rather than just the big flashy numbers, was that there’s actually a lot of reason to be reassured that the numbers are a lot lower,” Faust said.
“If you get to people over 70, we’re going to have much higher fatality rates,"" Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told ABC.

""I think [people] ought to take a deep breath and spend a little more time planning what to do if the coronavirus really came into their community and they had to undergo what we call social distancing, which is separating themselves from other people. If you do this now when you’re more calm, it works much better when you really have to apply it rather than planning in a more anxious moment later on.”
Schaffner said the elderly ""accumulate a whole lot of underlying illnesses, which adds to their risk. They have heart disease, diabetes, lung disease.""
""Some of these people, particularly from China, have lived in polluted environments their whole life. Some of the men, especially, have been lifetime smokers. So they are at very increased risk of severe disease.”

Considering the history of draconian ulterior self-serving machinations by feckless politicians, why should I blindly accept their claims at face value?

Governors have ordered the closing of all restaurants, bars, theaters, stores and gyms. Supposedly this is because gatherings of 50 or more persons exacerbate the potential for transmitting the coronavirus.
But these same states haven't shut down airports. They would have us believe that going to school, a restaurant, a bar, a movie or a gym – to eat/drink, watch a film, and/or exercise – is dangerous, but waiting in a crowed airport in preparation to enter a sealed pressurized container with 100 or more people is OK. We're not safe in a restaurant but supposedly we're safe in a sealed container for two to six hours with people coughing, sneezing, snoring, changing children's diapers, etc.
As I write this article, is has been approximately 24 hours that a longtime dear friend and colleague lost his wife to H1N1. She had spent time with family and friends out of state and then flew home where almost immediately upon arriving she exhibited symptoms of this virulent virus. Less than two weeks later my friend's wife went to be with the Lord.

There's been no backtracking to see where she contracted the H1N1 virus. There's been no investigation of every person on the filled-to-capacity flight she traveled home on. But I'm supposed to passively accept that it's too dangerous for me to enjoy an evening of dinner and cigars with friends?
The subways and rail lines haven't been shut down. We're to believe it's a public safety menace to take in movie or have dinner with friends, but riding on a crowded subway where people cough, sneeze, brush and rub against one another is OK? Traveling from Atlanta to Manhattan on a train filled with strangers who could have a cold or flu is fine, but working out at the local gym for 45 minutes is a threat to society? Really? We're supposed to accept that at face value without question?

Something else that's not being discussed gives me cause for question. Are we simply to accept that the door isn't wide open for the dark minions with proven global track records of currency manipulation? Are we to accept that lurking in the shadows, nefarious wraith-like creatures that feast upon financial calamity they mastermind in times of crisis aren't at work now?
In observing the current hysteria, I question what happens next year and the year thereafter should the Lord tarry. Or perhaps we're not supposed to know that flu viruses don't go away. Will it be necessary to cancel church services and weddings, mandate the closing of all stores, restaurants, theaters, bars and gyms in the years up coming? Will it be necessary to cancel portions of the season for all sports? Or does the panic we're witnessing have only a one-year shelf life?
There's one other thing that it seems the public is being carefully steered away from questioning. Suppose this virus didn't escape from a level-4 bio facility in Wuhan, China. Suppose that's just the cover story the Chinese government finds most convenient to propagate.
Pulitzer Prize nominee Jon Rappoport, an investigative reporter for 30 years, writes:
""Where did SARS begin? Where was it first found? Guangdong, China. In their excellent book, 'Virus Mania,' Torsten Engelbrecht and Claus Kohnlein explore non-virus causes of flu-like illness in that locale. They found causes. It turns out this area is one of the world's largest recyclers of e-waste:
Advertisement - story continues below
'Guangdong is China's largest industrial area … extremely polluted. Garbage lies everywhere; above all high-tech waste. … For $1.50 a day, locals disassemble computers, monitors and printers with their bare hands, endangering both their own health and the environment. … There, workers empty toner cartridges from laser printers the whole day long without protective masks, breathing in fine carbon dust. Others, mostly women and girls, dip circuit boards into baths of liquid lead to separate and collect the soldering materials with which the memory chips and processors are attached to the plates. Unprotected, they are exposed to toxic fumes. While the plastic plates are simply burned up, the chips and processors are put in acid baths, to extract their gold. Here as well, poisonous fumes are generated, and the unusable leftover acids are just dumped into the river. A lot of garbage is simply burned up or dumped onto rice fields, irrigation facilities or into waterways. The bodies of water and groundwater around Guiys have become so contaminated that drinking water has to be brought in daily from other cities. …'
""A real cause of real illness. No need for a virus. Except … as a cover story."" (See: ""Coronavirus Covert Operation,"" Feb. 27, 2020.)
Suppose, it's easier for the Chinese government to promulgate the idea that this coronavirus escaped from bio lab, than to have the world find out the nation's ecosystem in any number of areas is thoroughly poisoned from their reckless disregard pursuant to waste and chemical disposal?
This isn't as extreme of a question when we consider that the consensus opinion is coronavirus wasn't created in the Wuhan meat markets. However, consensus is the virus did show up there in the seafood and meats.

Limbaugh reveals REAL source of coronavirus and every American needs to take notice,"Conservative radio personality Rush Limbaugh sounded the alarm on the origins of new diseases as well as older ones that were thought to be eradicated but are making a comeback.
All of these diseases are coming from leftist communities, both in the United States and abroad, Limbaugh noted.

Take the new coronavirus that has people in fear worldwide. The disease has been reported to be coming from one particular community in Wuhan, China.
The virus is believed to have originated from the sale of illegal wildlife at one seafood market in the city, the BBC reported.
“The respiratory infection, which is closely related to SARS and MERS, has been spreading across China, and cases have been diagnosed in several other countries, including the United States,” WebMD said of the disease.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

The virus has now resulted in 132 deaths from the more than 6,000 cases that have been reported worldwide, with all of the deaths and the overwhelming majority of infections centered in China.
Of the handful of cases that have been reported in the United States, at least two of the patients traveled to Wuhan.

“Symptoms include a fever, coughing, and shortness of breath. They may appear 2 to 14 days after you’re exposed to the virus,” WebMD said.
On his program Friday, Limbaugh talked about the coronavirus outbreak as well as other diseases that have been hitting the state of California hard. Those include typhoid fever, typhus, hepatitis A, staph and tuberculosis.
“Where are all of these deadly viruses coming from?"" the host asked, according to the transcript on his official website. ""Communist countries. This latest virus that’s got everybody scared to death, where is it coming from? The ChiComs.
""What’s happening in all of these homeless tent cities in California? Medieval diseases that had been eradicated are starting to crop up.""
Limbaugh continued, ""Do not doubt me when I tell you that liberalism, left-wingism, socialism, communism, whatever, folks, it destroys.

“It is not compassion. It is not love. It is not wanting the best for everybody. It is not equality. It’s not sameness. It’s not fairness.
“It is the epitome of mean-spiritedness! Liberalism looks at people and sees failure, inability. Liberals look at people, average people in their eyes with contempt.
California cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco have been overwhelmed with legions of homeless Americans.
These people did not pick liberal cities at random. It is the policies of these progressive “Utopias” that drive the increase in homelessness, including those on drug abuse and alcoholism.
Advertisement - story continues below
A street poll of the San Francisco homeless in 2019 found 42 percent of those who participated admitted to dependence on drugs and alcohol, City Journal reported.
So, what is the liberal city’s response to that? It hands out 4.5 million syringes yearly, accompanied by vitamin C, which helps to dissolve the crack and heroin, and instructions on how to best inject drugs, City Journal reported.
This is not compassion; it is lunacy. It welcomes throngs of homeless people who, as they have no place else to go, defecate in the streets and waterways, which directly leads to horrible diseases.
And those cities' welcoming policies toward illegal aliens are not helping matters, either.

“Drug sellers are as shameless as drug users,"" City Journal said. ""Hondurans have dominated the drug trade in the Tenderloin and around Civic Center Plaza and Union Square since the 1990s. They congregate up to a dozen a corner, openly counting and recounting large wads of cash, completing transactions with no attempt at concealment.
“Most of the dealers are illegal aliens. One might think that city leaders would be only too happy to hand them off to federal immigration authorities, but the political imperative to safeguard illegal aliens against deportation takes precedence over public order. Local law enforcement greets any announced federal crackdown on criminal aliens with alarm.""
It is mind-boggling that people who live in such cities and states continue to vote for the politicians who enact these policies.
If people want to get serious about fixing the homeless crisis and the diseases it brings, they have to get to the root of the issue.

Fate of 2020 Tokyo Olympics has been decided amid coronavirus fears,"As the threat of coronavirus spreads across the world, the International Olympic Committee and Japanese organizers of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics are continuing to prepare for the summer games as planned, according to a spokesman for the Japanese government.
Spokesman Yoshihide Suga reassured the public that the games are currently still on despite comments made by former IOC vice president Dick Pound who said organizers will have to decide what they will do about the games in the next three months, Fox News reported.

""With regard to this member's comment, the IOC has responded that this is not their official position, and that the IOC is proceeding with preparations toward the games as scheduled,"" Suga said.
The summer Olympics are scheduled to begin on July 24 in Tokyo with 11,000 athletes in attendance. The Paralympics will begin a month later on Aug. 25 with 4,400 athletes.
In a Tuesday interview with The Associated Press, Pound said that the fate of the games was being threatened by the virus that has spread from China.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

As of Wednesday morning, there have been over 81,000 coronavirus cases worldwide and 2,770 fatalities. According to Fox News, there have been five deaths from the COVID-19 illness in Japan and in China, there have been 2,715 deaths on the mainland.
Pound told the AP that the IOC has a three-month window to decide what will happen to the 2020 Olympics in response to the illness, suggesting other options including postponing or moving the event.

“This is the new war and you have to face it,"" he said. ""In and around that time, I’d say folks are going to have to ask: ‘Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo, or not?’”
If the Olympics cannot go on, ""you're probably looking at a cancellation,"" Pound said.
The modern Olympics have only been canceled during wartime and faced boycotts in Montreal in 1976, Moscow in 1980 and Los Angeles in 1984. The 1940 Olympics in Tokyo were also canceled because of Japan's war with China and World War II.
The three-month window Pound gave includes sponsors and television broadcasters as well as athletes and fans who will all need to confirm their travel plans within that time.
Pound has been an IOC member since 1978 and served two terms as vice president. He was also the founding president of the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Despite the looming uncertainty predicted by Pound, he encouraged athletes to continue training as normal.
“As far as we all know you’re going to be in Tokyo,” Pound said. “All indications are at this stage that it will be business as usual. So keep focused on your sport and be sure that the IOC is not going to send you into a pandemic situation.”
For its part, Japan is working on curbing the spread of the virus within the country and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe asked organizers to cancel or postpone major sports and cultural events, according to Fox News.
""The next one to two weeks is extremely important for the prevention of the escalation of the infection,"" he said. ""We ask organizers to cancel, postpone or scale down the size of such events.""

The containment period gives researchers time to try to understand the virus and develop and test possible vaccines and antiviral drugs. There is currently no cure.
This containment strategy also bolsters efforts to prevent the spread of the virus by keeping confirmed cases isolated from the rest of the community and enforcing travel restrictions.

Unless the coronavirus becomes a worldwide mass killer, it will be fair to say that the hysteria over coronavirus will cause much more suffering than the virus.
All this leads to three questions:
1. Why aren't we seeing a sober, measured reaction to the virus?
2. What has caused this hysteria?
Advertisement - story continues below
3. Why are so many people in panic mode?
Answer to question 1: Because people have lost all perspective.
This flu, like SARS and swine flu before it, has been given a name. Every year tens of thousands of people die of that season's generic flu. In the 2017-2018 flu season, in America alone, according to the CDC, about 61,000 people died of the flu. But because that flu didn't have a special name, no one other than individuals close to those who died from the flu knows or cares about any no-name flu.
In 2003, there was hysteria over SARS, which also originated in China, and which killed a total of 774 people in 29 countries.
Advertisement - story continues below
In 2009, the World Health Organization, which should be renamed the World Hysteria Organization, raised the worldwide pandemic alert level of the swine flu (a variant of the H1N1 virus) to Phase 6, the highest alert level.
According to the CDC, the swine flu infected approximately 61 million Americans, of whom 12,269 died. To put that into perspective, also according to the CDC, the next season's flu, that of 2010-2011, killed about 37,000 Americans; in 2012-2013, 43,000 died of the flu; and as noted, in 2017-2018, 61,000 died (the CDC's upper figure was 95,000).
Answer to question 2: Overwhelmingly because of the news media. The news media have been breathlessly reporting virtually every new diagnosis of the coronavirus 24/7. Typical of media reporting is this from Canada's most widely read newspaper, The Globe and Mail: ""COVID-19 spreads so rapidly that one Harvard researcher has warned that 40 to 70 percent of the world's adults will be infected."" But they never bother to tell you that being ""infected"" is, for almost everyone, not remotely life-threatening.
Answer to question 3: This one is perplexing.
Advertisement - story continues below
I am not certain why people panic so easily. Perhaps it is built into human nature. Perhaps it is the power of the media to influence people. Perhaps it is because life is so easy in the modern world that people have come to expect a life without deadly illness or premature death from any cause. Perhaps it is because of the lack of perspective noted above.
There are things about which people should be panicked. For example, the contempt for America and capitalism taught to a generation of young Americans from elementary school through college is worthy of panic. The extreme levels of economy-collapsing debt we are irresponsibly piling onto the backs of future generations to maintain ""entitlements"" is worthy of panic. So is the premature sexualization of children – encouraging them to choose their own gender and taking 5-year-olds to public libraries for ""drag queen story hour."" But such things hardly register with most Americans.
I feel awful for kids today. They are relentlessly told that global warming poses an ""existential threat"" to life on earth. They are relentlessly told that President Donald Trump poses an ""existential threat to America"" – the words used, for example, a few weeks ago by Frank Rich in New York Magazine, and used by the ""moderate"" Mike Bloomberg repeatedly in his speeches. And now they are told their families had better stock up on toilet paper because only God knows when they will be unable to leave their homes.
It was a Democratic president who told Americans, during World War II no less, that ""we have nothing to fear but fear itself."" He is a liberal idol, in part for saying that.

The representative did not provide a reason for not going on the record.
The representative cited language on its website stating: “Direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules.”

Such language applies to recent examples of Chinese officials using the platform as a propaganda tool, the Daily Beast reported, citing the representative. The policy allowing world officials to clobber each other also appears to allow them to distribute disinformation wantonly.
A Twitter spokeswoman confirmed the report to the Daily Caller News Foundation. She did not provide a reason for not going on the record.
Chinese senior official Lijian Zhao on March 12 tweet suggesting the United States is trying to covertly inject the virus into China does not violate Twitter rules, a company spokesman told the DCNF on March 12. .
“When did Patient Zero appear in the United States? How many people are infected? What is the name of the hospital?” Zhao, deputy director of China’s Foreign Ministry Information Department, said in the tweet. “It may be that the US military brought the epidemic to Wuhan.”
Zhao added: “America needs to be transparent! The United States owes us an explanation!” Zhao also falsely stated in the tweet that Centers For Disease Control Robert Redfield was “arrested” before floating the conspiracy theory to his 317,000 followers. Redfield was not apprehended.

Officials can use the platform for so-called saber-rattling, while distributing disinformation. Zhao followed up that missive with another tweet Sunday suggesting the CDC “admitted some of patients were misdiagnosed as flu during 2019 flu season.”
“If #COVID19 began last September, & US has been lack of testing ability, how many would have been infected? US should find out when patient zero appeared,” Zhao added, implying that patient zero came from the United States.
Health officials say the virus began in China’s Wuhan region and expanded geometrically from there despite his suggestions otherwise.
Twitter has let other examples of misinformation slide as well.

The company appeared to give Tesla CEO Elon Musk told his Twitter followers March 20 that children are “essentially immune” to coronavirus, or COVID-19. Twitter previously stated that such a claim was impermissible, yet it appeared to backtrack after Musk made his comment.
“We reviewed the Tweets, and they don’t violate our rules at this time. Please continue to share anything you think we should take a closer look at — we’ll continue to rely on trusted partners, such as health authorities, to flag content that is harmful,” Twitter said in a statement to Axios.

"Coronavirus threatens your 'digital liberties,' privacy group warns","

It may be necessary to curb some civil liberties in times of emergency, such as the coronavirus outbreak, but any measure must he limited and temporary, the the Electronic Frontier Foundation advised Tuesday.
""As in other major emergencies in the past, there is a hazard that the data surveillance infrastructure we build to contain COVID-19 may long outlive the crisis it was intended to address,"" the organization said. ""The government and its corporate cooperators must roll back any invasive programs created in the name of public health after [the] crisis has been contained.""
Closely related to that concern is the worry over transparency.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

""Any government use of 'big data' to track virus spread must be clearly and quickly explained to the public. This includes publication of detailed information about the information being gathered, the retention period for the information, the tools used to process that information, the ways these tools guide public health decisions, and whether these tools have had any positive or negative outcomes.""
And undoubtedly there will be conflicts with constitutional rights, it said.

""If the government seeks to limit a person's rights based on this 'big data' surveillance (for example, to quarantine them based on the system's conclusions about their relationships or travel), then the person must have the opportunity to timely and fairly challenge these conclusions and limits,"" EFF's report said.
The organization said that in its response to COVID-19, governments around the globe ""are collecting and analyzing personal information about large numbers of identifiable people, including their health, travel and personal relationships.""
Such ""special efforts"" are warranted, the group said, because ""public policy must reflect a balance between collective good and civil liberties in order to protect the health and safety of our society from communicable disease outbreaks.""
The threats come when ""life-saving programs such as these, and their intrusions on digital liberties, to outlive their urgency.""
EFF said programs that collect information about people en masse must be ""scientifically justified and deemed necessary by public health experts for the purpose of containment.""
Advertisement - story continues below
And, the report said, there is historic precedent for such global efforts to incorporate ""improper government containment efforts driven by bias based on nationality, ethnicity, religion, and race – rather than facts about a particular individual’s actual likelihood of contracting the virus, such as their travel history or contact with potentially infected people.""
Already troubling, EFF said, are reports the Chinese government demands citizens load software to their phones so it can monitor every place they go.
The software then assigns a color code to ""indicate their health status.""
The U.S. also is facing concerns about its response, including a rule by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that demands ""airline companies to collect the name and contact information of all passengers and crew arriving in the United States on international flights, and to transmit this information to the CDC within 24 hours of an order to do so,"" the report said.
Advertisement - story continues below
Will that information be purged when it no longer is pertinent?
""Some use of big data may now be warranted as public health officials work to contain COVID-19. But it must be medically necessary, as determined by public health experts; any new processing of personal data must be proportionate to the actual need; people must not be scrutinized because of their nationality or other demographic factors; and any new government powers must expire when the disease is contained,"" the report said.

"Yes, coronavirus is the 'Chinese virus'","This week, President Donald Trump came under fire for his use of the phrase ""Chinese virus"" to describe the coronavirus, the source of the new pandemic that has led to a global economic shutdown as well as lockdowns of citizens in every major Western country. That media have somehow found time to home in on the one issue that matters least – the labeling of a Chinese virus as such – in the middle of an unprecedented planet-wide freeze demonstrates the utter unseriousness of those objecting. That the term should be controversial at all is nearly beyond belief. The virus did indeed originate in China. Most of all, that the Chinese government should be shielded in any way from the results of its own pathological and tyrannical misgovernment is perverse beyond measure.
Make no mistake: The Chinese government is chiefly responsible for the explosion of this pandemic. The so-called wet markets of China – the meat markets that often include wild animals ranging from snakes to pangolins – exist for a variety of reasons, ranging from price to superstitious belief in medicinal properties of exotic animals. According to Zhenzhong Si, research associate at the University of Waterloo, ""Eating wild animal is considered a symbol of wealth because they are more rare and expensive."" Whatever the rationale, the Communist Chinese government has been exceedingly tolerant of such markets, even though they have now been responsible for the spread of coronavirus, SARS, bird flu, Asian flu and swine fever. The Chinese government has been similarly tolerant of treatment via traditional Chinese medicine rather than evidence-based medicine, which has increased the risk of such diseases.

The same Chinese government now being praised for its extraordinary crackdown on its own citizens – the same government that is said to be imprisoning up to a million Uighurs for no specific crimes – has been unwilling for decades to stop the selling of exotic animals. Authoritarianism obviously doesn't apply to the most obvious solution to a bevy of possible epidemics.
Meanwhile, the Chinese government acted early to shut down the spread of information about the coronavirus, which paved the way for freedom of travel by carriers of the disease. When ophthalmologist Li Wenliang told fellow doctors about coronavirus in an online chat room in December, he was forced to swear by the Chinese government that he had been making ""untrue statements."" He ended up dying of the disease. When further information began to emerge about the coronavirus, the Communist government simply lied about it, suggesting that case numbers were not rising – a lie bought by the World Health Organization.
Even now the Chinese government continues to spread propaganda suggesting that the coronavirus originated in the United States. Lijian Zhao, deputy director-general of the Information Department of China's Foreign Ministry, tweeted a link to an article he claimed had ""Evidence that the Virus Originated in the US."" And is it truly believable that China had just 127 diagnosed cases of coronavirus between March 9 and March 16, even as the Chinese government expels American journalists en masse from both China and Hong Kong?

Once this is all over, it's far past time for Americans to have a serious discussion about the extent to which openness to China ought to be curbed. The Trump administration should consider a travel ban on China until China has verifiably shut down its exotic animals markets, at the very least. The current crisis will cost millions of American jobs, millions more of Americans' savings and thousands of American lives. To trust the Chinese government after a global betrayal of this magnitude would not only be foolish; it would be immoral.

Will coronavirus sink Trump's reelection?,"Until the coronavirus outbreak, most conservatives were pretty confident President Donald Trump would get reelected. The economy was doing great, which is a good sign an incumbent president will win a second term. But the coronavirus may change things. We may end up in a recession.
Although only 70 people in the U.S. have died from it so far, the country is taking drastic action to reduce the spread of coronavirus. The flu kills about 12,000 people in the U.S. each year, but the coronavirus is 10 times more deadly than the flu.

The extreme measures being taken are hurting the economy and jobs. People are staying at home and avoiding travel and entertainment. Schools are shutting down. Retirees are losing their investments in stocks. Everyone has been affected to some extent. People panicking and overloading on supplies from grocery stores are making life difficult for others who can't get the essentials like toilet paper.
And there's no end in sight. Some experts predict two months, but they could be overly optimistic. Regardless, two months is a long time for such misery.
Trump didn't cause the coronavirus, but he is being blamed for everything in regards to handling it. He's done an excellent job despite the naysaying from Democrats and the mainstream media. He's taking drastic action.

Cutting off travel from China was the right thing to do, but Trump was accused of being racist. Then, after he did it, they criticized him for not doing it fast enough. But Barack Obama moved far slower than Trump dealing with the swine flu.
And then, when Europe became a hotbed for the virus, as new cases in China dwindled, Trump cut off travel from there. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says 70% of the new cases of the virus are coming from Europe.

Newt Gingrich, who is currently living in Italy, observed, ""When you realize that the current 1,016 deaths in Italy with a population of 60 million would be the equivalent of 5,400 deaths in the United States instead of the 41 deaths we have had so far, you can see what milder, slower and less aggressive responses might have cost in lives.""
Conservative columnist Rachel Marsden described the aggressive steps Russia has taken, which are working there. The country put up ""barriers, closing its border with coronavirus hotbed China in late January, banning high-risk flights, maintaining strict screening at border checkpoints and placing Russian expats evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan in quarantine for three weeks – in Siberia."" As a result, there have been only 17 reported cases of coronavirus, despite 51,000 reported tests.
Democrat Joe Biden attacked Trump's handling of the crisis, then turned around and plagiarized Trump's plan. This comes as no surprise, since Biden has a history of plagiarism. Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for the Trump campaign, said Biden raised the ""vile conspiracy theory that the president purposely allowed the coronavirus to spread."" This is dishonest considering how aggressively Trump has moved to prevent that.
It's the same with falsely accusing Trump of calling the crisis a hoax and not treating it seriously. What he actually said was a criticism of the ""politicizing"" of the coronavirus by Democrats as ""their new hoax.""
Trump's critics fault him no matter what action he takes. Jon Gabriel, the conservative editor of Ricochet, points out how the left criticized Trump for not getting tested for coronavirus right away. But after he got the test, they complained about why he was able to access the test before other people.

Trump's speeches are criticized for either being too ominous or not worried enough, no matter how carefully he tries to walk that fine line between the two approaches.
Mike Huckabee observed, ""So … how has the other side responded? You know, the people with such high standards of 'character' for others? Thus far, they have relentlessly attacked, mocked, criticized, second-guessed and undermined everything Trump has tried to do.""
If the crisis is averted after a couple of months, they'll say Trump didn't stop it fast enough. No matter how many people die, even if a small number, they will say it could have been smaller. Trump can't win. When it's all over, the Democrats will claim everything Trump did was wrong.
These vicious attacks are in contrast to previous outbreaks. The actor James Woods observed, ""I remember the H1N1 and SARS epidemics. Everyone supported our president then. There was no hysteria and the doomsayers kept their mouths shut. Thousands of people died and yet the press supported the astonishingly tepid response by the leaders of the time. Why the hysteria now?""
Advertisement - story continues below
What's sad is liberal networks like CNN and MSNBC are so focused on nitpicking Trump that they are squandering time that could be spent giving people important information about the outbreak.
All the people significantly affected by this crisis – especially those losing working hours – may hold it against Trump. The Democrats of course will say the job interruptions could have been avoided – and that if Trump had started to contain the virus faster, we wouldn't have had to avoid public places and businesses.
What it's going to come down to is: Will Americans believe the Democrats and mainstream media and fault Trump for much of the epidemic, or will they see through the lies and realize he did an excellent job addressing it? It's going to be an uphill battle as the Democrats and media act as an echo chamber for each other. Trump is going to be in the fight of his life.

"Weeks before lockdown, Wuhan authorities downplayed coronavirus","(GLOBE & MAIL) As Chinese authorities widened a massive urban lockdown and flew large numbers of medical personnel to Wuhan, the epicentre of a new SARS-like virus, medical authorities provided new indications that weeks of inaction had allowed the virus to spread widely before serious measures were taken.

Chinese authorities initially reported that the new 2019-nCoV coronavirus had most seriously affected the elderly and those left vulnerable by pre-existing health conditions.

But an academic study published by Chinese researchers in The Lancet on Friday found that of the first 41 confirmed cases of the virus, which causes pneumonia-like symptoms, “less than half had underlying diseases.” Nearly half were 49 years of age or younger. And a third had not been exposed to the wild animal market identified as the source of virus, suggesting that even from the earliest days, it had begun to leap between people.

Mike Rowe: Coronavirus crisis could be 'most compelling case for capitalism that we've seen in our lifetime',"Mike Rowe has spent a career teaching Americans about the important things in life.
On Fox News “Fox & Friends” Monday, the former ""Dirty Jobs"" star said the coronavirus crisis could teach the world about one of the United States’ most important contributions to it -- the inventiveness and adaptability of American capitalism.

While leftist critics such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi plead with President Donald Trump to assume virtually dictatorial powers to deal with the crisis, Rowe pointed out that American businesses are stepping up already.
After co-host Brian Kilmeade asked Rowe what “corporate America” should be doing, Rowe -- an author and veteran television host -- pointed to what’s going on around the country already.
“Obviously, this is not a -- it shouldn't be -- a political thing. And I don't want to make it a political thing,” he said.

“But my answer to your question in general terms is, this virus, we're going to see what capitalism is really all about.
“We have these big conversations about what direction the country is headed and what direction the country ought to be headed. This is a chance, unlike anything I've ever seen, for corporate America to step up and do what the government simply can't do.”

Rowe cited companies such as GM – which last week announced plans to ramp up production of ventilators -- and 3M -- which the financial website StreetInsider reported has doubled its production of respirators – as examples of capitalism responding.
“We have these big conversations about what direction the country is headed and what direction the country ought to be headed,” he said.
“This is a chance, unlike anything I've ever seen, for corporate America to step up and do what the government simply can't do.
“Obviously, the government has the primary role in this, but I don't think they can do it alone.”

Maybe it will be a lesson new generations will learn the way their predecessors did.
It was the U.S. military that defeated the Axis powers on the battlefield in World War II, but it was the world’s greatest industrial plant that supplied the weapons and gear to do it. (And many, many companies and millions of American workers made a lot of money doing it.)
The Cold War was won by a succession of American presidents – most notably Ronald Reagan, of course – but it was the enduring, undeniable economic prowess of the United States as a whole that made their determination possible.
Advertisement - story continues below
The United States is powerful because it is wealthy. And it is wealthy, fundamentally, because of the capitalistic system that so many ignorant souls on the left despise, even as they enjoy its fruits.
Too much reporting in the liberal media took an unseemly glee in noting when the coronavirus crisis drove the stock market below its “Trump Bump,” the point where it started its phenomenal run during his presidency. Do liberals ever ask themselves where the market -- or the American economy -- would be if the country were four years into a Hillary Clinton administration rather than a remarkable period of prosperity?
It shouldn’t be surprising, but it’s still dismaying that the vast majority of social media responses to Rowe were negative, often foul-mouthed, and spewed, doubtless, by exactly the kind of contemptible fools who are too blind to see the reality of the world they’re living in -- the world that's a testament to American capitalism.
As Rowe, an apostle of common sense, put it near the end of his interview:
Advertisement - story continues below
“There are two primary things that are keeping us sane at the moment. ... The people who are bringing us the stuff we need, and the technology that allows us to remain connected as we are right now.”
Both of those things are products – directly and incontrovertibly – of the American capitalistic system. Yet ignorant commenters from the left are using that very technology to criticize Rowe for singing capitalism’s praises.
Rowe is right. Capitalism is already making a compelling case for itself. It’s what’s giving the country the tools to hold the Wuhan coronavirus at bay.
And when it defeats the latest threat, it will have proven itself again.

The nation's many benighted leftists will no doubt miss the lesson – as they’ve missed every other lesson Rowe has taught in his career.
But it’s a good bet the rest of the world will be watching – and learning.

Candidates, for example, are wrong to say Trump has cut the budgets of key agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control.

The coronavirus – 1918 all over again?,"Clusters of a dozen or so deaths may get nonstop ""if-it-bleeds-it-leads"" press coverage. But the lack of preparedness for the really, really big threats may be met with virtual radio silence – until panic breaks out.
The worst, possibly existential, threat is the stealthy, invisible one that multiplies exponentially – in the accurate sense of the term: 400 cases today, 800 tomorrow, then 1,600, 3,200, 6,400, 12,800, 25,600, 51,200, 102,400, 204,800, 409,600, 819,200 and over 1 million after only 12 doubling times. Biological threats proliferate – until they run out of susceptible victims.

In 1918, the great influenza pandemic killed as many people in 11 months as the medieval Black Death did in four years. Ultimately, at least 50 million may have perished. Young healthy people, especially young soldiers headed off to the front in World War I, succumbed quickly. To avoid interfering with the war effort, the U.S. government denied and covered up the threat, preventing the implementation of public health measures.
Since then, the world has gotten smaller. A virus that jumps the species barrier from animals to humans in a meat market in China can cross the Pacific in hours. And despite the expenditure of $80 billion on a National Biologic Defense, the U.S. is arguably no better prepared than it was in 1918, state Steven Hatfill, M.D., and his coauthors in their new book, ""Three Seconds until Midnight.""
As in 1918, we lack a vaccine or wonder drugs, but must rely on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) and on public health authorities to track and try to contain the spread of infection.

Accurate information is critical. Can we trust governmental authorities to tell the truth? Travel restrictions, quarantine, closing businesses and canceling public events have a huge economic and potential political cost.
There can also be incentives to exaggerate the threat in order to sell poorly tested vaccines or drugs. The 1976 swine flu epidemic was almost a non-event; more people were probably injured or even died from adverse effects of the heavily promoted vaccine.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far declined to declare the coronavirus outbreak a global emergency, although cases have been reported in more than a dozen or so countries. China reported only hundreds of ""confirmed"" cases – while countless additional cases were not tested because of lack of diagnostic test kits.
The New England Journal of Medicine writes, ""Another Decade, Another Coronavirus."" This 2019-nCoV virus is the third zoonotic (animal) coronavirus to infect humans in two decades. The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) were contained. Other coronaviruses cause mild cold-like syndromes.
This virus has occasioned the quarantine of entire cities, for the first time since medieval times. This could not be done other than in authoritarian China, states Hatfill, but even there is unlikely to be effective – especially if 5 million people had left before the order was implemented.
The People's Liberation Army has sent 450 medical personnel to Wuhan to help out at local hospitals, which are crammed with patients lying in packed corridors. Construction workers are reportedly trying to build a 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan in five days. The U.S. and other nations are evacuating their citizens from Wuhan.
A report of 41 hospitalized patients in Wuhan, published in The Lancet, showed that patients were relatively young (median age 49), and fewer than half had an underlying illness. Only 66% had been exposed to the Huanan seafood market, the apparent source of the infection. One patient (2%) had no fever; all had pneumonia; 29% had severe respiratory distress syndrome; and 12% had acute cardiac injury. Most cases may be very mild, facilitating more rapid spread.

The coronavirus is transmitted by droplets coming into contact with mucous membranes, including the eye. It can persist on surfaces for days. People without fever or symptoms can transmit the illness during the incubation period, which might be as long as two weeks. At present, definitive diagnostic testing is available only from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
In a severe outbreak, people whose job is not critical may need to stay home. Those who do not have a supply of food, essential medications, or other needed supplies would likely end up in a frantic crowd. Personal protective gear, for people who need to be in contact with the public or care for a sick family member, is already out of stock in medical supply houses. This includes gloves, wrap-around eye protection, and N-95 protective masks – regular surgical masks are probably of little help.
Panic is never helpful; staying calm is always good advice. But failure to heed previous warnings of the need for robust disaster planning, and complacency about medical technology and governmental resources, has set the stage for potential unprecedented disaster.
Individuals need to recognize that they themselves, and not 911 or the emergency room or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, may hold the key to their family's and their community's survival. Local authorities need to know that they may be on their own.

For now, stock up on supplies; cover those coughs and sneezes; wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds; avoid crowds; and stay aware, as the situation could change rapidly.

CNN & MSNBC commentator literally calls for Melania to be infected with coronavirus,"Rick Wilson is a man who, I would presume, is very unemployed these days in his chosen field of Republican political consulting.
This is because, as he notes on his Twitter profile, he's an ""Apostate GOP Media Guy."" If you're wondering what that means, it's pretty much the same grift that people like Ana Navarro and Max Boot have mastered: If you're a former Republican that's done something slightly notable and you've had a change of heart prompted by Trump, you get all sorts of air time.

Say what you will about Navarro and Boot, they were relatively accomplished before they decided to become apostate GOP media people. Rick Wilson was kinda sorta known. I mean, I'd seen him once or twice, somewhere, I think. However, self-promotion and self-reported apostasy have paid off well for Wilson, who's now a not-infrequent guest on CNN and MSNBC. He's also the co-head of the Lincoln Project, a putatively conservative effort to unseat President Trump.
Readers might remember him from a widely criticized appearance in January with CNN's Don Lemon, where Wilson mocked the intelligence President Donald Trump's supporters while Lemon and another guest laughed uproariously.
The frequency of his appearances could reduce in the very near future, however, considering he tweeted that Melania Trump should be infected with coronavirus.

On Wednesday, the White House announced that the first lady would be appearing in a series of public service announcements designed to educate Americans about the ways they can avoid COVID-19 infection.
In a news release, the White House said she would emphasize ""important ways Americans can protect themselves and those most at risk,"" according to CNN.

The outrage over his comments, no. The outrage he displayed with the #BeInfected tweet, yes.
It's difficult to imagine networks aren't going to back away from Wilson, who apparently decided during a pandemic that it was all right to joke that Melania Trump should be a victim of the coronavirus because of her Be Best campaign, or something. Nobody is going to think that's remotely proportional or the work of a man who's looking at this situation in a clear-eyed and somber manner.

Say what you will about Ana Navarro and her nail-filing antics, at least I don't think she'd wish a deadly infection upon anyone.
The same now can't be said for Wilson, which -- one hopes -- is enough to curtail his airtime.
You may remember that Lincoln Project that Wilson is involved in that I mentioned at the outset. In December, Wilson, along with a few other ex-Republican NeverTrumpers -- the curiously married George Conway, along with Steve Schmidt and John Weaver -- co-authored a commentary piece for The New York Times announcing the inception of the organization.
The Lincoln Project, they wrote, is ""an effort to highlight our country’s story and values, and its people’s sacrifices and obligations. This effort transcends partisanship and is dedicated to nothing less than preservation of the principles that so many have fought for, on battlefields far from home and within their own communities.""

Do those principles and values involve jokes about someone getting coronavirus as the entire country gets put on pause to avoid a second coming of the 1918 influenza outbreak? I mean, I understand they're two different arenas, but a lot of Wilson's talk is about ""principles."" That's why, he implies, principled individuals can't support the current president.
If only he had enough principles not to call for the first lady to be infected in the middle of a pandemic lockdown.

GOP: Pelosi's 'ideological wish list' blocking coronavirus relief,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at a news conference Jan. 17, 2019 (video screenshot)
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are using the coronavirus pandemic to help fulfill their ""ideological wish list,"" stalling a $1 trillion emergency package of relief for struggling businesses and families, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell charged Monday on the Senate floor.
Advertisement - story continues below
The two sides failed to reach an agreement Sunday night on the ""Phase 3"" relief package, which includes a $1,200 rebate check for most taxpayers, along with $500 for each of their children living at home. It also features help for small businesses and large corporations.
Republicans, needing 60 votes to move forward on the bill, got no Democratic votes Sunday night. Five GOP senators were not present because they tested positive for the coronavirus and are under quarantine.
McConnell said that as the economy nosedives, putting the welfare of businesses and individuals at risk, Democrats are pushing measures from their radical Green New Deal, trying, among other things, to extract concessions from airlines over their ""carbon footprint.""

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

""They ought to be embarrassed. This is no time for this nonsense,"" he said.
Earlier Sunday, McConnell said the bill had support from ""a lot of rank-and-file Democrats who were involved in drafting it.""
Advertisement - story continues below
However, a senior Republican aide told Fox News that on Sunday night, a ""last-minute list of demands from Pelosi's and Schumer's ideological wish list are coming into focus.""
""Not only are these completely unrelated to the coronavirus epidemic, they could prevent companies from participating in the loan programs altogether—directly causing unnecessary layoffs,"" the aide said.
Along with increased fuel emission standards for airlines, Democrats are seeking unprecedented collective bargaining powers for unions, and expanded wind and solar tax credits.
Pelosi, Schumer 'willing to risk your life'
Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., confirmed on Twitter Monday morning that Pelosi and Schumer ""are willing to risk your life, your job, your retirement savings for a radical, left-wing wish list that has nothing to do with this virus. Disgraceful.""
Advertisement - story continues below
Following McConnell's remarks Monday, Schumer charged Republicans are trying to create a ""slush fund"" for corporations and aren't doing enough to help workers and health care providers.
The Democratic leader insisted Democrats are negotiating in good faith for the benefit of the nation.
Just after midnight last night, Schumer told reporters there were ""some serious problems with the bill leader McConnell laid down.""
""Huge amounts of corporate bailout funds without restrictions or without oversight -- you wouldn't even know who is getting the money. Not enough money for hospitals, nurses, PPE, masks, all the health care needs. No money for state and local government, many of whom would go broke. Many other things,"" the Democratic leader said.

But Republicans are pointing to the words of House Majority Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn, who told colleagues in a conference call last Thursday the coronavirus crisis is ""a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.""
'Laundry list'
McConnell said the emergency bill ""is not about unrelated policy changes.""
It's about ""direct assistance to the American people,"" he said, ""and to small businesses and to hospitals and others who are in need because we in government at all levels, in order to deal with this pandemic, have basically shut the economy down.""

Pelosi, after returning to Washington after a weeklong House recess, came with a ""laundry list"" of demands unrelated to the crisis, the Republican aide said, including wiping out up to $10,000 in student loan debt per person and election-security funding.

Trump Cabinet Bible leader blames coronavirus on God's 'wrath'," 

Advertisement - story continues below
A minister who has been leading a weekly Bible-study group for members of President Trump's Cabinet has posted online his belief that amid the coronavirus, America is not experiencing God's ""forsaking wrath"" but, rather, his ""consequential wrath.""
""Some leading evangelicals believe and teach that America is now experiencing God's judgment,"" wrote Ralph Drollinger, a former NBA player and the founder of Capitol Ministries, which provides Bible studies, evangelism and discipleship to political leaders.
""If that is the case, as a public servant who is sacrificing so much in your attempt to turn our nation around, it would stand to reason – if those evangelical leaders are correct – that you are wasting your time. Are you laboring against a foregone conclusion? I think not. But let me qualify that: I do not believe America is experiencing the forsaking wrath of God, but yes, America is experiencing the consequential wrath of God,"" he wrote March 21 in a preface to his Bible study on the subject.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

In the study, Drollinger explains the Bible is full of examples showing that the satisfaction of God's violated justice is His judgment, but that is balanced – ""often placated"" – by His mercy.
But Drollinger raises the prospect of mercy being ""expended.""
Advertisement - story continues below
""Since God is just and sin must and will be paid for, wrath—the righteousness of God revealed against sin—is an inevitable consequence,"" he said.
He listed five forms of God's judgment, including eternal wrath (hell), eschatological wrath (the day of the Lord) and cataclysmic wrath (Sodom & Gomorrah).
Then there is the forsaking wrath (removing restraint) and consequential wrath (sowing and reaping).
Drollinger concludes that America is facing consequential wrath, pointing out it's not the same as the punishment of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Old Testament cities destroyed by fire from the heavens over their homosexuality.
""In fact to the contrary, America today is populated by tens of millions of faithful followers of Christ!"" he wrote. ""Many are those who have glibly postured, 'If God does not judge America, then he owes Sodom and Gomorrah an apology!' But such thinking fails to take into account what went on between Abraham and God in Genesis 18:22–33 before He judged Sodom and Gomorrah!""

Drollinger wrote:
Abraham, if he were to plead with God for America, would have a much stronger case than he did pleading with God for Sodom and Gomorrah. In fact, today’s America is not by in large characterized by people who are unfaithful to God’s precepts. Conversely, there is only a small minority of individuals who are grossly disobedient to God.
Unfortunately for the vast majority of faithful individuals in America, too many of the unfaithful have been allowed by the faithful to gain high positions of influence in our culture: high positions in our government, our educational system, our media and our entertainment industry. This is tragic, unfortunate, and costly.
Those individuals who are rebuked by God’s forsaking wrath are largely responsible for God’s consequential wrath on our nation.
Advertisement - story continues below
That needs to change—and that is something we can change with God’s help! What is a great encouragement to me, ministering here in our nation’s capital, is witnessing the groundswell of faithful individuals who have been voted into office. If my calculations are correct, and I believe they are, there are more believers in Congress and the executive branch now than at any other time in modern American history! And they are beginning to reach a tipping point!
He predicted: ""I think great days lie ahead for our country as more and more evangelicals rise in their influence—you godly public servants— who are working so hard to deliver us from the consequential wrath we are undergoing as a nation due in large part to the misdirection of those who are rebuked by God’s forsaking wrath.""
He cited a verse in Proverbs that states, ""When the righteous increase, the people rejoice, But when a wicked man rules, people groan.""
Investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald's publication The Intercept said Drollinger's ""evangelical lessons are carefully catered to conservative ideology, with a focus on interpreting current events through a partisan lens.""

The study meets every Wednesday with members of Trump's Cabinet, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Health Secretary Alex Azar.
The report said another 52 Republican lawmakers have taken part in Drollinger's Capitol Hill Bible study.

He continued: ""Well, we’ve come to accept that without panicking about it, without demanding scalps. We’ve just come to accept it because we intellectually have accepted what the flu is. So if this virus ends up being no more lethal than that, then we have a baseline, then we know that it’s not gonna be that much more contagious.

It was a plan viewed unfavorably by a number of skeptics within the Senate Republican ranks, many of whom found themselves voting to pass the bill Tuesday, however, due in no small part to a verbal whipping from Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Testing is generally conducted at hospitals, but drive-thru testing is being implemented in states like New York.
According to Fox News, only individuals expressing symptoms and approved by their doctor or medical professional are being prioritized for testing. Many asymptomatic individuals potentially exposed to the virus have been turned away and told to continue self-quarantining in order to prevent testing shortages.
""The testing process has been difficult,” disease and prescription specialist Dr. Azadeh Shirazi told the outlet. “Initially the test kits were flawed, and burdensome rules and strict criteria contributed to hospitals and doctors struggling to test widely for the coronavirus. These delays have made it impossible to get a true picture of the outbreak.”
""There are enough tests at hospitals and designated facilities for those that are symptomatic,” Shirazi said.

“The challenge is testing those who have come into contact with someone who has it but they’re not symptomatic.
The president has echoed similar fears in recent days, telling reporters in a White House news briefing Thursday that Americans should listen to their doctor's word on the matter of testing.
""People who don’t show symptoms and whose doctors say they don’t need it, I would rely on that,"" Trump said.

The aid, if received, would be the industry’s first broad bailout since the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. It is also the clearest sign yet of the financial damage coronavirus and the draconian measures governments are taking to stop it are having on American businesses.

What the coronavirus should teach us,"As the markets have plummeted over global fears surrounding the fallout from the new coronavirus, political pundits have taken up the call: Find some meaning in the coronavirus outbreak and response. And where there is a demand for speculative opinion, there's never a shortage of supply. Thus we've seen the coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China, be blamed on President Donald Trump. We've seen government-managed response, which has varied widely in terms of success by country, touted as a final rebuttal of libertarian precepts. We've seen the coronavirus' economic impact cited as a rationale for breaking global supply chains and pursuing industrial autarky instead.
None of these takeaways are particularly compelling. The Trump administration's response has been about as strong as prior federal attempts to deal with public epidemics, ranging from SARS to swine flu. While Trump himself hasn't exactly projected a sense of calming administrative competence, those around him, ranging from Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, are fully capable of performing as needed. Libertarianism does not suggest that collective action ought to be out of bounds in the case of public emergencies with serious externalities – few libertarians oppose police departments or proper environmental regulations, for example – and the record of government competence has been, at best, rather mixed. The solution to vulnerable supply chains running through authoritarian countries is, first, for Western countries to consider security threats when formulating trade policy, and second, for companies to harden their supply chains by diversifying those chains even further.

So, what are the real lessons to be learned from the coronavirus?
First, we should favor governments that are transparent in their distribution of information. China has been celebrated for its extraordinary crackdown on public life, which has brought transmissions down dramatically. But if it were not for China's propagandistic efforts to quash news about the coronavirus in the first place, the epidemic probably would not have become a pandemic. 
Second, we must stop humoring anti-scientific rumor-mongering about issues like vaccines. The curbing of the coronavirus will be reliant on the development of a vaccine, and Americans should understand that vaccines work, and that misinformation about vaccinations should generally be rejected.

TRENDING: 2 Fox stars gave Donna Brazile lesson in manners after outrageous 'Go to hell' comment

Third, we should remember that crises exacerbate underlying issues; they rarely create them. Economic volatility in the aftermath of the coronavirus has merely exposed the underlying weaknesses of the Chinese and European economies; those systemic problems won't be solved through Band-Aid solutions. The public health issues with homelessness will likely be exposed dramatically in the United States; they won't go away when the coronavirus ends. The coronavirus should underscore the necessity for action in the absence of crisis.
Finally, we should remember that charity and local community support matter. Large-scale government response will never be as efficient or as personal as local response. Care for our neighbors. Care for our families. Implement personal behavior that lowers risk. And then wait for more information. Perhaps that's the best lesson from all of this: Jumping to conclusions based on lack of information is a serious mistake.

""While the virus has not yet hit hard in the United States, government officials and health agencies have enacted response plans, corporations are halting travel abroad, and education leaders are grappling with what a widespread domestic outbreak of the virus could mean for schoolchildren,"" FEE said.
FEE said it's ""unfortunate that it takes a viral epidemic to spotlight the many alternatives to conventional K-12 schooling.""
""Not only is homeschooling widely popular in the U.S., educating approximately two million children nationwide, but other schooling alternatives, such as virtual learning, micro-schooling, and hybrid homeschooling continue to sprout.""
Among the wide range of alternatives to sitting in a classroom, American students have access to programs such as the Florida Virtual School, established in 1997 as the first fully online public high school.
Micro-schools, the report said, are small, home-based, multi-age facilities that ""act like a one-room schoolhouse."" An Arizona program, Prenda, FEE said, already has 80 such facilities serving about 550 students.

""Like micro-schools, hybrid homeschooling programs and small, community-based classes for homeschoolers are also gaining popularity and may be swept into the limelight if conventional schools are forced to temporarily close,"" said FEE.
""Operating with small, age-mixed groups of children, these hybrid models and classes offer an alternative to institutional schooling, avoiding large classrooms and crowded buildings.""
The organization found: ""These emerging learning options outside of traditional schooling show not only that 'mass homeschooling' is possible but also that it may be highly desirable. Personalized learning, small group interactions that build community and connection, and education without the coercion inherent in standard schooling are beneficial whether or not a pending epidemic is what exposes families to these education possibilities.""

At the opening of the briefing, Biden had to be reminded by his staff that the conference had begun.
