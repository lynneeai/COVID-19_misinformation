Dr. Brownstein: COVID-19 is Much Less Deadly than the Common Flu,"       

Coronavirus XI: What the Hell is Going On? The Fear Should Stop!
by David Brownstein, M.D.
DrBrownstein.com
I cannot understand why we are in a police state atmosphere right now. Over 99% of those that contract COVID-19 will recover from it.
Folks, I am not minimizing this illness. COVID-19 is something to take seriously. It is highly contagious and spreads quickly.
Yes, it causes respiratory failure and death in those most susceptible: the elderly and those with chronic health conditions including diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and lung disorders.
We may not even have enough respirators for those who have a serious case.
However, there is another side to this story that is not being told.
Did you know that COVID-19 is much less deadly than the common flu? Let me explain.
During this flu season (2019-2020) 1,130,489 samples have been collected. The number of positive influenza samples is 231,654 (20.5%). (1) “The CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 38 million flu illnesses, 390,000 hospitalizations and 23,000 deaths from flu.
So, 23,000 deaths from the flu out of 231,654 positive specimens means that the death rate from influenza (as of 3.20.2020) is 10% (23,000/231,654).
Do we close the country for this? Do we declare a lockdown of our states because 10% are dying from the flu?
No. We go to work and live our lives.
Let’s look at the numbers for COVID-19 starting with the worst-affected countries China and Italy. (2)
In China there are 80,967 confirmed cases and 3,248 deaths. That results in a mortality rate of 4%.
In Italy, there are 47,021 confirmed cases and 4032 deaths. That results in an 8% death rate.
In the US, we have 19,007 confirmed cases and 250 deaths. That is a death rate of 1.3%. (Note: the death rate in the US is falling as more tests are confirmed as I stated would happen in previous posts.)
Let’s look at these results and compare them to the 2020 influenza death rate in the Table below.
 
Folks, we have shuttered our country quarantining the entire population. The economy is a mess. People who need to work can’t. Our president has accessed emergency powers.
One bright spot is that at least a few Senators cashed in and sold their stocks before the crash. Good for them. (Of course, repeat that last line with lots of sarcasm.)
COVID-19 is overwhelming our hospitals because we had no master plan in place for a pandemic. That is a massive failure by the Federal Government. Heads should roll for this as I have been saying since the beginning.
So what’s the good news?
The good news is that you can let the fear go. This virus is not deadly to the vast majority—over 99%– who get it. In fact, I propose at the end of this nightmare, the death rate will be much lower than the common flu that many of us suffer from.
Kids and young people are not dying from it in droves. As I have stated previously, in the end, when all the testing is done, I predict the death rate will be below 1%.
In my last blog post I provided you with effective natural therapies—vitamins A, C, D and iodine– that have proven to me and my partners to be effective at minimizing viral infections.
Furthermore, a Chinese study on IV vitamin C showed that it was 100% effective at treating moderate to severe coronavirus infections.   I will discuss that in my next post. (Note: The IV vitamin C study was supposed to be this post, but I have become very irritated with what has happened in our country and wanted to help alleviate the fear that is so prevalent.)
At my office, the Center for Holistic Medicine has five practitioners. None of us can recall a patient who died from influenza or pneumonia this season or in any of the last few seasons. Our patients get viral infections like everyone else. We treat them with the therapies I outlined for you before along with IV vitamin C, IV hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and other therapies. We have so much to offer sick, infected patients.
IV vitamin C should be given to every hospitalized COVID-19 patient–as well as anyone hospitalized with influenza, pneumonia, sepsis, et cetera.
If you don’t have a holistic doctor, it is time to find one. Conventional medicine has little to offer sick COVID-19 patients. My partners and I have a lot to offer.
Final Thoughts
As we increase our testing, the mortality rate for COVID-19 will fall. The final number will be much lower than the annual flu mortality rate number shown in the Table. There will be more illness and deaths from this virus, no doubt. However the fear level is well out of proportion to the problems we are seeing with COVID-19.
Take your vitamins. Eat a healthy diet free of refined sugar. Stay hydrated. Exercise. Don’t let the media and our Government cloud your thinking. Look at the numbers.
FDR said it best:
“The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”
COVID-19 deserves our attention and vigilance. It does not deserve the fear to ruin our country. We need to make our voices heard. The politicians need to hear from everyone of us. Remember, they work for us even if they don’t think so.
To All Our Health,
~DrB
Addendum: In previous posts, I wrote that the flu death rate is o.1% as reported by the CDC. That number fluctuates each flu season. It is based on an estimate of the number of flu-infected Americans. The 10% number is based on confirmed cases of the flu as I showed you above. COVID-19 is currently being reported on confirmed cases. It is inappropriate to compare COVID-19 death rates with estimated CDC flu rate numbers. A direct comparison is done by using actual confirmed flu and COVID-19 cases which I have done in this post.

Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus,"       

by Andrew W. Saul, Editor
Orthomolecular Medicine News Service
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
(OMNS January 26, 2020) The coronavirus pandemic can be dramatically slowed, or stopped, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C.
Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.
It is very important to maximize the body’s anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness.
But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.
“I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.” (Robert F. Cathcart, MD)
The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:
Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams (or more) daily, in divided doses.
Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. (Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000)
Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form)
Zinc: 20 mg daily
Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily
Vitamin C [1], Vitamin D [2], magnesium [3], zinc [4], and selenium [5] have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.
The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C’s early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s.[6] Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980.[7]
It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?

Ozone Treatment: A Real Remedy for the Coronavirus Panic,"       

A Plausible “Penny” Costing Effective Treatment for Corona Virus – Ozone Therapy
by Robert Jay Rowen, MD1, and Howard Robins, DPM
Journal of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology
Abstract
Many viruses require reduced sulfhydryl groups for cell fusion and entry. Corona viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of the condition now named coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19), are rich in cysteine, which residues must be intact for viral activity. Sulfhydryl groups are vulnerable to oxidation.
Ozone therapy, a very inexpensive and safe modality may safely exploit this critical vulnerability in many viruses, inclusive of SARS-CoV-2.

Does Coronavirus have a soft “underbelly” leaving it vulnerable to a simple treatment?
by Dr. Robert Rowen, MD
As I write this, the world is in a state of panic over non-stop news reports and government lock downs across the globe over the spreading COVID-19 disease, caused by a “novel” strain of coronavirus (now termed SARS-CoV-2). Tragically, what the news reports fail to convey is that you have the means to protect yourself and your loved ones with a “novel” treatment one can do at home.

Medical Doctor Complains that He Cannot Test His Patients for Coronavirus Because CDC will Not Provide Same Test Kits Used in Other Countries,"       

Coronavirus Part V: The Epic Failure at The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention
by David Brownstein, M.D.
DrBrownstein.com
I just finished a busy week seeing patients. During this time, I saw at least six patients who had flu-like illnesses.
Did they have COVID-19? I don’t know.
Why don’t I know? I can’t tell my patients if the are sick with coronavirus because there are no test kits available to me.
However, test kits are widely available in many other countries including Iran, Japan, South Korea, Germany, or China. In fact, hundreds of thousands of coronavirus tests have been run in other countries.
But, NOT in the US.
As of Monday, March 2, 2020, the US has tested a few hundred people for coronavirus. According to the CDC, 337 more kits were released on Tuesday and Wednesday this week.
Why are other countries able to test for coronavirus and we aren’t?!?!
When the coronavirus epidemic started late last year in China, the World Health Organization (WHO), with help from German researchers, quickly developed a test for coronavirus. This is the test used by every other country except…the US.
“The CDC insisted that only its test–and not the one developed by the WHO, for example–could be used on suspected cases, and even CDC tests would [only] be administered under limited circumstances.” (1)
Folks, this is an unmitigated disaster! How do we know how many people are infected with coronavirus if we can’t test them? It feels almost idiotic to ask that question.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are a perfect example of a FAILED Federal agency. On the CDC homepage it is stated that the CDC
“Is working 24/7 to protect America from health and safety threats both foreign and domestic.” (2)
The coronavirus pandemic illustrates the failure of the CDC to properly do its job. And, because of that, we suffer.
In the US, we spend almost 18% of our GNP on healthcare. This is markedly higher than any other Western country. Yet, we are last or nearly last in every health indicator. We are last in neonatal mortality and we live shorter lives when compared to every other major Western country.
We are clearly getting cheated when it comes to healthcare. And, the CDC is very good at cheating us. They cheated us by stealing $1 billion dollars for the Zika non-epidemic. Now, they will get paid handsomely for their missteps with coronavirus.
You see, the CDC is supposed to protect us from viral pandemics and epidemics. Yet, in the case of COVID-19, because of a lack of testing kits, we have no idea how many are infected with coronavirus.
Furthermore, COVID-19 could have been a perfect example of our public health system working: a new virus is identified and contained through proper quarantining and treatment.
Well, those days are long gone. This virus is clearly spreading out of control due to the ineptitude of the CDC. No longer can it be maintained.
But, I have good news for the CDC. Our Federal legislatures, in true fashion, have approved over $8 billion for US Governmental agencies dealing with virus. The inept CDC gets $2.2 billion.
Wow. They made out better than they did with Zika. What a DEAL!
I am sure this money will be well spent.
Why would we give more money to the agency that failed epically? Will anyone at the CDC lose their job over this failure?  I doubt it. At my lecture on Saturday, I will talk more about this.
Final Thoughts
1.  I predict the mortality rate for coronavirus will be much lower than the 2-3% currently reported.  Once we are able to test everyone, there will be many more asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic coronavirus patients that will lower the mortality rate.  The mortality rate will be somewhere near the influenza mortality rate. Keep in mind that coronavirus has been around for nearly 100 years. It causes a flu-like or an upper respiratory illness (a cold).  We have all been getting and recovering from coronavirus infections for nearly a century or more.
2.  My experience in treating patients for viral infections has shown that vitamins A, C, D as well as iodine & nutritional IVs are very effective. Not only do these protocols help to prevent infections, but they also help to recover from them. I suggest working with a holistic doctor who is skilled with nutritional IVs. They can provide you with antiviral therapies that work. At the Center for Holistic Medicine we have been doing nutritional IV therapies for well over 25 years. We have been ready to treat viral infections, like coronavirus, for over 25 years.

New York Hospitals Treating Coronavirus Patients with Vitamin C,"       

By Lorena Mongelli and Bruce Golding
New York Post
Excerpts:
Seriously sick coronavirus patients in New York state’s largest hospital system are being given massive doses of vitamin C — based on promising reports that it’s helped people in hard-hit China, The Post has learned.
Dr. Andrew G. Weber, a pulmonologist and critical-care specialist affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, said his intensive-care patients with the coronavirus immediately receive 1,500 milligrams of intravenous vitamin C.
Identical amounts of the powerful antioxidant are then readministered three or four times a day, he said.
Each dose is more than 16 times the National Institutes of Health’s daily recommended dietary allowance of vitamin C, which is just 90 milligrams for adult men and 75 milligrams for adult women.
The regimen is based on experimental treatments administered to people with the coronavirus in Shanghai, China, Weber said.
“The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C,” he said.
“It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it’s not a sexy drug.”
A spokesman for Northwell — which operates 23 hospitals, including Lenox Hill Hospital on Manhattan’s Upper East Side — said vitamin C was being “widely used” as a coronavirus treatment throughout the system, but noted that medication protocols varied from patient to patient.

The National Plan to Vaccinate Every American – National Registry to Record Everyone’s Vaccination Status,"       

The National Plan to Vaccinate Every American
by Barbara Loe Fisher
National Vaccine Information Center
Scientists at the National Institutes of Health are working with a biotech company to quickly start clinical trials of an experimental messenger RNA vaccine and fast track it to licensure. [1]
The FDA has not yet licensed messenger RNA vaccines that use part of the RNA of a virus to manipulate the body’s immune system into stimulating a potent immune response. [2, 3]
It looks like the coronavirus vaccine will be the first genetically engineered messenger RNA vaccine to be fast tracked to licensure, just like Gardasil was the first genetically engineered virus-like particle vaccine to be fast tracked to licensure. [4, 5]
There likely will be lots of questions about whether the fast tracked coronavirus vaccine was studied long enough to adequately demonstrate safety, especially for people who have trouble resolving strong inflammatory responses in their bodies and may be at greater risk for vaccine reactions.[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
However, there is no question about what will happen if the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) [11, 12] recommends that all Americans get the newly licensed coronavirus vaccine.
The government has a National Vaccine Plan. It is a Plan designed to make sure you, your child and everyone in America gets every dose of every vaccine that government officials recommend now and in the future.

1986-1996: Establishing & Creating The Plan
Established under the 1986 National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act during the Reagan Administration, [13] the Plan didn’t really get traction until Congress funded the Vaccines for Children program in 1993 under the Clinton Administration [14, 15] and gave the Department of Health and Human Services authority to fund a network of state-based electronic vaccine tracking registries [16] that can monitor the vaccination histories of children without the informed consent of their parents.
In 1995, then Secretary of Health Donna Shalala used rule-making authority to authorize the Social Security Administration to disclose the social security number of every baby born in the country to state governments without parental consent.[17]
Federal officials explained that – quote –
“public health program uses of the social security numbers would include, but are not limited to, establishing immunization registries” and that new routine use of social security numbers would help the government operate “a national network of coordinated statewide immunization registries.” [18]
By 1996, when Congress established a national Electronic Health Records (EHR) system under HIPPA, [19] the stage had been set for a government-operated electronic surveillance system to monitor the personal medical records and vaccination status of all Americans. [20, 21, 22, 23]  
The justification for this big data grab by the government, which clearly violated the privacy of Americans, was to- quote – “protect the public by reducing disease.”
Nationwide Electronic Health Records & Vaccine Tracking Systems
Today, the nationwide federally funded Electronic Health Records system captures the details of every visit you make to a doctor’s office, hospital, pharmacy, laboratory or other medical facility; every medical diagnosis you get; every drug you have been prescribed and every vaccine you accept or refuse.
Your Electronic Health Record can be accessed not only by government health agencies like the Social Security Administration, Medicaid and federal and state health and law enforcement agencies, [24, 25] but also can be shared with authorized third parties such as doctors, health insurance companies, HMOs and other corporations, hospitals, labs, nursing homes and medical researchers. [26, 27, 28]

A new Health Information Exchange [29, 30, 31] initiative funded by the government will make it even easier for computerized health and vaccine records databases to tag, track down and sanction Americans who do not go along with the National Vaccine Plan in the future.  [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]
What Happened to the Plan’s Duty to Prevent Adverse Reactions to Vaccines?
Ironically, when Congress directed the Department of Health and Human Services to create a National Vaccine Program in the 1986 Act, federal health officials were told to put together a Plan to – quote –
“achieve optimal prevention of human infectious diseases through immunization and to achieve optimal prevention against adverse reactions to vaccines.” [39]
The Plan was not supposed to focus solely on vaccine development and promotion but to equally focus on preventing vaccine reactions.
Yet, in the very first 1994 National Vaccine Plan only four out of 25 “objectives” and only two out of 14 anticipated “outcomes” addressed preventing vaccine reactions. [40]
The 2010 version of the Plan [41] also largely ignored the legal duty of HHS to conduct vaccine safety research to fill in long standing knowledge gaps and take steps to make vaccines and vaccine policies less likely to cause harm. [42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]
Looking back, it appears Congress was not really committed to funding research and creating substantive initiatives to reduce vaccine risks, regardless of what was stated in the 1986 Act, or there would been congressional oversight and federal agencies would have been directed to follow the law rather than ignore it for more than 30 years. [53]
Government’s Vaccine Marketing Plan for the Pharmaceutical Industry
Instead, government agencies have brazenly forged lucrative public private business partnerships with the pharmaceutical industry and the medical establishment to:
develop many new vaccines; [54, 55, 56, 57]
increase public demand for vaccines; [58]
raise vaccination rates among children to nearly 100 percent; [59]
create and expand electronic vaccine tracking registries; [60, 61, 62, 63, 64] and
promote global vaccination programs, [65, 66] even though the primary purpose of the 1986 Act was to reduce vaccine reactions and protect the U.S. childhood vaccine supply, [67] not fund and expand global vaccination programs.
In fact, federal health officials accurately characterize the U.S. vaccination system in the 21st century as a business. A decade ago they admitted that – quote –
“The 2010 National Vaccine Plan provides a vision for the U.S. vaccine and immunization enterprise for the next decade.” [68]
That’s because they know the National Vaccine Plan is really a Vaccine Marketing Plan for the pharmaceutical industry. [69, 70, 71, 72]

So, if you are wondering why many states are trying to pass laws eliminating all vaccine exemptions and mandate every vaccine the pharmaceutical industry produces and the CDC recommends, [73, 74, 75, 76] you don’t have to look any further than the government’s well-financed National Vaccine Plan.
Implementation of The Plan Accelerated in 2011
Implementation of the Plan was accelerated in 2011 after the U.S. Supreme Court declared FDA licensed vaccines to be –quote – “unavoidably unsafe” for the purpose of removing almost all remaining liability from drug companies when vaccines hurt people. [77, 78]
Since 2011, two powerful CDC-appointed vaccine advisory committees influenced by members associated with the pharmaceutical and medical trade industries – the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) [79, 80, 81, 82, 83] and the National Vaccine Advisory Committee (NVAC) [84, 85, 86] – have been busy coming up with new ways to meet strategic goals of the National Vaccine Plan.
When highly publicized cases of measles were reported in California’s Disneyland in 2015 [87] and in New York in 2019, [88, 89] with military precision pursuit of the Plan was kicked into even high gear. [90, 91]
During the past five years, California, Vermont, New York, Maine and Hawaii have lost vaccine exemptions, even though tens of thousands of Americans rose up in protest. [92]
In 2019, the people managed to hold on to exemptions in states like Oregon, Arizona and New Jersey [93] but this year, bills to force vaccine use are already threatening parental, civil and human rights in Virginia, Massachusetts, Florida, Washington, Pennsylvania and more. [94]

Five Main Types of Vaccine Laws Being Proposed in States
These are the five main types of laws being proposed in the states and your state may be one of them:
Number One:  State laws that eliminate all personal belief vaccine exemptions allowing you to follow your conscience or religious beliefs and make it illegal for physicians to grant a medical exemption unless it strictly conforms to very narrow CDC-approved contraindications to vaccination. 
National vaccine coverage rates among school children are at 95 percent for core vaccines like polio, pertussis, measles and chickenpox, yet, government health officials are not satisfied. [95]
They have narrowed vaccine contraindications so that almost no medical history or health condition qualifies as a reason for a medical exemption. [96]
If you or your child have had previous vaccine reactions, are vaccine injured, have a brother or sister who was injured or died after vaccination, or are suffering with a brain or immune system disorder that the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) does not consider to be a contraindication to vaccination, states like California [97, 98] are denying physicians the right to exercise professional judgment and give children a medical exemption to vaccination are threatening human rights. [99]
No wonder less than one percent of vaccine reactions are ever reported to the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System [100] and doctors feel free to discriminate against and deny medical care to anyone who is not vaccinated according to CDC schedules. [101]
Laws that eliminate medical, religious and conscience exemptions to vaccination and ban citizens from getting a school education – even a college education – do violate civil and human rights and so do vaccine mandates by employers who fire or refuse to hire workers based on their vaccination status. [102, 103, 104]
The two professions being targeted first for workplace vaccine mandates are healthcare [105, 106, 107] and childcare workers, [108, 109] but they certainly will not be the last. [110]

Number Two:  State laws that turn unelected members of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices into de facto lawmakers and automatically mandate all current and future federally recommended vaccines without any public discussion or vote by duly elected state legislators.
Under the U.S. Constitution, state legislatures hold the majority of power to pass public health laws, so vaccine laws are state laws. [111, 112]
If states hand that constitutional authority over to an unelected federal government committee, the people no longer can work through their elected state representatives to make sure laws do not force involuntary medical risk taking and punish citizens exercising civil and human rights. [113]
It is clear that Pharma and medical trade lobbyists partnering with government officials to implement the National Vaccine Plan are unhappy they have to spend so much time and money trying to strong arm state legislators into mandating every CDC recommended vaccine.
At the same time, some politicians are not happy that a growing number of Americans are showing up in state Capitols to oppose oppressive vaccine mandates.
Today, it costs a staggering $3,000 to give a child every one of the 69 doses of 16 vaccines on the federal government’s schedule. [114]
In addition to coronavirus vaccine, there are more than a dozen experimental vaccines being fast tracked to market for TB, influenza, HIV/AIDS, gonorrhea, herpes simplex, strep A and B, e-coli, RSV, salmonella, and malaria, [115] with several hundred more being developed in a global vaccine market estimated to balloon to nearly $100 billion by 2026. [116, 117]
State laws that automatically mandate all federally recommended vaccines are handing Big Pharma a big blank check and putting an unknown number of vaccine vulnerable children and adults at risk for serious health problems if they are forced to use every one of them. [118, 119, 120, 121, 122]
Number Three: State laws that allow doctors to declare minor children mentally competent to consent to vaccination so children can be vaccinated without the knowledge of their parents.
There is plenty of scientific evidence that children’s brains are not developed enough before or during teenage years to support rational benefit and risk decision-making, especially if they are subjected to pressure. [123, 124]
Giving doctors the legal authority to, in effect, go behind parents’ backs and persuade a minor child to get liability free vaccines violates the legal right of parents to consent to medical interventions performed on their children. [125]
It also puts vaccine vulnerable children at greater risk for suffering reactions. [126]
Parents know their child’s personal and family medical history best and if parents are left in the dark, not only are they blocked from preventing vaccine reactions but there is no way for them to monitor a child after vaccination for signs of reactions so they can immediately take their child for treatment. [127]

Number Four: State laws requiring schools to publicly post vaccine coverage rates for the purpose of shaming schools that allow students with vaccine exemptions to receive a school education.
Publicly posting school vaccination rates and numbers of students with exemptions creates a hostile community environment by targeting certain schools and families, whose children have vaccine exemptions, for discrimination and abuse. [128, 129, 130]
It is an illusion that some schools are safer based on vaccination rates.
For example, even schools with 100 percent vaccination rates and zero exemptions have had outbreaks of pertussis [131] and schools with very high vaccination rates have had outbreaks of measles and mumps. [132, 133]
That is because vaccinated children and adults can get infected with and transmit infectious diseases but sometimes show few or no symptoms and are never diagnosed or reported. [134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140]
Children and teachers interact with many other vaccinated and unvaccinated people outside of the school setting. It is discriminatory to require public posting of the numbers of healthy students with vaccine exemptions, when schools are not required to publicly post the numbers of students who are infected with transmissible diseases like hepatitis B and C, HIV, streptococcal, mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus, e-coli, Fifths disease, herpes simplex and more.
Number Five: State laws that operate vaccine tracking registries and integrate them into Electronic Health Records systems without the consent of those being tracked.
The National Vaccine Information Center has a two-decade public record of opposing the creation of national or state based electronic surveillance systems that automatically enroll children and adults without their informed consent to monitor their vaccination status and health histories. [141]
Not only have there been past security breaches with electronic databases dumping personally identifying information into the public domain, [142] but there is legitimate concern that the government should not be conducting electronic surveillance on citizens while pursuing a National Vaccine Plan that encourages punitive societal sanctions, such as the inability to get a school education or a job, for individuals who refuse to go along with the Plan.
Learn About Federal & State Government Police Powers to Compel Vaccine Use
For more information on the history and types of public health laws that allow the federal government and states to use police powers to compel vaccine use, go to NVIC’s website at NVIC.org. [143, 144]
To learn more about vaccine legislation pending in your state and talking points you can use to educate your legislators, go to NVIC Advocacy.org and become a user of NVIC’s free online Advocacy Portal.
You will be put into direct contact with your own state and federal representatives and sent emails when bills that threaten or expand your freedom to make voluntary vaccine choices are moving in your state so you can make your voice heard, including showing up at scheduled public hearings.
Making Government Work for Us
In America, we are governed by laws that the representatives we elect make, so it is important to vet all candidates for positions on issues you care about before going to the polls. Good laws can be enacted and bad laws can be repealed but only if we wake up, stand up and actively participate to make our representative government work for us.
Already this year, there have been more than 50 good bills introduced in a number of states that defend voluntary vaccine choices. This is a time for positive action.
It’s your health. Your family. Your choice.

Doctors Avoid Hand Washing Despite Evidence It is Best Way to Reduce Infections,"       

by Barbara Cáceres
The Vaccine Reaction
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been urging everyone to thoroughly and frequently wash their hands since reports of the coronavirus outbreak in China, highlighting the long recognized practice of hand washing as a tried and true infection control measure.1
A little known fact is that among all health care providers, physicians are known to be the most reluctant to wash their hands while caring for patients.2
Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis first observed in 1846 that when physicians washed their hands between working with cadavers and assisting at births, death rates plummeted.  His findings were met with great skepticism by doctors at the time, who were angry at being blamed for patients dying.
After Louis Pasteur and Joseph Lister published their findings about the need to maintain antiseptic conditions during surgery, the benefits of good hand hygiene to prevent transmission of infection slowly became universally accepted. The World Health Organization (WHO) states that even in resource-rich settings, hand washing compliance can be as low as zero percent, with compliance levels most frequently well below 40 percent.3
Healthcare-Acquired Infections Associated With Poor Hand Hygiene
Hand carriage of resistant pathogens has repeatedly been shown to be associated with healthcare-associated infections (HAI).4 Microbes that can be spread on the hands of health-care staff can include Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Strep), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Clostridium difficile, Candida, Rotavirus, Adenovirus, Hepatitis A virus, and Norovirus.
Good hand hygiene is the single most important, simplest, and least expensive means of reducing the prevalence of infections acquired in healthcare settings. Healthcare-associated infections prolong recovery time and hospital stays, result in disability, increase medical costs, and pose life-threatening risks for patients.
The CDC reports that on any given day, about one in 31 hospital patients has at least one HAI. In 2015 there were an estimated 687,000 HAIs in U.S. acute care hospitals and 72,000 patients died from infections acquired during their hospitalizations.5 Up to 56 percent of neonatal deaths among babies born in hospitals are due to infections.6
Although HAI is the most frequently reported adverse event in health care, its true global burden remains unknown because of the difficulty in gathering reliable data.7  A 2013 study estimated that the total costs for five major infections acquired in health care settings in the U.S. were $9.8 billion.
Physicians Wash Hands Less Than Other Health Care Providers
Hand washing has been recognized as so critical to infection control and good patient care that it is included in the American Medical Association’s (AMA) Code of Medical Ethics. While Section 8.7 “Routine Universal Immunization of Physicians” allows for physicians to exempt from vaccination due to medical, religious, or philosophic reasons, they are not exempt from hand washing:
“Conscientious participation in routine infection control practices, such as hand washing and respiratory precautions, is a basic expectation of the profession.”8
Despite this, studies9 10 11 12 13 have documented the reluctance of physicians, more than other health care providers, to wash their hands while caring for patients, and physician adherence to hand hygiene remains low in most hospitals.14
Why don’t physicians wash their hands?
While there are technical explanations, human factors such as social norms, perceived risk, role models, perceived knowledge, and motivation, play a role.15
One study discovered that self-protection, i.e. physicians engage in hand washing to protect themselves from acquiring infections rather than to ensure patient safety, is more important for physician compliance, and that some physicians believe there is a lack of evidence that hand washing is effective in preventing cross-infection.16
Barriers to good hand hygiene
Staff hierarchy also appears to affect hand hygiene compliance in healthcare settings, including status (physician compliance is worse than nurses), being male, lack of role models among colleagues or superiors, and forgetfulness.
Clinical factors include working in an intensive care unit, working during the week (weekend compliance was better), being involved in activities with high risk of cross contamination, understaffing/overcrowding/insufficient time, patient needs taking priority, and feeling that hand hygiene interfered with the worker-patient relationship.
Environmental and behavioral factors include the belief that wearing gowns or gloves obviates the need for hand hygiene, hand washing causing skin irritation or dryness, inconveniently placed sinks and lack of soap and paper towels, lack of knowledge of protocols, skepticism regarding the value of hand hygiene, disagreement with the recommendations, and lack of institutional priority/sanctions for non-compliers.17
According to Erin DuPree, MD, chief medical officer and vice president with the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare, the failure of many healthcare workers to practice proper hand hygiene techniques
“is a complex problem that isn’t easy to solve. A simple slogan or campaign isn’t enough, nor is demanding that healthcare workers try harder. Comprehensive, systematic and sustainable change is the only solution to the problem.”18
Good hand hygiene reduces infections and costs
A WHO report on the evidence of hand hygiene on transmission of multi-drug resistant infections in healthcare settings cites a study that showed that when hand hygiene compliance increased from poor (<60 percent) to excellent (90 percent), each level of improvement was associated with a 24 percent reduction in the risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) acquisition.19
One 2016 study at the University of North Carolina Hospitals found that during a 17-month study period following a hand hygiene program that resulted in a ten percent improvement in hand hygiene, they reported six percent fewer HAIs and 197 fewer infections, 22 fewer deaths and an overall savings of $5 million.20
In a paper published in 2015 in the Journal of Infection and Drug Resistance, author Mary-Louise McLaws notes that the relationship between hand hygiene and HAI is complicated by such things as implementation of concurrent interventions, measurement error, and surveillance bias, and is therefore “complicated”.21
New vaccines coming for healthcare associated infections
Current vaccines licensed by the FDA are available for adenovirus (given to U.S. soldiers), rotovirus and hepatitis A, infections that can be transmitted in healthcare settings. Pfizer pulled the plug on its new Staphylococcus aureus vaccine candidate after it failed a phase 2b trial in December 2018.
However, a university collaborative announced in November 2019 that they had successfully used a biofilm-specific vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus infection in mice and rabbits.22 Pfizer is advancing a vaccine against Clostridium difficile, and Vaxart, a small San Francisco vaccine biotech, has completed phase 1b studies on a norovirus vaccine and are ready to begin phase 2b.23
The Washington University School of Medicine and the biotech startup VaxNewMo has developed a glycoconjugate vaccine candidate for Klebsiella that may have potential for progression to early stage clinical trials. Several anti-candida vaccines have been tested in clinical trials, although there is still no vaccine available.24

There are 271 New Vaccines in Big Pharma’s Pipeline,"       

Roll Up Your Sleeves Folks, There are 271 New Vaccines in Big Pharma’s Pipeline
Into Whose Bodies Will They be Injected?
by Gary G. Kohls, MD
Health Impact News
“No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable…for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death.” – President Ronald Wilson Reagan, as he signed The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) of 1986, absolving drug companies from all medico-legal liability when children die, become chronically ill with vaccine-induced autoimmune disorders or are otherwise disabled from vaccine injuries. That law has led directly to an expected reckless, liability-free development of scores of new, over-priced, potential block-buster vaccines, now numbering over 250. The question that must be asked of Big Medicine’s practitioners: How will the CDC, the AMA, the AAFP and the American Academy of Pediatrics fit any more potentially neurotoxic vaccines into the current well-baby over-vaccination schedule?
PhRMA (the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America), the pharmaceutical industry’s trade association and powerful lobbying group, says that:
today, more than 7,000 medicines are in development globally, all of which have the potential to help patients in the United States and around the world. According to another data source, there are 3,400 medicines in development today just in the United States, an increase of 40 percent since 2005. (Source.)
PhRMA also says that today:
the 271 vaccines in development span a wide array of diseases, and employ exciting new scientific strategies and technologies. These potential vaccines – all in human clinical trials or under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – include 137 for infectious diseases, 99 for cancer, 15 for allergies and 10 for neurological disorders. (Source.)
Whenever the FDA signals that it is ready to grant marketing approval for a new vaccine or drug, the first step for the pharmaceutical company’s marketing department is to promote an “educational” advertising campaign designed to instill fear in parents (and their pediatricians) about the horrible illnesses (albeit previously unknown, benign or rare) that even us doctors hadn’t yet recognized as being significant up until recently. Most of us physicians have gone along with the fear-mongering that makes our practices busier while it also makes billions of dollars in profits for some unworthy CEO or Wall Street investment banker, hedge fund manager or mutual fund investor – all at the expense of America’s precious and vulnerable children who are at high risk of being sickened along the way.
The TV commercials, medical journal articles and drug representatives will be trying to educate us about a new, unaffordable vaccine that will somehow be squeezed into an already crowded and potentially deadly group of shots that America’s already at-risk-of-vaccine-injuries infants will now be receiving at their next well-child (perhaps soon to become chronically ill) check-up.
New Laws Being Passed to Mandate ALL Vaccines, Including Future Vaccines

Recognizing this, and so as not to overload the already over-loaded well-child inoculation schedule, perhaps he CDC (the Big Pharma-subsidized and vaccine cheerleader Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) will be adding shots to the in-hospital and irrational Hepatitis B shot that it recommends be given on day one – when vulnerable mothers are too exhausted and emotionally confused to give truly informed consent.
Many state legislatures are, as we speak, considering (or have already passed laws) criminalizing the previously legal parental right of refusing vaccinations on the basis of religious or philosophical beliefs. That is happening right now in Wisconsin’s Republican-dominated legislature, Minnesota’s split GOP/DFL legislature, and California’s Democratic Party-dominated legislature – where it is already signed into law by Democrat Jerry Brown.
These poorly informed – and heavily bribed politicians – don’t realize that their legislative efforts will be blindly forcing unsuspecting patients to submit to every new blockbuster vaccine that successfully emerges from the pipeline. Talk about making decisions on the basis of partial information or propaganda from sociopathic corporate entities! Attention, Senators Al Franken, Amy Klobuchar and other assorted legislators. Are you listening to the real science or to the corrupted, pseudoscience of Big Pharma?
Below is a list of 146 new vaccines that were in the pipeline as of 2010. The list, PhRMA proudly tells us, is now up to 271 new vaccines as of 2013. For a full listing of these vaccine trials, go to: http://phrma.org/sites/default/files/pdf/infectiousdiseases2010%20%281%29.pdf
For parents whose infants’ brains and bodies are immunologically and developmentally immature, be aware that your children may be forced to suffer untested-for and therefore unacknowledged long term neurological, autoimmune and chronic illness adverse effects. Parents need to be aware that if their infant dies, is sickened or is made chronically ill by vaccine ingredients, they, as protective parents, will be forbidden to sue the guilty drug company (or the doctor that administered them) for appropriate damages.
Parents and grandparents of children need to be aware of the fact that many of these new vaccines will be containing contaminants (such as unfilterable viral particles, bacterial particles, monkey kidney cell fragments, human fetal cells, squalene (in anthrax and some experimental swine flu vaccines), peanut oil (a likely cause of the epidemic of peanut allergies), formaldehyde (and even foreign DNA fragments) as well as known neurotoxic additives such as formaldehyde and aluminum (and perhaps even mercury), all of which are known genetic toxins and known causes of (sometimes subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle – but always preventable) brain damage, vaccine-induced epilepsy, autoimmune disorders, the so-called, but erroneously labeled “shaken baby syndrome” (now increasingly understood to represent a vaccine-induced encephalitis), SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome), dementia, autism spectrum disorders, mitochondrial toxicity, damage to the brain’s microglial and astroglial cells (the brain’s immune system), etc.

California Doctor Reports Hospitals in China are Open to Ozone Treatments to Fight Coronavirus,"       

Coronavirus Update – Situation Worsening – Whistle blower Chinese Doctor Dies from Virus Creating Public Protests against Government
by Dr. Robert J. Rowen
Folks, the coronavirus outbreak is worsening. Tens of millions in China are on lockdown. There are outbreaks in the USA and quarantines on military bases. The disease process seems to be getting clearer.
This disease can take the young and healthy. It spreads very rapidly and quickly. The death rate in clusters has been as high as 4% but seems to be in the 2% range. It can be transmitted long before symptoms appear.
The N.Y. Times article cites medical journals’ (considered “prestigious”) reports on this virus, and the director of the NIH. For your information, the manuscript I posted on my office website was improved, and totally referenced, and submitted to these journals for publication as commentary.
No interest. It was also forwarded to the same head of the NIH. No response.
It was sent to the Chinese embassy in DC. There, I did get a response from a health person who promised to transmit it to the mainland.
I have contacts in China. The situation is so bad that hospitals are at last open to ozone therapy and the 10-pass technique in an effort to save lives.
In this outbreak, I think DIV ozone (direct intravenous gas) will be far more cost effective as 15 people can be treated in the time of one 10 pass treatment.
However, I am told that DIV is currently sidelined while they look into my actually preferred form of ozone therapy – hyperbaric ozone.
Now, I have been concerned about viral bioweapons for some time. There are people who strongly believe this was a bioweapons experiment gone awry.
I can’t comment on that. However, I am not that afraid that an untreatable viral bioweapon can be developed. As I described earlier, coronavirus, like Ebola, must attach to, fuse to, and then enter the cell. Outside the cell, it is nothing more than a grain of sand in the wind. But in the cell, it wreaks havoc.
These viruses have an Achilles heel, which I believe I am the first and only to point out and run with. They have amino acid “fingers” which attach to the cell for fusion. Key amino acids are cysteine and tryptophan.
Cysteine is the most vulnerable amino acid to ozone/oxidant alteration, and tryptophan is second.
Hello out there, medical mob! Is anyone reading the writing on the wall? It appears we have the PERFECT antiviral in our hands RIGHT NOW. Ozone chops off the “fingers” of the viruses preventing them from “opening the cookie jar” (the cell).
And we get a bonus with this one (ozone). The lethal viruses also can incite an immune response so vigorous that the response itself kills the host. That is why young and healthy people are dying. Ozone modulates this immune response, even if administered days before exposure to a pathogen. (Found in Cuban research).
There are other oxidation therapies you can defend yourself with. MMS, or chlorine dioxide is all over the internet. I do think it is a very viable option. We often have our patients nebulize a weak hydrogen peroxide solution.
We do NOT recommend oral use. We have given peroxide intravenously with outstanding success. It reduced influenza mortality in the 1918 outbreak in India b 50%. The IV solution strength is 0.03%. (It can be quite hard on veins). We have not seen any problems from nebulizing that concentration. Food grade peroxide ranges from 3-12% from what I have seen. It MUST be diluted with saline, also available in drug stores.
Nebulizers are available everywhere. Food grade peroxide is generally available as well. I’ve seen it at Whole Foods and some local natural foods markets. Nebulizers will hold about 5 cc of solution. A mist will spew out which can be inhaled. I don’t expect this method to be as powerful as any intravenous oxidation, since the latter provides a much higher dose of oxidants. A home ozone machine can assist you to get ozone (oxidants) in water, ear, rectal, vagina, and sauna.
The Times has also reported that the WHO and CDC has offered assistance to China for weeks- and been ignored. Who are these entities to criticize? It is a classic case of the pot calling the kettle black.
I (or Dr. Robins) have reached out to the CDC, the WHO, and Times. Dr. Robins has repeatedly tried. I have also reached out to my local paper.
All, deaf ears. We are being run by a Pharma oligarchy, and if a 2-4% death rate reaches our shores, we will suffer a catastrophe, waiting for the Pharma/government complex to save us.
I prefer to take matters into my own hands. We are ordering a lot of small IV needles to treat lots of people if the epidemic comes here.
Please note that I, like the Chinese doctor, have issued an early warning on this virus. My warning is different – that we actually have a treatment for it. I don’t expect to have problems with this virus if it comes my way like the unfortunate case of the whistle blowing Chinese doctor, on how to remedy this virus. The Chinese doctor expired from the disease itself. I don’t think any of us have to. And interestingly, the Chinese doctor was taken in by authorities for his early warnings.
Fortunately Robins and I have not been taken in. We have just been ignored.
I again urge you to see my ozone review article listed below. Please feel free to pass my information on to news outlets, media, etc. I am always available to openly discuss with them.

Stop the Fear-Mongering! 12 Medical Scientists Speak Out on COVID19 Responses,"       

Comments by Brian Shilhavy
Editor, Health Impact News
Fear over the coronavirus is gripping the nation and world, as within a short period of time life around the globe has drastically changed very suddenly.
The main question facing everyone in the U.S. today is: How serious is this? Is the response the government is making right now consistent with the threat this virus presents?
Some are proposing that anyone in the media who dares to question the official narrative should be silenced for the sake of “public health.”
Facebook, for example, took strong actions against Health Impact News by claiming we were publishing “fake news,” mainly by publishing the views of Dr. Andrew W. Saul, Editor of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, who published news about successful intravenous Vitamin C therapy which had started in China. See:
More Vitamin C Studies Approved in China to Fight Coronavirus: Therapy Censored in U.S.
And yet this week, the New York Post reported that the same therapy had started at hospitals in New York City. See:
New York Hospitals Treating Coronavirus Patients with Vitamin C
With the Coronavirus situation affecting virtually every single person on the planet right now, suppressing alternative information that goes against the “mainstream” narrative is a very dangerous precedent, and is a clear violation of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment which protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press.
It is especially concerning when one of my colleagues in the alternative media, without even contacting me directly, publicly demands that we retract one of our articles authored by a medical doctor, simply because this person believes his view of the current situation is the only correct view.
I do not pretend to be an expert on medical science, which is why Health Impact News publishes alternative views by medical doctors and other scientists who are experts in their field.
During difficult days like the ones currently facing us, I believe the public has a right to read all sides of the issue and make up their own minds. Caution is certainly prudent, but fear?
Among all the Fear, Where is Faith in God?
Image to a video from a website that has claimed millions of people are going to die, that there will be massive food shortages, and that the American public will turn to cannibalism, etc.
The opposite of fear is “faith.”
Have we lost our way as a nation? Does the phrase inscribed on our currency “In God we Trust” mean anything anymore?
Faith in God does NOT mean we will not face difficult times. On the contrary, often those who are most faithful face the most difficult trials in life.
Faith in God means we trust that there is a stronger power than ourselves controlling the affairs of humanity, and that if we trust in him, he will give us the strength to endure whatever trials come our way.
Quick decisions based on fear seldom turn out well.
I will not pretend to know what is going to happen in the immediate future, and I do not claim to be a mouthpiece for God to tell you what to do.
My own personal belief system trusts God, and I also believe that in this point of history, being on this side of the death and resurrection of the Messiah Jesus Christ, whose sacrificial death on the cross paid the penalty for all of our sins, means that every single person can have a direct pipeline to God if they will just seek him.
God has a specific plan for your life, and only YOU can know that by seeking him out during these difficult days.
Don’t listen to me or anyone else who claims to know what God’s plan is for your life, because he is more than willing to lead you and guide you if you seek him out.
Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.
Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!
(Matthew 7:7-11)
I, for my part, will endeavor to give you as much information as possible, which will often contradict what the corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media reports, and may also contradict what others in the Alternative Media are writing.
For today, here are the perspectives of 12 medical scientists who are concerned about the current narrative being reported in the mainstream media.
Thanks to Off-Guardian.org for putting this together.
12 Experts Questioning the Coronavirus Panic
Dr Sucharit Bhakdi is a specialist in microbiology. He was a professor at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz and head of the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene and one of the most cited research scientists in German history.
What he says:
We are afraid that 1 million infections with the new virus will lead to 30 deaths per day over the next 100 days. But we do not realise that 20, 30, 40 or 100 patients positive for normal coronaviruses are already dying every day.
[The government’s anti-COVID19 measures] are grotesque, absurd and very dangerous […] The life expectancy of millions is being shortened. The horrifying impact on the world economy threatens the existence of countless people. The consequences on medical care are profound. Already services to patients in need are reduced, operations cancelled, practices empty, hospital personnel dwindling. All this will impact profoundly on our whole society.
All these measures are leading to self-destruction and collective suicide based on nothing but a spook.
Dr Wolfgang Wodarg is a German physician specialising in Pulmonology, politician and former chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In 2009 he called for an inquiry into alleged conflicts of interest surrounding the EU response to the Swine Flu pandemic.
What he says:
Politicians are being courted by scientists…scientists who want to be important to get money for their institutions. Scientists who just swim along in the mainstream and want their part of it […] And what is missing right now is a rational way of looking at things.
We should be asking questions like “How did you find out this virus was dangerous?”, “How was it before?”, “Didn’t we have the same thing last year?”, “Is it even something new?”
That’s missing.

Dr Joel Kettner is professor of Community Health Sciences and Surgery at Manitoba University, former Chief Public Health Officer for Manitoba province and Medical Director of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases.
What he says:
I have never seen anything like this, anything anywhere near like this. I’m not talking about the pandemic, because I’ve seen 30 of them, one every year. It is called influenza. And other respiratory illness viruses, we don’t always know what they are. But I’ve never seen this reaction, and I’m trying to understand why.
[…]
I worry about the message to the public, about the fear of coming into contact with people, being in the same space as people, shaking their hands, having meetings with people. I worry about many, many consequences related to that.
[…]
In Hubei, in the province of Hubei, where there has been the most cases and deaths by far, the actual number of cases reported is 1 per 1000 people and the actual rate of deaths reported is 1 per 20,000. So maybe that would help to put things into perspective.
Dr John Ioannidis Professor of Medicine, of Health Research and Policy and of Biomedical Data Science, at Stanford University School of Medicine and a Professor of Statistics at Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences. He is director of the Stanford Prevention Research Center, and co-director of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS).
He is also the editor-in-chief of the European Journal of Clinical Investigation. He was chairman at the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, University of Ioannina School of Medicine as well as adjunct professor at Tufts University School of Medicine.
As a physician, scientist and author he has made contributions to evidence-based medicine, epidemiology, data science and clinical research. In addition, he pioneered the field of meta-research. He has shown that much of the published research does not meet good scientific standards of evidence.
What he says:
Patients who have been tested for SARS-CoV-2 are disproportionately those with severe symptoms and bad outcomes. As most health systems have limited testing capacity, selection bias may even worsen in the near future.
The one situation where an entire, closed population was tested was the Diamond Princess cruise ship and its quarantine passengers. The case fatality rate there was 1.0%, but this was a largely elderly population, in which the death rate from Covid-19 is much higher.
[…]
Could the Covid-19 case fatality rate be that low? No, some say, pointing to the high rate in elderly people. However, even some so-called mild or common-cold-type coronaviruses that have been known for decades can have case fatality rates as high as 8% when they infect elderly people in nursing homes.
[…]
If we had not known about a new virus out there, and had not checked individuals with PCR tests, the number of total deaths due to “influenza-like illness” would not seem unusual this year. At most, we might have casually noted that flu this season seems to be a bit worse than average.
 – “A fiasco in the making? As the coronavirus pandemic takes hold, we are making decisions without reliable data”, Stat News, 17th March 2020
Dr Yoram Lass is an Israeli physician, politician and former Director General of the Health Ministry. He also worked as Associate Dean of the Tel Aviv University Medical School and during the 1980s presented the science-based television show Tatzpit.
What he says:
Italy is known for its enormous morbidity in respiratory problems, more than three times any other European country. In the US about 40,000 people die in a regular flu season and so far 40-50 people have died of the coronavirus, most of them in a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington.
[…]
In every country, more people die from regular flu compared with those who die from the coronavirus.
[…]
…there is a very good example that we all forget: the swine flu in 2009. That was a virus that reached the world from Mexico and until today there is no vaccination against it. But what? At that time there was no Facebook or there maybe was but it was still in its infancy. The coronavirus, in contrast, is a virus with public relations.
Whoever thinks that governments end viruses is wrong.
 – Interview in Globes, March 22nd 2020
Dr Pietro Vernazza is a Swiss physician specialising Infectious Diseases at the Cantonal Hospital St. Gallen and Professor of Health Policy.
What he says:
We have reliable figures from Italy and a work by epidemiologists, which has been published in the renowned science journal ‹Science›, which examined the spread in China. This makes it clear that around 85 percent of all infections have occurred without anyone noticing the infection. 90 percent of the deceased patients are verifiably over 70 years old, 50 percent over 80 years.
[…]
In Italy, one in ten people diagnosed die, according to the findings of the Science publication, that is statistically one of every 1,000 people infected. Each individual case is tragic, but often – similar to the flu season – it affects people who are at the end of their lives.
[…]
If we close the schools, we will prevent the children from quickly becoming immune.
[…]
We should better integrate the scientific facts into the political decisions.
 – Interview in St. Galler Tagblatt, 22nd March 2020
Frank Ulrich Montgomery is German radiologist, former President of the German Medical Association and Deputy Chairman of the World Medical Association.
What he says:
I’m not a fan of lockdown. Anyone who imposes something like this must also say when and how to pick it up again. Since we have to assume that the virus will be with us for a long time, I wonder when we will return to normal? You can’t keep schools and daycare centers closed until the end of the year. Because it will take at least that long until we have a vaccine. Italy has imposed a lockdown and has the opposite effect. They quickly reached their capacity limits, but did not slow down the virus spread within the lockdown.
 – Interview in General Anzeiger, 18th March 2020
Prof. Hendrik Streeck is a German HIV researcher, epidemiologist and clinical trialist. He is professor of virology, and the director of the Institute of Virology and HIV Research, at Bonn University.
What he says:
The new pathogen is not that dangerous, it is even less dangerous than Sars-1. The special thing is that Sars-CoV-2 replicates in the upper throat area and is therefore much more infectious because the virus jumps from throat to throat, so to speak. But that is also an advantage: Because Sars-1 replicates in the deep lungs, it is not so infectious, but it definitely gets on the lungs, which makes it more dangerous.
[…]
You also have to take into account that the Sars-CoV-2 deaths in Germany were exclusively old people. In Heinsberg, for example, a 78-year-old man with previous illnesses died of heart failure, and that without Sars-2 lung involvement. Since he was infected, he naturally appears in the Covid 19 statistics. But the question is whether he would not have died anyway, even without Sars-2.
 – Interview in Frankfurter Allgemeine, 16th March 2020
Dr Yanis Roussel et. al. – A team of researchers from the Institut Hospitalo-universitaire Méditerranée Infection, Marseille and the Institut de Recherche pour le Développement, Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Marseille, conducting a peer-reviewed study on Coronavirus mortality for the government of France under the ‘Investments for the Future’ programme.
What they say:
The problem of SARS-CoV-2 is probably overestimated, as 2.6 million people die of respiratory infections each year compared with less than 4000 deaths for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of writing.
[…]
This study compared the mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 in OECD countries (1.3%) with the mortality rate of common coronaviruses identified in AP-HM patients (0.8%) from 1 January 2013 to 2 March 2020. Chi-squared test was performed, and the P-value was 0.11 (not significant).
[…]
…it should be noted that systematic studies of other coronaviruses (but not yet for SARS-CoV-2) have found that the percentage of asymptomatic carriers is equal to or even higher than the percentage of symptomatic patients. The same data for SARS-CoV-2 may soon be available, which will further reduce the relative risk associated with this specific pathology.
 – “SARS-CoV-2: fear versus data”, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, 19th March 2020
Dr. David Katz is an American physician and founding director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center
What he says:
I am deeply concerned that the social, economic and public health consequences of this near-total meltdown of normal life — schools and businesses closed, gatherings banned — will be long-lasting and calamitous, possibly graver than the direct toll of the virus itself. The stock market will bounce back in time, but many businesses never will. The unemployment, impoverishment and despair likely to result will be public health scourges of the first order.
 – “Is Our Fight Against Coronavirus Worse Than the Disease?”, New York Times 20th March 2020
Michael T. Osterholm is regents professor and director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
What he says:
Consider the effect of shutting down offices, schools, transportation systems, restaurants, hotels, stores, theaters, concert halls, sporting events and other venues indefinitely and leaving all of their workers unemployed and on the public dole. The likely result would be not just a depression but a complete economic breakdown, with countless permanently lost jobs, long before a vaccine is ready or natural immunity takes hold.
[…]
[T]he best alternative will probably entail letting those at low risk for serious disease continue to work, keep business and manufacturing operating, and “run” society, while at the same time advising higher-risk individuals to protect themselves through physical distancing and ramping up our health-care capacity as aggressively as possible. With this battle plan, we could gradually build up immunity without destroying the financial structure on which our lives are based.
 – “Facing covid-19 reality: A national lockdown is no cure”, Washington Post 21st March 2020
Dr Peter Goetzsche is Professor of Clinical Research Design and Analysis at the University of Copenhagen and founder of the Cochrane Medical Collaboration. He has written several books on corruption in the field of medicine and the power of big pharmaceutical companies.
What he says:
Our main problem is that no one will ever get in trouble for measures that are too draconian. They will only get in trouble if they do too little. So, our politicians and those working with public health do much more than they should do.
No such draconian measures were applied during the 2009 influenza pandemic, and they obviously cannot be applied every winter, which is all year round, as it is always winter somewhere. We cannot close down the whole world permanently.
Should it turn out that the epidemic wanes before long, there will be a queue of people wanting to take credit for this. And we can be damned sure draconian measures will be applied again next time. But remember the joke about tigers. “Why do you blow the horn?” “To keep the tigers away.” “But there are no tigers here.” “There you see!”

Children Being Medically Kidnapped from Parents Due to Coronavirus Scare,"       
Katie Spencer reports that a judge removed her two daughters from her custody because she worked in a clinic where she might have exposure to the Coronavirus. Photo from Facebook.

Health Impact News
With the amount of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. rising every day, the majority of states have issued mandatory social isolation, but does this include isolation from your own children?  
Two mothers have recently spoken out about how the Coronavirus pandemic has been used to take away their children against their will, and some judges are ordering the removal of children due to potential exposure to the Coronavirus with their parents.
Healthcare workers at risk of losing their children due to possible COVID-19 exposure
A mother in Oklahoma shared a post on Facebook on March 21, stating,
“The police showed up on my doorstep at 10 PM and took my kids from me because I WORK IN A CLINIC.”
According to the mother, and court documents shared on the social media site, a judge signed off on an ex parte hearing, approving the Emergency Motion to Modify Custody and for Pick-Up Order Due to Respondent Exposure to Coronavirus.

The mother sent this warning to first responders, 
“Just a heads up to nurses, doctors, firefighters, police officers, and other first responders who have children and sneaky exes… watch your backs!”
She then also posted a copy of a gag order issued by the judge on her Facebook Page stating: “Not in violation by posting; asked and verified.”

Some Judges Cancelling Visitation Rights of Foster Children with Their Parents “just when they need the comfort of their own families the most”
On Wednesday, March 18, the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform (NCCPR) provided news and commentary on their blog concerning child abuse, child welfare, foster care, and family preservation.
The NCCPR news and commentary round-up for the week ending March 17 provided the following: 
“The Chronicle of Social Change is tracking the issues child welfare agencies will have to deal with during the COVID19 pandemic. And family defender Amy Mulzer has a tweet thread predicting how those agencies will deal with it: Badly.”
UPDATE: And, as if to prove Mulzer right, a judge in Arkansas is cutting off in-person visits between foster children and their parents – just when they need the comfort of their own families the most.
NCCPR provided a copy of an order from the circuit court of Lonoke County, Arkansas Juvenile Division.

How one mother and daughter have been affected by “social distancing”
March 21st, Leila Fadel, with NPR, provided a story that describes how social isolation is affecting the ability of parents to see their children, and also prolonging the process of trying to get their children out of foster care.
Fadel reports on Jessica, a mother from Brooklyn, New York, whose twice weekly, overnight visitation with her daughter has been suspended due to the Coronavirus pandemic.
Jessica, who asked NPR to only use her first name due to pending legal cases involving the custody of her daughter, explains how she is only allowed to communicate with her daughter through FaceTime, video conference and three-way calls.
“I can’t see her anymore, for now,” Jessica is quoted as saying.
Before the Coronavirus outbreak, Jessica told NPR how her visits went with her daughter. 
“I’m usually feeding her, singing to her, playing with her, we were bonding. It’s like [the virus] snatched it away from me now.”
To avoid the spread of the virus, child welfare services, foster agencies and family courts around the country are being forced to determine what requires in-person contact.
NPR reports, due to the coronavirus outbreak,
“New York City’s courts are only hearing cases that are deemed an emergency or essential. That means Jessica’s upcoming court appearance — when custody and visitation were supposed to be addressed — is now postponed for months. Services provided to families are also slowing down.”
Anya Mukarji-Connolly, supervising attorney at Brooklyn Defender Services, the organization representing Jessica in her case, told reporter Fadel,
“One of our biggest concerns is the slowdown in family court. We don’t know yet how this is going to impact our clients, but we know that it’s going to be terrible.” 
Other states have also temporarily suspended all in-person parental visits.  
Maine’s Office of Child and Family Services wrote in a letter on their website, addressed to both foster and adoptive parents, 
“To ensure that OCFS is remaining connected to youth, parents, and resource parents, it is expected that staff will coordinate contact to occur through phone calls or video conferencing for any families that need to be seen by the end of April 2020.”
In California, Los Angeles County courts are suspended through April 16th for all “non-emergency and non-essential matters.”
According to NPR, 
“Los Angeles County has the largest child welfare system in the country and right now it says it is fully staffed and continuing in-home visits, placements and removals, while also assessing what in-person contact is absolutely necessary. It’s also providing protective gear to its staff.”
Bobby Cagle, the director of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services is quoted by Fadel as saying,
“Much of the work that we do is emergency basis, and that means that we have to appear at the home unannounced.
When we do that, we try to equip those workers first with the kind of masks, eye protection, gloves and gowns that they need in the event that they encounter a family member who is, or could be, sick.”
The story reports,
Cagle is managing a system of some 9,000 staff who serve about 34,000 children at any given time.
“The work of child protection is a 24-hour a day, seven days a week endeavor across our country,” Cagle says.
“And just like police protection and fire protection, our services continue throughout the crisis and the social distancing.”
Fadel points out, 
“The same isolation that is supposed to keep people healthy could also be detrimental for a child who is being mistreated.”
Cagle tells Fadel that calls to the child protection hotline are down due to schools being closed, and teachers and school staff, who normally have an eye out for alleged abuse, aren’t seeing kids. This has led Cagle to call on the public to watch for signs of abuse and neglect and to call the Child Protection Hotline. 
Cagle told NPR,
“I very strongly encourage the public to remain vigilant about the safety of children in families,” he says.
“This is a time of increased stress and we know from the work that we do that this can also cause an uptick in maltreatment of children. And so we want to be very much on the watch for that.”
For now, Jessica will have to continue any contact with her daughter via FaceTime and phone calls. Her upcoming court appearances have now been postponed for months, based on the report by NPR.
The services provided to families have also slowed down. Jessica’s supervising attorney, Mukarji-Connolly, says,
“Not having access to services, not having access to visitation, it’s certainly going to be harmful to the families, but also we anticipate it will delay reunification.”

Dr. Fauci’s History in Spending Billions of Government Funds on Vaccine Research with Little to Show for it,"       

Dr. Fauci and COVID-19 Priorities: Therapeutics Now or Vaccines Later?
by Lyn Redwood, RN, MSN, President; Mary Holland, Children’s Health Defense General Counsel & Vice Chair; and the Children’s Health Defense Team
The rapidity with which normal life has ground to a halt as a result of coronavirus-related edicts has stunned citizens around the world, generating massive social and economic upheaval.
Meanwhile, media coverage of COVID-19 has whipped up unprecedented levels of public anxiety and fear, laying the psychological groundwork for people to eagerly embrace “magic bullet” medical solutions, no matter how experimental.
In the U.S., the World Health Organization (WHO) is now compounding the domestic panic, warning that America could become the new coronavirus “epicenter.”
Across the country, a debate is raging about the nation’s medical response and how best to apportion available resources. Many argue, quite reasonably, for the importance of identifying safe, effective and affordable therapies that can provide immediate help to those who are sick.
On March 22, The New York Times reported that there are at least 69 existing drugs or compounds that might be effective in treating the coronavirus.
In China, researchers are studying intravenous vitamin C as a potential nontoxic treatment, while a paper published by French researchers on March 20 described promising COVID-19 results from the off-label use of hydroxychloroquine (an antimalarial) and azithromycin (an antibiotic).
The head of the French team, Didier Raoult, MD, PhD, is one of the world’s top infectious disease and virology experts, with roughly 2,000 peer-reviewed publications and multiple awards to his name.
Raoult and coauthors point out that a major advantage of “repositioning” older drugs for this coronavirus is that their safety profile, side effects, dosing and drug interactions are already well documented.
However, Ian Lipkin, MD, of Columbia University recently told MSNBC, with a grin, that investments tend to go toward treatments that are “sexy and new and patentable” rather than to “tried-and-true, classical sort of methods repurposing drugs and strategies that have already been shown to work.”
Fauci’s tired rhetoric
For biopharma companies that are poised to profit from COVID-19-related misfortune, older drugs that have outlived their patent terms are not terribly helpful for the bottom line.
Could this be why leading White House coronavirus advisor Anthony Fauci, MD, long-time head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), recently pooh-poohed the published chloroquine evidence as merely “anecdotal”?
Fauci is a stalwart enthusiast of “patentable” vaccines, skilled in attracting massive government funding for vaccines that either never materialize or are spectacularly ineffective or unsafe.
For example, Fauci once shilled for the fast-tracked H1N1 influenza (“swine flu”) vaccine on YouTube, reassuring viewers in 2009 that serious adverse events were “very, very, very rare.”
Shortly thereafter, the vaccine went on to wreak havoc in multiple countries, increasing miscarriage risks in pregnant women in the U.S., provoking a spike in adolescent narcolepsy in Scandinavia and causing febrile convulsions in one in every 110 vaccinated children in Australia—prompting the latter to suspend its influenza vaccination program in under-fives.
In 2010, then-Senator and physician Tom Coburn, MD, called out Fauci for misleadingly touting “significant progress in HIV vaccine research.” Coburn stated ,
“The study [Fauci] referred to was a clinical trial in Thailand finding a vaccine to be 31% effective at preventing HIV infection. Unfortunately, the results of this study have been found to be statistically insignificant and the findings of the study have received much skepticism.
[. . .]
Most scientists involved in AIDS research believe that an HIV vaccine is further away than ever . . . and may never be possible. . . .”
Senator Coburn also noted that Fauci’s agency had spent over $5.2 million over a four-year period on lavish “HIV vaccine awareness” events.
Without the least hint of embarrassment, however, Fauci reappeared on YouTube in 2016 to once again push his HIV vaccine agenda, even citing the unimpressive Thailand trial.
Fauci’s mobilization of billions for a never-completed Zika vaccine followed a similar playbook. And now, Fauci is predictably shining a spotlight on risky and uncertain coronavirus vaccines that may not be available for two years, rather than prioritizing the short-term therapies that patients need right now.
First off the block
According to the WHO, up to 35 COVID-19 vaccines are in the offing, including experimental messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines and formulations that attach coronavirus to genetically modified measles vaccines.
As biopharma companies position themselves to reap blockbuster profits, the first off the block is a vaccine thrown together at record speed by Fauci’s NIAID in collaboration with Massachusetts-based biotech firm Moderna.
NIAID and Moderna began developing the vaccine before a single COVID-19 case had appeared in the U.S., completing the first batch of vaccine “within 42 days of the company obtaining genetic information on the coronavirus.”
The vaccine, which bears the ho-hum name of mRNA-1273, uses an unproven mRNA technology platform. mRNA vaccines appeal to industry because of the potential for “rapid, inexpensive and scalable manufacturing,” but researchers at Harvard and other medical sciences institutions have issued warnings about the vaccines’ propensity to produce higher rates of side effects, including local and systemic inflammation and worrisome autoimmune responses.
Noting that the “non-native modified nucleotides” used in mRNA vaccines and components of mRNA vaccines’ delivery systems have potentially toxic effects, these researchers recommend taking precautions during preclinical studies and clinical trials.
Fauci, on the other hand, praises the “new era of vaccinology”—of which the mRNA-1273 effort is a part—celebrating its use of “atomic level structural information for vaccine design, gene-based vaccine platforms, modern protein engineering and potent adjuvants.”
On March 16, NIAID launched a Phase 1 trial of mRNA-1273 in 45 healthy adults after making the decision—deemed “morally questionable” by some—to sidestep the standard process for vaccine development.
That process ordinarily requires “that a manufacturer show a product is safe [in animal models] before it goes into people.” Leading virologist Shibo Jiang, MD, PhD, recently condemned this “quick-fix” approach, arguing that “safety always comes first” and that it is important not to “cut corners” by skipping animal studies. Moderna’s chief medical officer disagrees, saying,
“I don’t think proving this in an animal model is on the critical path to getting this to a clinical trial.”
For his part, Fauci has expressed willingness to expedite the vaccine’s approval process as soon as NIAID deems the Phase 1 trial successful.
Vaccine-hesitant experts
Ordinarily, vaccine scientists line up in lockstep to pledge their allegiance to the Faucian worldview that vaccination is the “mainstay” of prevention and offers the primary solution for challenges such as the coronavirus situation.
In an interesting turn of events, however, some of the pharma-funded media’s favorite vaccine spokesmen—slick, high-level medical professionals that manufacturers ordinarily can count on to endorse any vaccine—are urging caution.
Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, is no stranger to coronaviruses, having developed a vaccine for an earlier coronavirus in 2016 that stopped just short of commercial development.
Despite having “tried like heck” to obtain funding to move his vaccine into clinical trials, Hotez just told a U.S. Congressional Committee (on March 5 ) that coronavirus vaccines are scientifically challenging and have a “unique potential safety problem,” namely a “kind of paradoxical immune enhancement phenomenon.”
When Hotez observed this immune pathology in his coronavirus laboratory animals, he thought,
“Oh my God, this is going to be problematic.”
Paul Offit, MD, of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, another media darling who has profited handsomely from his insider status, stated in a March 10 YouTube interview that influenza deaths are “far worse” than COVID-19 deaths, “yet we don’t quarantine for influenza, we don’t shut down schools for influenza, we don’t cancel meetings for influenza, we don’t cancel schools and churches and synagogues.”
Also Offit expressed worry about the push to “rush [a vaccine] through,” particularly in the absence of “any history of making a coronavirus vaccine.” Offit concluded:
And certainly the FDA has got to regulate this product because right now everybody in the United States will probably take it in a second, even if it wasn’t tested.
A profitable crisis
In early March, Congress passed an emergency coronavirus spending bill, much of which will “directly benefit the drug industry.” Legislators who tried—and failed—to include meaningful affordability provisions in the spending bill worry that
“A danger remains that the federal government will simply write a blank check signed to big pharma as a result of this crisis.”
Clues that pharma is embracing the opportunities furnished by the COVID-19 crisis come from the financial markets. Market reports indicate that the health care industry has been able to “withstand” the wider stock market plunge due to big gains by pharmaceutical, biotech and medical diagnostic companies involved in developing coronavirus-related products.
After Moderna announced, in late February, that it had shipped off its mRNA-1273 to NIAID for the Phase 1 trial, the company instantly became “one of the hottest biotech stocks on the market.” (Moderna’s NASDAQ ticker symbol is, handily enough, MRNA.)
Investment advisors have pointed out that the likely promotion of mRNA-1273 as prevention is a “big deal” that stands to make Moderna a fortune, because “millions” of uninfected people will want to “pre-emptively protect themselves.”
Coronavirus drug and vaccine manufacturers are also sitting pretty because of liability immunity conferred under the 2005 PREP Act (Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act) and a follow-up Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Declaration specific to COVID-19 published in the Federal Register on February 4, 2020.
The PREP Act protects the manufacturers of medical “countermeasures”—including vaccines, medications, medical devices and other products—from the risk of damages in the event of a declared public health emergency such as the currently declared coronavirus pandemic.
The tort immunity described under the COVID-19 Declaration pertains to
“any claim of loss caused by, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the manufacture, distribution, administration, or use of medical countermeasures . . . except for claims involving ‘willful misconduct’ as defined in the PREP Act.”
The authors of a legal blog point out that while the new HHS declaration “is couched in a lot of administrative word salad,” the “prime takeaway is that the scope of tort immunity being conferred . . . is quite broad.”
In fact, the PREP Act became law over significant consumer and congressional opposition. Senator Ted Kennedy and 20 colleagues in Congress wrote a letter to the Speaker of the House and Majority Leader to repeal the Act, characterizing it as “a travesty of the legislative process” and stating that it could “be used to allow manufacturers of virtually any drug or vaccine to escape responsibility for gross negligence or even criminal acts.”
The dissenting lawmakers also accused the Act’s sponsors of creating “an empty shell of a compensation program for injured patients with none of the funding needed to make compensation a reality.”
Safety first
A look at the response to past influenza and coronavirus epidemics provides little reassurance that safety considerations will come first. In addition to the already mentioned adverse events associated with the 2009 swine flu vaccine, we have witnessed treatments that “may have been harmful” and whistleblower lawsuits against false claims of efficacy.
For the moment, our government is prioritizing vaccine development (with the enticing promise of lucrative patents) over existing therapeutics (such as vitamin C and already-FDA-approved drugs) that do not offer comparable financial windfalls.
In light of the immunity from liability guaranteed by the PREP Act during declared emergencies, fast-tracked vaccines are a sweetheart deal for both biopharma and government.
A safer and common-sense approach would direct resources toward examining the merits of existing therapeutics that can be put to immediate use.
The government must not allow Big Pharma and biotech companies to cash in on this catastrophe with speculative, patentable vaccines at the expense of the therapeutics needed to save lives now.

The Vaccine Reaction
After officials at the World Health Organization (WHO) declared on Mar. 11, 2020 that outbreaks of a mutated coronavirus (COVID-19)1 2 had become a global pandemic and urged countries to take strong action to stop its spread,3 4 the governments of countries representing one-third of the world’s population5 closed borders, restricted or halted travel between and within countries and ordered healthy people to essentially eliminate physical contact with each other by staying in their homes.
The halt to travel and closure of schools, businesses, stores and shopping centers, restaurants, theaters, sports arenas, gyms, beaches, parks and recreation areas, churches, and other places, where children are educated and people conduct business, shop and engage in recreation, sent stock markets into a sudden nosedive6 and has crippled the world’s economy.7
Testing Not Widespread Yet to Detect Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Cases
The outbreak of a new mutated coronavirus in China was publicly announced on Dec. 31, 2019,8 and by Mar. 27, 2020, over 565,000 people in 199 countries reportedly had been infected with over 25,000 confirmed deaths.9
The true number of cases that have already occurred are thought to be vastly underestimated because an unknown number of people are being asymptomatically infected or showing only mild symptoms,10 11 12 which can be mistaken for a cold or a respiratory influenza-like-illness,13 and testing for COVID-19 active infection or antibodies demonstrating past infection and natural immunity has not yet become widespread in most countries.14 15
In the U.S., since Jan. 21, 2020 more than 90,000 cases and 1,300 deaths had been confirmed spanning all 50 states.16
By Mar. 27, New York had reported the highest numbers of cases (38,987) and deaths (432) to date, with New Jersey, California, Washington, Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Massachusetts and Louisiana reporting between 2,000 and 7,000 cases each and a total of 539 deaths.17
Current Mortality Estimates Vary Among Countries
According to Worldometer,18 which is owned by Dadax and composed of an international team of developers, researchers and volunteers with no political, government or corporate affiliation analyzing and making world statistics available to the public, there is a large variation in mortality estimates associated with COVID-19 at the present time.
For example, as of Mar. 27, China appears to have 2 deaths per million people, while Germany and the U.S. currently are experiencing 4 deaths per million, but Italy has 151 deaths per million and Spain has 106 deaths per million.
For all currently reported global cases and deaths, it appears there is an average of 3.4 deaths per million people.19 However, with more widespread testing for and reporting of active and past infections, along with deaths, these preliminary COVID-19 mortality statistics for different countries could change.20
COVID-19 Complications Higher in Seniors and Chronically Ill
By mid-February, there was information coming out of China that some people were at higher risk for complications from COVID-19 infections than others, even though the majority of people have mild symptoms and recover without treatment.21
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that:22
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
Evidence published in the medical literature by early March 2020 characterizing the type of COVID-19 disease symptoms and high risk factors among the population in China revealed that common major symptoms (22-88 percent) included fever, cough, myalgia or fatigue, expectoration and difficulty breathing.
Minor symptoms (less than 12 percent) included headache or dizziness, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, with those aged 60 years or older at higher risk.23
Another study published by Chinese scientists found that underlying cardiovascular disease, secondary infections, older age and elevated inflammatory indicators in the blood suggested that COVID-19 mortality might be due to “virus-activated ‘cytokine storm syndrome” or fulminant myocarditis.”24
As of Mar. 27, 2020, the CDC currently lists the following high risk factors for severe illness from a COVID-19 infection:25
People aged 65 years and older
People who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility
Other high-risk conditions could include:

People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
People who have heart disease with complications
People who are immunocompromised including cancer treatment
People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [(BM]I)≥40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, such as those with diabetes, renal failure, or liver disease might also be at risk


People with chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma
People who have heart disease with complications
People who are immunocompromised including cancer treatment
People of any age with severe obesity (body mass index [(BM]I)≥40) or certain underlying medical conditions, particularly if not well controlled, such as those with diabetes, renal failure, or liver disease might also be at risk
People who are pregnant should be monitored since they are known to be at risk with severe viral illness, however, to date data on COVID-19 has not shown increased risk
The CDC also says that the following symptoms are found in patients who have been tested and confirmed to be infected with COVID-19:26
Frequently reported signs and symptoms of patients admitted to the hospital include fever (77–98%), cough (46%–82%), myalgia or fatigue (11–52%), and shortness of breath (3-31%) at illness onset. Among 1,099 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, fever was present in 44% at hospital admission, and developed in 89% during hospitalization. Other less commonly reported respiratory symptoms include sore throat, headache, cough with sputum production and/or hemoptysis [coughing up blood or bloody mucus]. Some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and nausea prior to developing fever and lower respiratory tract signs and symptoms.
According to the CDC,
“Based on available evidence, children do not appear to be at higher risk for COVID-19 than adults. While some children and infants have been sick with COVID-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date.”27
Americans Start Buying Masks and Hand Sanitizer to Protect Themselves
By the end of February, the World Health Organization (WHO) had not yet declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic,28 but there had been daily reports in the media warning that COVID-19 was taking a foothold in the U.S.29 and many concerned Americans had begun to make preparations to protect themselves by buying masks, hand sanitizer and stocking food and household supplies.
On Mar. 1, the U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams sent out a message on Twitter:30
Seriously people – STOP BUYING MASKS. They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching coronavirus but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk! The best way to protect yourself and your community is with everyday preventive actions, like staying home when you are sick and washing hands with soap and water, to help slow the spread of respiratory illness. Get your flu shot – fewer flu patients = more resources for COVID-19.
CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield agreed. He told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that,
“There is no role for these masks in the community. These masks need to be prioritized for health care professionals that as part of their job are taking care of individuals.”31
CDC Predicted Up To 1.7 Million COVID-19 Deaths in the U.S.
Two days after the WHO declared a COVID-19 pandemic, The New York Times published a widely-quoted article on Mar. 13 entitled “The worst-case estimate for U.S. coronavirus deaths” that raised even more concern in the public about the potential lethality of COVID-19.32
In the article, it was revealed that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had been conferring with epidemiologists at universities around the world and were modeling pandemic COVID-19 scenarios based on what was known about the transmissibility and severity of the new mutated coronavirus to come up with “worst case” estimates if no actions were taken to slow transmission.
According to The New York Times:
Between 160 million and 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to one projection. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die. The calculations based on the CDC’s scenarios suggested 2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds. Fewer than a tenth of those are for people who are critically ill.
An epidemic modeler at Johns Hopkins, Lauren Gardner, was quoted as saying, “There is a lot of room for improvement if we act appropriately,” and urged people to “change their behavior” to alter the course of the pandemic said “changing behavior” would alter the course of the pandemic.
A University of Nebraska infectious disease specialist, Dr. James Lawler, was quoted as estimating there would be 96 million Americans infected and 450,000 deaths.
The New York Times article also pointed out that, “about 20,000 to 50,000 people have died from flu-related illnesses this season, according to the CDC.”
WHO Urges Testing But U.S. Couldn’t Do It For Months – Fauci Tells Americans to “Hunker Down”
Several days later on Mar. 16, WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus criticized nations for not doing enough to test for and contain spread of COVID-19. He said:33
We have not seen an urgent enough escalation in testing, isolation and contact tracing, which is the backbone of the response… We have a simple message for all countries: Test, test, test. Test every suspected case. If they test positive, isolate them and find out who they have been in contact with two days before they developed symptoms and test those people, too.
A week later Dr. Ghebreyesus said,
“Asking people to stay at home and other physical distancing measures are an important way to slow down the spread of the virus and buy time, but they are defensive measures that won’t help us to win.”34
He once again emphasized widespread testing for COVID-19.
“All countries should be able to test all suspected cases. They cannot fight this pandemic blindfolded; they should know where the cases are.”
However, by the time COVID-19 was first reported in the U.S. on Jan. 21, 2020 until just recently, little testing for presence of the virus in the U.S. population was done.35
Instead, former and current federal health officials have put primary emphasis on shutting down education, commerce, business and recreation to try to stop spread of the virus.
Former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb told CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Mar. 8 that, “No city wants to be the first to basically shut down their economy, state and cities are going to have to act in the interest of the national interest,”36 and urged the federal government to provide economic incentives to cities and states that will suffer hardship from shutting down their economies.
On Mar. 12 at a congressional hearing, Director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Dr. Anthony Fauci admitted that the U.S. was unable to meet the required capacity for coronavirus testing of everyone in the U.S. who needs it.
“The system is not really geared to what we need right now,” he said. “That is a failing. Let’s admit it.”37
A few days later, Dr. Fauci advocated for taking aggressive quarantine and “social distancing” measures in the U.S. similar to those first taken by the Chinese and, later, the Italian government to “lockdown” populations in an effort to stop spread of COVID-19. On Mar. 15, Dr. Fauci said on NBC’s “Meet the Press:38
I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing… I think we should really be overly aggressive and get criticized for overreacting.
Persistent COVID-19 Testing Problems in the U.S.
On Mar. 22, 2020, the FDA approved a 45-minute lab test to confirm COVID-19 infections.39
The approval came after a series of investigative reports had been published by Science Magazine, Pro-Publica, and Axios that the U.S. had been suffering from continuing problems with providing COVID-19 testing kits to hospitals in the states after the COVID-19 outbreak was identified in the U.S. in January 2020.
On Feb. 28, Science Magazine reported the CDC had only performed 459 tests for the virus in patients suspected to be infected:40
The World Health Organization (WHO) has shipped testing kits to 57 countries. China had five commercial tests on the market 1 month ago and can now do up to 1.6 million tests a week; South Korea has tested 65,000 people so far.
The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in contrast, has done only 459 tests since the epidemic began. The rollout of a CDC-designed test kit to state and local labs has become a fiasco because it contained a faulty reagent.
Labs around the country eager to test more suspected cases—and test them faster—have been unable to do so. No commercial or state labs have the approval to use their own tests.
In what is already an infamous snafu, CDC initially refused a request to test a patient in Northern California who turned out to be the first probable COVID-19 case without known links to an infected person. The problems have led many to doubt that the official tally of 60 confirmed cases in the United States is accurate.
Also on Feb. 28 Pro-Publica reported:41
As the highly infectious coronavirus jumped from China to country after country in January and February, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lost valuable weeks that could have been used to track its possible spread in the United States because it insisted upon devising its own test.
The federal agency shunned the World Health Organization test guidelines used by other countries and set out to create a more complicated test of its own that could identify a range of similar viruses. But when it was sent to labs across the country in the first week of February, it didn’t work as expected.
On Mar. 1, Axios said that the Trump administration had ordered an independent investigation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab in Atlanta responsible for manufacturing COVID-19 test kits for labs around the country after reports of potential contamination of the test kits. Axios stated that,
“The U.S. government had admitted to problems with its diagnostic tests—which have put the U.S. well behind China and South Korea in doing large-scale testing of the American public for the coronavirus.”42
According to the Mar. 27 report by USA Today:43
From its biggest cities to its smallest towns, America’s chance to contain the coronavirus crisis came and went in the seven weeks since U.S. health officials botched the testing rollout and then misled scientists in state laboratories about this critical early failure.
Federal regulators failed to recognize the spiraling disaster and were slow to relax the rules that prevented labs and major hospitals from advancing a backup…the nation’s public health pillars—the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration—shirked their responsibility to protect Americans in an emergency like this new coronavirus, USA TODAY found in interviews with dozens of scientists, public health experts and community leaders, as well as email communications between laboratories and hospitals across the country.
The result was a cascading series of failures now costing lives.
Federal Agencies Fail to Stockpile Adequate Pandemic Supplies
Federal agencies responsible for pandemic planning, notably the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS)44 45 46 and Department of Homeland Security (DHS),47 which are given billions of dollars in congressional appropriations every year,48 49 appear to have been unprepared to respond quickly to the COVID-19 pandemic not only by failing to supply testing kits but because they had not stockpiled enough masks, gowns and gloves needed for health care workers and ventilators needed for patients.50
Healthcare workers at hospitals are reporting they do not feel safe treating patients with COVID-19 when they do not have appropriate protective equipment that protects both them and their patients.
In a Mar. 26 International Business Times article, a nurse working for Kaiser Permanente was quoted as saying,
“They’re putting us in danger. They’re putting our families in danger, and they’re putting our co-workers in danger.”51
In a report by NBC surveying more than 250 health care workers in the U.S., the network reported that:52
A hospital nurse in Michigan says she and her colleagues have discussed bringing in bleach to make their own disinfectant wipes.
A pregnant nurse in Ohio says she has no choice but to tend to critically ill patients without a specialized N95 mask.
And a health care worker in Georgia has resorted to scouring local hardware stores in an effort to secure the protective masks… Nearly all who responded said there were shortages of PPE [personal protective equipment] in the hospitals, outpatient clinics and offices where they worked.
Many reported being forced to ration or reuse supplies, including surgical and N95 masks, for fear of running out. Many also said they were facing shortages of basic sanitary supplies, including hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.
Americans Endure Financial Hardship, Loss of Civil Liberties
With at least half the country in some kind of “lockdown” that requires Americans to lose their income and their freedom in order to comply with federal quarantine guidelines and state quarantine laws, following is a selection of media reports about what they are being told to endure during the COVID-19 public health emergency:
Jail Time for Quarantine Breakers. On Mar. 13, an Austin, Texas station reported that53 the Austin-Travis County Health Authority is taking legal action against those ordered to quarantine in their homes and anyone breaking quarantine could get up to 6 months in jail.
If the Health Authority believes someone “is ill with, has been exposed to, or is the carrier of” COVID-19, the order also prohibits the person from having people over to their home “without the prior approval of Austin Public Health.”
People under quarantine cannot “congregate in settings such as grocery stores, movie theaters, etc,” and must record their own temperatures and give that information to the Health Authority in phone calls conducted up to two times each day during quarantine, which usually lasts 14 days.
Quarantine Shaming. On Mar. 19, Associated Press reported that many Americans were being subjected to criticism and shunning if they choose not to or cannot strictly conform with recently enacted “social distancing” rules:54
“Quarantine shaming”—calling out those not abiding by social distancing rules—is part of a new and startling reality for Americans who must navigate a world of rapidly evolving social norms in the age of COVID-19. As schools close and shelter-in-place orders sweep across the U.S., the divide between those who are stringently practicing self-isolation and those who are still trying to go about some semblance of a normal life has never been more clear.
Complicating matters: What was socially acceptable even 48 hours ago may now be taboo, as government officials race to contain the virus with ever-expanding circles of social isolation.”
Scolding the Public. After cancelling the St. Patrick’s Day Parade, which has been held every year since 1772, on Sunday Mar. 22, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio scolded New York City residents for going to parks. According to Associated Press, Governor Cuomo said he was “exasperated” that people are ignoring his social distancing orders and are clustering in groups and acting like it was just another nice spring weekend.”55 Governor Cuomo was quoted as saying:
There is a density level in New York City that is wholly inappropriate. This is just a mistake! It is a mistake! It is insensitive. It is arrogant. It is self-destructive. It’s disrespectful to other people and it has to stop and it has to stop now. This is not a joke and I am not kidding.
You Are Your Safest Sex Partner. According to an article in Newsweek,56 the day before on Mar. 21, the New York City Health Department issued guidance for residents of New York City about how to have safe sex during the coronavirus outbreak.
Advising residents to stay home and minimize contact with others, the fact sheet posted on the health department’s website stated “you are your safest sex partner” because it “will not spread COVID-19, especially if you wash your hands (and any sex toys) with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after sex.”
The Health Department also instructed people to “disinfect keyboards and touch screens that you share with others (for video chat, for watching pornography or for anything else).”57
Temperature Taking Before Entering Supermarkets? On Mar. 22, Dr. Anthony Fauci told Science Magazine that requiring Americans to have their temperatures taken before they enter a supermarket like was done in China is “something that should be considered.” He added,
“I will bring it up at the next task force meeting and see whether there’s some sort of a logistical, bureaucratic reason why it can’t be done. The rationale for doing it is at least worth serious consideration.”58
Using Drones to Drive People Indoors. On Mar. 23, International Business Insider said that, “law enforcement in California is using drones to make sure that people do not flout quarantine measures amid a lockdown in the state.”59
After the Governor of California declared a state of emergency and told residents they had to stay in their homes and only leave to buy essential supplies and medicine, police in a city near San Diego (Chula Vista) purchased two $11,000 drones with speakers and night vision cameras “to drive people indoors” during the lockdown.
China was the first country to use drones to reprimand citizens who didn’t obey COVID-19 quarantine rules and then France and Spain began using drones to warn people to return to their homes.60 Some nations, like India, have taken harsher measures. The government has warned the population of over 1.3 billion people that anyone defying the coronavirus lockdown order could be shot.61
Banning Partners and Doulas at Births in Hospitals. On Mar. 24, The Hill reported that:62
Expectant mothers planning to give birth at two leading New York City hospital systems will not be able to have spouses, partners, midwives or doulas present, despite a mother’s birth plan.
Hospital networks NewYork-Presbyterian and Mt. Sinai Health have limited their visitor policies to ban family members, spouses and birth coaches from delivery rooms in an effort to further reduce the spread of the coronavirus in medical settings.
124,000 US Public and Private Schools Closed. On Mar. 27, Education Week reported that
“School closures due to coronavirus have impacted at least 124,000 U.S. public and private schools and affected at least 55.1 million students.”
Schools are closed in all 50 states currently. In California, New Jersey and North Dakota, schools are closed until further notice. The states of Kansas, Virginia, Oklahoma, Alabama, Vermont, Nebraska and New Mexico have announced schools will not open again this school year.63
“Do Not Resuscitate” the Infected?
On Mar. 26, The Washington Post reported that hospitals are debating “how to weigh the ‘save at all costs’ approach to resuscitating a dying patient against the real danger of exposing doctors and nurses to the contagion of coronavirus.”
The discussion is being driven by the nationwide shortage of personal protective equipment—such as masks, gowns and gloves—and questions being raised about whether it is worth the risk to hospital staff to “justify the conventional response when a patient ‘codes,’ and their heart or breathing stops.”
According to The Washington Post:64
Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago has been discussing a universal do-not-resuscitate policy for infected patients, regardless of the wishes of the patient or their family members—a wrenching decision to prioritise the lives of the many over the one…
Officials at George Washington University Hospital in Washington say they have had similar conversations, but for now will continue to resuscitate Covid-19 patients using modified procedures, such as putting plastic sheeting over the patient to create a barrier.
The University of Washington Medical Centre in Seattle, one of the country’s major hot spots for infections, is dealing with the problem by severely limiting the number of responders to a contagious patient in cardiac or respiratory arrest.
Earlier in March, The Atlantic reported that doctors in Italy had begun employing a utilitarian rationale to justify denying medical care to elderly COVID-19 infected patients or those with underlying conditions that raised their risk for death.65
The Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published guidelines for the criteria that doctors and nurses should follow, comparing “the moral choices Italian doctors may face to the forms of wartime triage and, rather than providing intensive care to all patients who need it, instead apply “distributive justice and the appropriate allocation of limited health resources.”
The approach that is being taken in Italy is based on utilitarianism, which uses a mathematical model as a guide to public policy that justifies sacrificing the few in order to maximize benefits for a greater number of people.
When making intensive care decisions, the doctors would follow criteria that guarantees only patients with “the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care” and the rules would apply to all patients, not only those infected with coronavirus.
They have discussed that “it may become necessary to establish an age limit for access to intensive care.”
Those who are too old to have a high likelihood of recovery, or who have too low a number of ‘life-years’ left even if they should survive, would be left to die.
Deliberately infect Vaccine Trial Participants with COVID-19?
In another unprecedented development regarding medical ethics, on Mar. 25, MIT Technology Review reported that,
“A group of academics say that 100 altruistic young people should volunteer to get a vaccine for Covid-19 and then be infected with the coronavirus on purpose.”66
The academics admit that a “challenge trial” is controversial but argue it could speed up testing of a vaccine to prove it does or does not work.
According to MIT Technology Review:
No one, though, has yet had virus squirted up their nose on purpose, something that is ethically dubious under most circumstances. The drawback is obvious, the authors admit: “Challenging volunteers with this live virus risks inducing severe disease and possibly even death.
It’s likely that if a challenge trial occurs, plenty of volunteers would sign up. After all, first responders, EMTs, health-care workers, and even grocery store clerks are already putting themselves at risk of Covid-19 by staying on the job. It may seem impermissible to ask people to take on risk of severe illness or death, even for an important collective gain,” the authors of the challenge proposal write. “But we actually ask people to take such risks for others’ direct gain every time we ask volunteer firefighters to rush into burning buildings.

Italian Epidemiologist: Many Questions but No Clear Answers on Covid19,"       

by Tom Jefferson
bmj.com
Excerpts:
Because of my background as an epidemiologist and Cochrane researcher, and my involvement in the H1N1 outbreak, I often get stopped in the street, or in a bar, or the gym, and asked about covid-19.
The questions are usually: how long does it take for the symptoms to manifest? How can I avoid it? Is it serious?
I live in Italy, the third most hit country in the world, my youngest children go to school locally, and my grandchildren are due to come over to Italy soon to see us.
The tone of my answers is usually dismissive. I explain the nature of influenza-like illnesses, the fact that it is a syndrome, there is not a single cause, and the gallery of “culprits” increases as time goes on.
But it is mysterious, it comes and goes. That is why it is called influenza, as our forefathers ascribed its waxing and waning to the influenza degli astri, or “influence of the planets.” Meaning they had not a clue as to where and how it started and where it went. We are still clueless.
There is, however, one question that my Italian friends often ask me to which I have no answer: how is this different from the seasonal influenza-like illnesses we are used to? Mario, a weight training paramedic, looked to me as the font of all knowledge, but I think his faith is misplaced.
To begin with I muttered something about bats, birds, wet markets, a novel virus and so on. I deftly got on with what I was doing, but I was left with a nagging feeling of ignorance.
Well, the virus serotype is new, sure, but is that enough to justify the frenetic media attention? Cases increased rapidly in China and then, of all places, here in Italy, and so have the number of deaths.
Even though no one knows for certain how many people die of influenza every year, 2828 deaths in the space of three months compared to the nearly 900 000 deaths a month in China alone for all causes (mainly cancer and cardiovascular accidents) does not sound like much.
And how do 86 deaths worldwide (excluding China) compare with deaths from influenza and influenza-like illness? Do not bother looking it up: we do not know.
Perhaps the death rate, the ratio of confirmed cases to deaths, could explain the furore? It seems to be anything between 0.18% to 4.9% (depending on where you look), on average below that of other coronavirus outbreaks. And deaths seem to be concentrated in older age groups and in people with pre-existing morbidities.
So I cannot answer my nagging doubts, there does not seem to be anything special about this particular epidemic of influenza-like illness.
There are, however, two consequences of this situation that bother me.
The first is the lack of institutional credibility as perceived by my friends. They range from firefighters, policemen, and even a GP—not the kind of people you would want to alienate in an emergency. A restaurant owner told me he would never report himself to the health authority as that would mean at least two weeks of closure and his business would go to the wall.
Jokers and spoofers are doing overtime on the web. The authorities cried wolf in 2005 and 2009 with influenza and see what you get now.
The second is that once the limelight has moved on, will there be a serious and concentrated international effort to understand the causes and origins of influenza-like illnesses and the life cycle of its agents?
Past form tells me not, and we will go back to pushing influenza as a universal plague under the roof of the hot house of commercial interest. Note the difference: Influenza (caused by influenza A and B viruses, for which we have licensed vaccines and drugs), not influenza-like illnesses against which we should wash our hands all the year round, not just now.
Meanwhile, I still cannot answer Mario’s question: what’s different this time?
Tom Jefferson is an an epidemiologist and Cochrane researcher, based in Rome, Italy.

The Failure of the Influenza Vaccine According to the Medical Literature,"       

Vaccine Failures, Part 3: Influenza Vaccination
by The Children’s Health Defense Team
[Note: This is the third in a series of articles examining the serious problem of vaccine failure—a problem that, scandalously, remains unacknowledged by the public health officials and politicians promoting draconian vaccine mandates. Previous articles examined measles and pertussis vaccination.]
Each year, U.S. public health officials and their media partners renew the campaign to sell the entire country (including pregnant women, six-month-olds and fragile senior citizens) on the need for and benefits of flu vaccines.
Ordinarily, to persuade the public that a given vaccine is beneficial, officials must show that it is effective—in other words, that it is able to “prevent outcomes of interest in the ‘real world.’”
However, influenza vaccination’s infamous ineffectiveness makes this talking point a bit tricky. And when vaccination does not “significantly reduce medically attended influenza illness,” it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the vaccine has bombed.
As public health experts are well aware, many factors can lessen influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), including particular characteristics of vaccine recipients and the vaccines themselves.
The scientific literature also points to serious wrinkles that underscore influenza vaccination’s inability to deliver meaningful benefits and its propensity to create new problems. For example, studies show that getting flu vaccines year after year reduces the level of vaccine protection available; flu-vaccinated individuals are also more susceptible to other strains of influenza and severe respiratory infections.
Recent studies even suggest that childhood influenza vaccination can lead to larger epidemics and “an overall health loss.” A vaccine expert who recently admitted to knowing less about influenza today than a decade ago lamented,
“It’s much more complicated than we thought.”
Failure #1: Influenza vaccination has been 40%-90% ineffective over the past 15 years.
Thus far for 2019-2020, the CDC says that it can only speculate about how well the season’s influenza vaccines “might work” [emphasis added]. To compensate for this vagueness, the agency touts VE in past seasons as being “in the range of 40% to 60%” (a range that vaccinologists would consider abysmal for any other vaccine). What the CDC does not mention is that last year (2018-19), overall VE (across all age groups and influenza viruses) was a mere 29%, and for the pesky influenza A(H3N2) viruses that predominated after
February 2019, flu vaccines were ineffective 91% of the time. Moreover, VE has attained the CDC’s vaunted upper limit of 60% only once in the past fifteen years; in over half (8/15) of the years since 2004, influenza vaccines have failed 60% or more of the time—including 90%, 79%, 81% and 71% in 2004-05, 2005-06, 2014-15 and 2018-19, respectively.
Failure #2: Influenza vaccine effectiveness is highly inconsistent and ignores immune system complexities.
More so than with other vaccines, researchers view influenza viruses as “dynamic” and influenza VE as a “moving target.” These characteristics have thwarted efforts to develop effective vaccines, with dramatic seasonal fluctuations in VE being the inevitable result.
Under such circumstances, influenza vaccines theoretically will be most effective when manufacturers correctly guess which strains of virus to include in a given year’s vaccines. In practice, however, influenza vaccines also “stand out for their variable effectiveness by age group . . . and by recent vaccination status,” suggesting an important role for immune history as well.
Illustrating the “complex host-virus interactions that affect vaccine protection,” some researchers hypothesize that imprinting—how a person’s first influenza infection “shap[es] immune memory . . . over the individual’s lifetime”—may play a key role in subsequent infection risks.
Proponents of this hypothesis point to a study showing that vaccination tampered with protective childhood imprinting in a cohort of 35–54-year-olds; vaccinated individuals in that age group had a more than four-fold increased risk of illness from certain circulating influenza viruses compared with same-age unvaccinated individuals.
In another example of how immune factors influence VE, studies show that obese individuals have a decreased response to seasonal flu vaccines compared with non-obese individuals.
Researchers explain this by noting that overweight introduces changes in metabolism that alter and age immune system cells; one researcher says that a 30-year-old obese person’s immune cells look “a lot like what you might expect in an 80-year-old individual.”
Failure #3: Influenza vaccine effectiveness dwindles with repeated vaccination.
A 2020 study published by Canadian researchers assesses the impact of repeated influenza vaccination on “current season” VE, furnishing results that will hardly be good news for proponents of annual vaccination.
The study included senior citizens with laboratory-confirmed influenza who were at least 65 years old at the time of vaccination, examining the impact of prior vaccination for up to 10 previous flu seasons—the first study to review such a long time period. In seniors who received a vaccine in 2015-16 but none in the preceding decade, VE was an unimpressive 34%, but it was significantly worse when accounting for 10-year vaccination history—26%, 24%, 13% and 7% in those who received 1-3, 4-6, 7-8 or 9-10 vaccines in the prior decade, respectively.
A Spanish study of older (> 60 years) influenza patients documented low VE (20% or lower) with just one prior vaccination.
What about at the younger end of the age continuum?
The authors of a 2017 meta-analysis point out that, based on average life expectancy and current vaccine recommendations, a child born in 2017 can “expect to receive 70-80 annual influenza vaccinations” over the course of his or her lifetime—but the effects of so many annual vaccines “on individual long-term protection, population immunity, and virus evolution remain largely unknown.” Another researcher—commenting on why influenza vaccines so often fail—remarks that flu vaccination programs are “predicated on assumptions on top of assumptions.”
The authors of the 2017 meta-analysis note that “signals of concern regarding potential negative effects of repeated vaccination” are nothing new, having first been observed in the 1970s and 1980s.
In their conclusions, not only do these authors argue that repeated vaccination “blunts” the antibody response—particularly for the H3N2 influenza viruses that caused U.S. vaccine effectiveness to plummet in 2019—but that the long-term immune effects of “blocking natural infection in healthy individuals with a low risk of influenza complications are unknown.” Their take-home message, again, is hardly reassuring:
Our current understanding of repeated vaccination effects is inadequate to inform vaccine policy recommendations.
Failure #4: Influenza vaccines can increase recipients’ susceptibility to non-vaccine influenza viruses and other acute infections.
In the aftermath of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, two Canadian researchers reported a more than two-fold increased risk of H1N1 illness in individuals less than 50 years who had received a 2008 seasonal flu vaccine.
To explain this finding, one of the investigators theorized that the seasonal vaccine “protected against an H1N1 virus that was related to—but not similar enough to—the pandemic virus,” which “might actually have facilitated infection with the pandemic virus.”
Although the Canadians characterized the 2009 pandemic as relatively mild, they observed that “a potential doubling of pandemic infection risk among prior seasonal vaccine recipients could be disastrous in the event of a more severe pandemic involving a higher per-case fatality risk.”
Not long after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, other investigators reported on the potential for vaccination programs to shift influenza infections in such a way as to produce less favorable outcomes—a scenario rarely considered during pandemic planning. They hypothesized
“that vaccinating to prevent a fall pandemic wave might delay it long enough to inadvertently increase influenza infections in winter, when primary influenza infection is more likely to cause severe outcomes [and] potentially cause a net increase in severe outcomes.”
A 2012 study of 6–15-year-olds found that children who received a seasonal influenza vaccine (versus placebo) were more susceptible to acute noninfluenza respiratory viruses in the nine months following vaccination, whether during winter or summer.
In an effort to explain this unexpected result, the investigators discussed the phenomenon known as “virus interference” and speculated that vaccination “could increase influenza immunity at the expense of reduced immunity to noninfluenza respiratory viruses, by some unknown biological mechanism.”
Interestingly, a 2020 study of virus interference in highly vaccinated U.S. military personnel reported an increased odds of coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (a virus that causes respiratory infections) in personnel who received influenza vaccines, although the findings pointed in the opposite direction for the other noninfluenza viruses examined.
Failure #5: Many influenza vaccine researchers are disingenuous or worse when they report on vaccine effectiveness.
As Children’s Health Defense has enumerated elsewhere, the proponents of flu vaccines—whether public health officials, the media or researchers—are only too willing to provide misleading information. A multicountry study funded by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and authored by GSK employees and shareholders—published in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal in 2019—furnishes an illustrative example:
The GSK authors report that they evaluated a “total vaccinated cohort” of 12,018 children; however, a companion publication clarifies that only 6,006 actually received the GSK-manufactured influenza vaccine.
The remaining 6,012 children comprised a control group, a group the researchers describe as “unvaccinated”; in fact, these children received one of three “non-influenza control vaccines” (hepatitis A, varicella or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine)—presumably also GSK brands.
The researchers did not start collecting illness information until 14 days after vaccination, precluding any consideration of short-term post-vaccination adverse events. Without information about adverse events in influenza-vaccinated children, it is impossible to assess the risk-benefit context of the authors’ conclusion that 19 children would need to receive the vaccine to prevent one case of influenza or that 6,024 children must get a vaccine to prevent one case of severe influenza.
The researchers admit that they focused exclusively on “pre-specified symptoms,” limiting their ability to capture the “whole clinical picture.”
They report “little difference” in severity scores for influenza-like illness and lower respiratory illness between the two groups but describe a lower rate of fever in the influenza-vaccinated group. However, they make no mention of clinical trial data showing that fever is a “very common” reaction to GSK’s hepatitis A, chickenpox and pneumococcalvaccines.
A Dutch study recently reported that childhood influenza vaccination “is not cost-effectivewhen only outcomes for the children themselves are considered.”
Analyzing the risk of undesirable outcomes—such as “a decrease of health or an increase in the number of severe influenza seasons after introduction of the influenza vaccination program for children”—the Dutch researchers produced worrisome models showing that “serious strain on the health care system” or “a net health loss” could result from childhood influenza vaccination.
Given the many ambiguities present in the GSK study, one wonders whether it could be masking similarly discouraging findings.

Failure #6: Flu vaccine hype is just that—hype. 
Is the annual flu vaccine sales pitch (evident not just in the U.S. but around the world) working? Given predictions of a 50% increase in the global influenza vaccine market by 2023 (from $5 billion to $7.5 billion), it would seem so.
On the other hand, recent estimates of influenza vaccine coverage in U.S. adults show that Americans are growing more, rather than less, skeptical.
In 2017-2018, influenza vaccine coverage fell for every adult age group (and all but one racial/ethnic group), reaching the lowest level in eight flu seasons. While influenza researchers may be “hesitant to discuss problems with the vaccine ‘because they’re afraid of being tainted with the antivaccine brush,’” we must hope that members of the public will recognize the importance of reviewing flu vaccine facts very carefully.

Did Bill Gates & World Economic Forum Predict Coronavirus Outbreak? Will There be an Internet Blackout to Control Information?,"       

Comments by Brian Shilhavy
Editor, Health Impact News
The Coronavirus outbreak in China now dominates worldwide news media outlets.
Spiro Skouras released a video yesterday (Jan. 25, 2020) reporting on a 5 hour simulation that was conducted in October of 2019: Event 201.
It was hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
The simulation is eerily similar to what is happening right now with the Coronavirus outbreak. Will world health authorities now take action as is predicted in this simulation, and try to control the narrative of the outbreak by cutting off access to the Internet, or forcing social media companies to only allow the information they want the public to receive?
Health Impact News is part of the independent alternative media, and sites like ours may soon be blocked from reporting on this emerging worldwide health crisis if this simulation is accurately predicting just how these events are about to unfold.
The mainstream media watch-dogs have labeled Health Impact News as “Fake” news, even when we report on vaccine injuries and deaths using the government’s own data. See:

Did Bill Gates & World Economic Forum Predict Coronavirus Outbreak? An Inside Look May Shock You!

by Spiro Skouras
In this report we take an inside look at Event 201, which took place in NYC on October 18 2019. Event 201 is a high-level pandemic exercise hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
This is extremely fascinating because this pandemic simulation exercise of coronavirus took place about 6 weeks before the first illness from the coronavirus was actually reported in Wuhan China!
That is one hell of a coincidence if you believe in that sort of thing. Another fascinating connection, is the fact that not only did the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation participate in and help set up the pandemic simulation of a coronavirus outbreak, but they just so happen to fund the group who owns the patent to the deadly coronavirus and are already working on a vaccine to solve the current crisis. Again an incredible coincidence…
In this report you will see footage from inside the event as the members of the emergency epidemic board in this simulation, which consists of representatives from major banks, the UN, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Johnson and Johnson, logistical powerhouses, the media as well as officials from China and America’s CDC just to name a few.
This simulation also includes news reports that were fabricated just for this exercise, please keep that in mind because they are eerily similar to reports we are currently seeing regarding this real world coronavirus outbreak.

Dr. Brownstein: Corona Virus is Nothing New – Here’s What to Do,"       

Corona Virus: What To Do
by David Brownstein, M.D.
DrBrownstein.com
I am sure you aware of the corona virus infection that is causing concern around the world. A January 24, 2020 study in The Lancet reported the latest statistics. (1) The fatality rate (so far) from the corona infection is approaching 15%. That is not good news.
There is a big HOWEVER here: This Lancet report is based on only 41 laboratory confirmed cases of the recent corona virus strain (2019-nCoV). Keep in mind, the 15% fatality rate is the percentage of hospitalized patients suffering with corona virus. There must be many more people who became ill with this corona virus and recovered uneventfully and therefore, did not seek care.
The symptoms of corona virus initially mimic the flu—fever, headache, cough, fatigue and muscle aches. The 41 patients admitted to the hospital all developed pneumonia.
Corona virus is nothing new. It has been with us for a long time. Corona virus can affect both animals and humans. It is important to keep in mind that most corona viral infections are mild. In the last two decades, there were two serious corona virus infections–severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which both had elevated death rates.
So, what can you do? Wearing a mask will not help protect you from becoming ill with any viral infection—corona virus included. I would check that off the list.
First, it is important to maintain optimal levels of nutrients, particularly vitamins A, C, and D.
Most people have suboptimal vitamin A and C levels. Both of these nutrients have antiviral abilities and are able to support the immune system when it is under viral attack.
If you are not ill, I suggest taking 3-5,000 mg/day of vitamin C. At the first sign of an illness, I would suggest taking 1,000 mg/hour until diarrhea develops, then back off for a time period.
For vitamin A, I suggest using 5,000 Units/day if you are not sick and 100,000 Units/day for four days at the first sign of an illness. Pregnant women cannot take these doses. (Note: Take vitamin A, not beta carotene.)
Also, vitamin D is very important for fighting infections.  I suggest, at the onset of an illness, taking 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/day for four days.
Iodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine.
As I have written in my book, Iodine: Why You Need It, Why You Can’t Live Without It, most of the population is low in iodine. If fact, iodine levels have fallen nearly 60% over the last 40 years.
The RDA for iodine is inadequate to supply enough iodine for all the bodily tissues. For the majority of my patients, I suggest taking 25 mg/day as a daily dose and more (sometimes 50-100 mg/day) at the first sign of an illness. Iodine can cause adverse effects and it is best used under the guidance of an iodine-knowledgeable doctor.
To prevent becoming ill and to avoid having a poorly responding immune system, it is vitally important to eat a healthy diet free of all sources of refined sugar. Refined sugar has been shown to negatively alter the functioning of the white blood cells for hours after ingestion.
Finally, it is important to maintain optimal hydration—drink water! Take your body weight in pounds, divide by two and the resultant number is the amount of water to drink per day in ounces. Dehydration ensures you will be much more likely to suffer serious problems from any infectious process.
Conventional medicine has little to offer to prevent or treat corona virus infections other than washing your hands–I agree with that one. It is time for you to take the initiative and learn what other therapies are out there. Your conventional doctor simply has no effective tools in his/her toolkit for this.
As for getting the flu shot? Fugetaboutit. It won’t help corona infections and there was a study which found an increased risk in non-influenza infections, including coronavirus, in those that received the trivalent flu vaccine. (2)
My last recommendation is to work with a holistic doctor who can give you nutrient IVs when you become ill. Vitamin C, hydrogen peroxide, and ozone IVs can help anyone suffering from an infection. At my office, The Center for Holistic Medicine, we have seen the positive results a holistic approach to combatting viruses can provide. To find a holistic doctor near you go to: www.icimed.com.

"Coronavirus: How Soon We Forget – Same Playbook, Different Virus","       

Coronavirus Pt 1: How Soon We Forget – Same Playbook, Different Virus
by Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, AOBNM. ABIHM
VAXXTER
I have been sitting back, listening to and watching the crushing plan “they” have designed for us. I have been viewing this fiasco through the lens of history.
I wrote this article to give you some perspective. I couldn’t help but think when this COVID19 blitz started, “How soon we forget…”
Over the last three weeks, unless you have been cloistered in a monastery in Tibet, you have been bombarded with at least 2.1 billion media mentions regarding a new form of coronavirus that has spread rapidly around the world. As a comparison, when Ebola was in the news last year, it received a mere 16.3 million media mentions.
The world economy has ground to a stop over the pandemic spread of coro­­navirus SARS-CoV2, the proper name for the virus. This name was chosen because the virus is genetically related to the coronavirus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003. ­Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, is the illness caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus. The two terms are used interchangeably but the words are not synonyms.
According to the CDC, coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes on their surface. There are 36 coronaviruses in the family Coronaviridae. The viruses are known to cause respiratory or intestinal infections in humans and some animals.
These common, mostly benign respiratory viruses were first identified in humans in the mid-1960s. 
The coronaviruses that commonly infect people are:
229E (alpha coronavirus)
NL63 (alpha coronavirus)
OC43 (beta coronavirus)
HKU1 (beta coronavirus)
These four common human viruses cause 10–20% of respiratory infections worldwide and are present on all continents. Most likely, you have been exposed to, and perhaps ill from, a coronavirus infection at some point in your life and may have some level of natural immunity to this virus.
Round #1, 2002: SARS – Coronavirus
The first reported case of the “mysterious flu” was reported in November 2002. Scientists went into high gear and found the pathogen to be a highly pathogenic coronavirus originating in the Guangdong province in China.
Experts were concerned because it had never previously been seen in humans. Named SARS-CoV, for “severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by a coronavirus,” its spread set off panicked alerts across the globe. The WHO issued its first global alerts in early March 2003, even though the majority of cases were limited to the Chinese province.
Ten years later a similar, highly pathogenic coronavirus called the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) would emerge in Middle Eastern countries leading to severe respiratory distress syndrome in humans.
Teams of experts were sent to investigate the SARS outbreak. The hysteria ramped up quickly and within weeks, the Hong Kong Department of Health issued an unprecedented quarantine order, keeping residents inside their homes.
Shortly thereafter, Mainland China followed suit, closing public schools, cinemas, and libraries in an attempt to stop the spread of the virus. As more cases began to be reported in Toronto, Canadian health officials warned residents to quarantine themselves, wear masks, and in some cases, just stay home.
Over the six month duration of the pandemic, 8,049 people tested positive for the virus. The vast majority of cases occurred in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, with a resulting 774 deaths, or close to 10% of known cases.
But since the total number of cases only represented those ill enough to seek medical help, the actual death rate is unknown and may have been far less.
In spite of the fact that few people in Canada were affected (251) and even fewer died (43), the Canadian Tourism Board estimated that the SARS epidemic cost the nation’s economy $419 million.
The Ontario health minister reported that the cost to the province’s health-care system, including money spent to develop special clinics and stock them with supplies to protect healthcare workers, was nearly $763 million.
SARS had a significant effect on the airline industry. Singapore Airlines lost $6 million each day during April and May when SARS choked off intra- and inter-Asian travel. Other less obvious industries that suffered during the outbreak were retail sales, hotels, and restaurants.
When translated into an absolute dollar amount, these figures imply that the global economic loss from SARS was close to $US40 billion in 2003. This figure is much greater than the medical costs of treating SARS patients.
Is this sounding familiar? 
As SARS-CoV faded into obscurity in 2004, and has never been seen again, a new pandemic was coming to the forefront. But this time, it was an influenza virus, H5N1, that was gaining the attention of the WHO and the mainstream media.
Influenza viruses are identified as three distinct immunogenic types—A, B, and C—and a large number of subtypes. Type C viruses are associated with either assymptomatic or very mild respiratory illness and do not carry with them a public health impact. Influenza type B infections also tend to cause minor illnesses. Having a propensity for older persons, influenza type B viruses are most often identified in nursing home outbreaks. Influenza types C and B have only been identified in humans.  Until the emergence of the H5N1virus, the only influenza A viruses associated with humans since 1977 have been H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2.
Influenza A subtypes have been designated as either mildly pathogenic, meaning they cause minimal or no disease, or highly pathogenic, meaning their presence has been associated with widespread infection.
Since the 1980s, all outbreaks of highly pathogenic influenza has been caused by antigen subtypes H5, H7, and H9.
Round #2, 2005: Bird Flu, H5N1
A pandemic by definition is an outbreak of an infection occurring over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affects a large number of people. By those standards, the bird flu exploded onto the world stage in May 1997 through an ironically innocent setting.
A Hong Kong pre-school had set up a small petting zoo on its grounds, making a home for five chickens and eight ducks. The children were delighted to spend time with their feathered friends.
Several days after the school aviary experience, a three-year-old boy began to cough. The illness and fever progressed rapidly, and the boy’s parents rushed him to Victoria Hospital where he was admitted with pneumonia and respiratory distress. Six days later, he died.
Pathologists found no underlying immunodeficiency or cardiopulmonary disease that would have contributed to the boy’s death. Three months later, the virus was confirmed to be avian influenza A virus with surface antigens H5N1. In a report published later, researchers held that this particular bird flu virus had not previously caused infection in humans.
Teams from the WHO and the CDC descended on Hong Kong to determine how the boy had been exposed to the bird flu virus and to assess the potential public health impact.
According to investigators, one of the chickens in the petting zoo had died several days before the child’s symptoms had appeared. It was postulated that the boy had been exposed to the ill bird, meaning, the virus had “jumped species” and had infected the boy.
In the following days and weeks, officials scrambled to determine if the virus had infected those who had been exposed to the ill child. Approximately 2,000 human samples were collected from those who had been in contact with the boy, the school’s petting zoo, or the birds from the rural areas; no additional cases were identified.
Then, a second case of H5N1 infection was confirmed in a person Hong Kong, and 18 more cases appeared over the following months. With news of the direct bird-to-human transmission, the CDC and WHO believed the next pandemic had arrived.
Again, is this sounding familiar?
Throughout the evolving epidemic, China denied the presence of bird flu in chickens or humans.
However, that changed in 2005 when China reported 7 human cases with three deaths to the WHO. All across the expansive country, millions of farmers were living in close proximity to billions of chickens, the reservoir of the H5N1 virus.
Reporting only seven H5N1 human infections seemed extraordinarily low. Many virologists around the world have questioned the relative absence of human cases, given there had been 30 highly pathogenic viral outbreaks in poultry across ten provinces throughout 2005.
China lied twice before; is there any doubt they could very well be lying now?
Round #3, 2009: Swine flu (H1N1)
In the spring of 2009, another pandemic siren shrieked across the US and around the world. This time, it was over a novel strain of influenza A.
When the origin of the virus was found to be in pigs from a small region in central Mexico, the outbreak became known as “swine flu” and the viral nomenclature was H1N1.
The WHO quickly declared a “public health emergency of international concern.” By June, the WHO and the CDC stopped counting cases and declared the outbreak swine flu to be a pandemic.
About that same time, experts around the world were saying that this H1N1 swine flu virus was not aggressive enough to cause a worldwide pandemic, noting that the mortality rate among confirmed cases was 1.6% in Mexico and only 0.1% in the United States.
At press conferences, various medical experts made remarks such as, “It is unclear if we need to use vaccines against the swine flu because the virus does not have a pandemic nature,” and “Does the world really need a vaccine for an illness that so far appears mild?”
Nonetheless, loaded with government funds, the Big Boys in vaccine manufacturing plowed ahead.
By September, Pandemrix, made by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), Focetria, made by Novartis and Arepanrix,a vaccine similar to Pandemrix and also made by GSK, was approved for use the following month.  Celvapan, a whole virus vaccine made by Baxter was approved but soon withdrawn from market because it caused extremely high fevers.
All of these vaccines were fast-tracked to market with no long term studies and very few test subjects in the trials. Let’s take a look at the ingredients*:
Pandemerix:

Adjuvant: AS03 which contains squalene (10.69 mg), polysorbate 80 (4.86 mg) and alpha-tocopherol (11.86 mg)
Other ingredients: egg proteins, polysorbate 80, octoxynol 10, thimerosal (mercury), sodium chloride, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, water for injections.

Focetia:

*For a detailed discussion regarding vaccine ingredients, see www.VaccineU.com and the 7-part course on Problematic Ingredients.
The pandemic vaccines were very problematic. In fact, Pandemerix was later shown to conclusively be associated with narcolepsy.
More than 1300 people who received a vaccine to prevent the flu developed narcolepsy, an incurable, debilitating condition that causes overpowering daytime sleepiness, sometimes accompanied by sudden muscle weakness in response to strong emotions such as laughter or anger. Worse, the vaccines did little to lower the death rate.
The pandemic began to taper off in November 2009, and by August 10, 2010, the Director-General of the WHO, Margaret Chan, announced the end of the H1N1 pandemic. The CDC estimates that between April 12, 2009 to April 10, 2010, there were 60.8 million people infected, with 274,000 hospitalizations, and 12,469 deaths – a mortality rate of 0.02% due to the virus.
Again, is this sounding familiar?  Millions infected; low mortality rate. No economic cataclysmic events, no “social distancing”, no masks, no community lock downs. 
Round #4, 2020: SARS-CoV2 – Coronavirus2
A third, highly pathogenic virus emerged out of Wuhan, China in December 2019. SARS-CoV2, the novel coronavirus, has rapidly spread across the globe and as of this writing, has affected more than 90,000 people worldwide.
Although China launched an early emergency response, the infection rapidly spread. In early January 2020, a total of 24 days after the index COVID-19 case in Wuhan, a family traveled from Wuhan Shenzhen, spreading the virus to that city. Subsequently, more cases were reported. From there, the virus seemed to transit the world.
Researchers were analyzing the data being accumulated from lab tests, nasal swabs, and stool samples. What they found was that common coronaviruses were the predominant strain identified, most likely due to their global distribution and their non-negligible mortality. This full-text article, from the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, reports:
As of 2 March 2020, 90,307 patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, with 3086 deaths (mortality rate 3.4%).
As of 2 March 2020, among OECD countries, 7476 patients had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with 96 deaths (mortality rate 1.3%)
As of 2 March 2020, in France, 191 people had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with three deaths (mortality rate 1.6%).
Between 1 January 2020 and 2 March 2020, 7,059 samples were positive for coronaviruses with two deaths. There were no cases of SARS-CoV-2 identified. The deaths were associated with strain OC43 and the other with strain HKU1. Underlying co-morbidities were not lists.
“This mortality rate of SARS-CoV2 In European or American developed countries of a comparable economic level the SARS-CoV2 mortality rate is 1.3%. This is not significantly different from that for common coronaviruses identified in the study hospital in France. (mortality rate 0.8%; p=0.11)
“In fact, mortality from respiratory infections is extremely dependent on the quality of care and access to care, and severe forms have better prognosis in countries with superior medical infrastructures.”
“Therefore, in OECD countries, SARS-CoV-2 does not seem to be deadlier than other circulating viruses.”
I hope that this historical discussion puts SARS-CoV2 and COVID19 into perspective. We are watching the same hysteria, the same fear-mongering, the same low death rates.
And this time, we may even have a medication, hydroxychloroquine, that eliminates the severe symptoms quickly. Get involved in preserving your right to refuse…because the vaccine is coming, even if the medications work.
In Coronovirus Part 2 – I’ll be discussing my perspective on why so many elderly died in Northern Italy.

Dr Brownstein: We are Not Worried About COVID-19,"       

Coronavirus VII: We Are Ready and You Can Be Ready Too!
by David Brownstein, M.D.
DrBrownstein.com
For over 25 years my office, The Center for Holistic Medicine  located in West Bloomfield, MI, has been effectively treating viral infections. The last few days I have seen the panic that is occurring: schools are closing, college students sent home, and all large events are being cancelled.
Rather than a time to panic, this is a time to reflect on our health care system and how to ensure that your immune system is ready to fight COVID-19 (the present coronavirus infection).
Conventional medicine’s approach to COVID-19 is suboptimal. They can offer hand washing and quarantining. That is about it. Really, it is pathetic!!
At my office, we are not worried about COVID-19. As I mentioned above, we have been successfully treating coronavirus, influenza, rhinovirus and many other viral flu-like illnesses since 1993. That is a long history.
The media and the Powers-That-Be would have you believe that this is the first-time coronavirus has ever infected humankind. That is simply not true. In fact, about 20% of common colds are caused by…coronavirus. (1) It is important to know that coronaviruses have been around for hundreds of years. I know this strain is different, but all viruses change (mutate) on a yearly basis. In fact, the influenza virus changes during every flu season. As I previously stated, I have been treating these viral changes for over 25 years.
My partners (Dr. Nusbaum, Dr Ng,  Taylor Eason, NP & Jenny Drummond, PA) have all found success using natural therapies to enhance the body’s immune system as well as to kill viruses including flu-like viruses. Today, I ordered intravenous hydrogen peroxide, vitamin C, ozone, and glutathione for my sick patients. I am confident these therapies will help them recover uneventfully. Keep in mind my partners and I have nearly 80 years of experience with these therapies! Not only do they work, they can be miraculous. Just ask our patients!
Intravenous nutrient therapies are wonderful treatments, but there are other oral natural therapies that are effective against viral infections including coronavirus. Vitamins A, C, and D along with iodine have proven benefit. At the first sign of any illness, I suggest my patients take 100,000 U of vitamin A (NOT beta-carotene), 50,000 U of vitamin D3 and 5-10,000 mg of vitamin C per day for four days. Pregnant women should not take high doses of vitamins A and D. Vitamin C can be increased to bowel tolerance.
What else can you do?
It is important to eat a healthy diet free of refined sugar, salt, oils, and flour. And, perhaps the most important thing is to maintain optimal hydration. That means taking your weight in pounds, divide the number by two and the resultant number is the minimum amount of water to drink in ounces per day. I cannot stress the importance of drinking optimal amounts of water.
I had my annual lecture last Saturday. My office manager, Ann, called me one week ago today and said she felt like she was getting sick. She started taking the above supplements (vitamins A, C, and D) and reported that next morning, “This stuff works. I feel totally normal. I am sure I was getting sick. I can’t believe how much better I feel.”
We hear the same results from our patients on a daily basis.
It is too bad hospitals refuse to use natural therapies on sick patients. That is when a patient needs it the most.
Intravenous hydrogen peroxide, vitamin C and ozone should be done in every hospital across the United States.
But, don’t hold your breath for that to occur. Over 20 years ago when I rounded on patients in the hospital, I ordered a nutrient IV that contained vitamin C and minerals.
Right after the order was registered, I received a call from the pharmacy department. The head pharmacist told me that was not on the formulary.
I replied,
“I don’t care. I wrote the order and I expect it to be done. I know you have the ingredients in the hospital.”
I was told I would have to contact the medical director and go in front of a committee to make my case. The medical director called me later that day telling me that IV would never be allowed. I told him I would not admit any more patients to that hospital.
As Forrest Gump said, “That’s all I have to say about that.”
Final Thoughts
Coronavirus is nothing to take lightly. It is also nothing to panic about. Yes, some will get very sick from it. Keep in mind that people get sick from many things. Viruses can cause serious problems. To minimize your risk, follow the instructions I have outlined for you here.
At the Center for Holistic Medicine we have been ready for COVID-19 for over 25 years. I look forward to seeing you at my office.
To All Our Health,

Coronavirus Patients in China to be Treated with High-Dose Vitamin C in New Clinical Trial,"       

by Andrew W. Saul, Editor
Orthomolecular Medicine News Service
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
(OMNS February 13, 2020) Breaking news: China is conducting a clinical trial of 24,000 mg/day of intravenous vitamin C to treat patients with coronavirus and severe respiratory complications. Participants will receive IV vitamin C for 7 days straight at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Honor and thanks are due to Zhiyong Peng, MD, for making this happen. He is chief physician and professor at the hospital, which is close to ground zero for coronavirus. This important study was filed and announced yesterday and details may be confirmed at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533
At Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, 24,000 mg of vitamin C will be administered to coronavirus patients, intravenously, each day for 7 days.
To fight a dangerous virus for which there is no existing medical treatment, you must rely on your own immune system. It is well established, in every nutrition textbook ever written, that you need vitamin C to make your immune system work well, or to even work at all. Inadequate vitamin C intake is a worldwide problem that can be immediately and economically fixed. With even modest amounts of supplemental vitamin C, deaths will decrease. In one study, a mere 200 mg of vitamin C/day resulted in an 80% decrease in deaths among severely ill, hospitalized respiratory disease patients. [Hunt C et al. Int J Vitam Nutr Res 1994;64:212-19.] http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n09.shtml
Another recent study used this same low 200 mg dose for infants and children under five years of age, with severe pneumonia. The authors concluded that
“Vitamin C is effective in reducing duration of severe pneumonia in children less than five years of age. Oxygen saturation was improved in less than one day.” [Khan IM et al. J Rawalpindi Med Coll (JRMC); 2014;18(1):55-57 http://www.journalrmc.com/volumes/1405749894.pdf ]
A lack of vitamin C has been long known, literally for decades, to increase susceptibility to viruses. http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n06.shtml
It is one thing to be sick from a virus and another thing entirely to die from a viral-instigated disease. The greatest danger with coronavirus is escalation to pneumonia. For this, much higher doses of vitamin C are indicated, preferably by IV.
How to administer high-dose intravenous vitamin C in hospital, Chinese language edition, is now posted for free access at http://www.doctoryourself.com/Coronavirus_Chinese_IV_C_Protocol.pdf.
This information is now being publicized all over Asia. Just because it is not on the American news channels doesn’t mean it’s not happening. It is. This is real news. The fake news is the media’s neglect in not reporting it. And here is the protocol in English, to make reporting all the easier: http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n07.shtml

Study: Social Isolation Leads to Higher Death Rates than Smoking or High Blood Pressure,"       

13 Studies Reveal How Social Distancing (i.e. Social Isolation) Can Increase Mortality
by GreenMedInfo.com
“A sad soul can kill you quicker than a germ” 
– John Steinbeck
Hundreds of millions of adults and children are now either in quarantine in their homes, or engaged in “essential” travel in the public sphere, while maintaining an unnatural distance from one another, because they have been told this is the best way to protect their individual and the public health from a deadly virus.
But what are the consequences of the social isolation caused by this mass social distancing experiment?
What Is Social Distancing and Social Isolation?
Social distancing, also known physical distancing, is defined as a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions taken to prevent the spread of presumably communicable diseases by maintaining a physical distance between people and reducing the frequency people come into close contact with each other.
Regardless of whether or not social distancing is actually effective in preventing disease transmission, it always results in some degree of social isolation, defined as disengagement from social ties, institutional connections, or community participation.
13 Studies Demonstrating Social Isolation Increases Mortality Risk:
There is a growing body of scientific research demonstrating that social isolation has significant adverse health impacts on both the psychological and physiological health and well-being of individuals, as represented by the following 13 studies which show significant increases in mortality:

In the 13th study listed above titled,  “Social Isolation: A Predictor of Mortality Comparable to Traditional Clinical Risk Factors,” researchers found that social isolation predicted mortality for both genders, and that social isolation was as strong a factor in their mortality risk as smoking, and even higher than having high blood pressure.  
Recently, another article worth reading titled, “The Pandemic America Forgot About,” echoed these health concerns: 
“Loneliness and social isolation have the same cardiovascular effects as smoking 15 cigarettes per day, but these factors also increase the risk of “all-cause morbidity,” in other words, dying from any cause. Loneliness increases the risk of developing dementia by 50% and stroke by 32% while increasing the morbidity risk of cancer by 25%.”
Social Isolation May Contribute To Increased Susceptibility to Infection
A study published in JAMA in 1997 titled, “Social Ties and Susceptibility to the Common Cold,” wherein the researchers evaluated the affect of a six-day quarantine on the susceptibility of healthy individuals exposed to two rhinoviruses linked to the common cold was found mediated by the level of social diversity present in their lives, i.e. ties to friends, family, work, and community, and found that “More diverse social networks were associated with greater resistance to upper respiratory illness”:
Abstract
Objective: To examine the hypothesis that diverse ties to friends, family, work, and community are associated with increased host resistance to infection.
Design: After reporting the extent of participation in 12 types of social ties (eg, spouse, parent, friend, workmate, member of social group), subjects were given nasal drops containing 1 of 2 rhinoviruses and monitored for the development of a common cold.
Setting: Quarantine.
Participants: A total of 276 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 55 years, neither seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus nor pregnant.
Outcome measures: Colds (illness in the presence of a verified infection), mucus production, mucociliary clearance function, and amount of viral replication.
Results: In response to both viruses, those with more types of social ties were less susceptible to common colds, produced less mucus, were more effective in ciliary clearance of their nasal passages, and shed less virus. These relationships were unaltered by statistical controls for prechallenge virus-specific antibody, virus type, age, sex, season, body mass index, education, and race. Susceptibility to colds decreased in a dose-response manner with increased diversity of the social network. There was an adjusted relative risk of 4.2 comparing persons with fewest (1 to 3) to those with most (6 or more) types of social ties. Although smoking, poor sleep quality, alcohol abstinence, low dietary intake of vitamin C, elevated catecholamine levels, and being i ntroverted were all associated with greater susceptibility to colds, they could only partially account for the relation between social network diversity and incidence of colds.
Conclusions: More diverse social networks were associated with greater resistance to upper respiratory illness.
This study argues for voluntary and not mandatory social isolation and quarantining. It is likey that when imposed from the outside on the healthy, it furthers the feeling of powerless and isolation. When self-administered, for example by someone who is not feeling well, it could actually be considered a measure of self-empowerment and self-soothing.
Clearly, social isolation has profound adverse psychobiological consequences that are not being taken into account by governmental health authorities intent on convincing the public that COVID-19 is the only relevant thread to our health and well-being in times of mandatory, indefinite, and near universal quarantines.
When you consider, also, that social distancing has destroyed the ability of people to make a living, it should be acknowledged that there are strongly positive epidemiological associations between unemployment and a wide range of adverse health effects; a 2015 study found that men experience up to an 85% increased risk of all-cause mortality following losing their jobs. Moreover, a 2020 Lancet study on the “Psychobiological effects of quarantine and how to reduce it,” found that “most of the adverse effects come from the imposition of a restriction of liberty.” The study noted:
These effects, as measured by increased morbidity and mortality, are likely to exceed those attributed to the theoretical risks of COVID-19 exposure.
Social distancing and isolation have real, evidence-based harms that must be accounted for when it comes to calculating the risks and benefits of quarantining the entire country, and the subsequent psychological, biological and economic consequences that follow such actions.
If you are interested in exploring the topic further, take a look at a recent survey posted on Stand For Health Freedom: Could unchecked government power be more dangerous than the threat of infectious disease?

A Scientific Look at Botanical Plants and Supplements Against Coronavirus,"       
Chinese herbal medicine.
by Richard Gale and Gary Null PhD
Progressive Radio Network
In recent weeks, the coronavirus pandemic has dominated the news at the expense of everything else that is critical and urgent in our lives. As panic increases and more cases are reported daily, health-minded people are eager or even desperate to know whether there are ways to strengthen the body’s immune system to offer some protection from this specific upper respiratory infection.
There are six known strains of coronavirus, four which are associated with the common cold or moderate respiratory infections. Everyone has likely had a coronavirus infection at some time in their lives.
However, two strains — Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) — are more severe. Between the years 2002-2004 and 2014-2018 these strains respectively were observed to be lethal.
However, during these periods, total deaths were under one thousand. SARS has the ability to infect the lower respiratory system as well.
The current strain being called Covid19 is a new mutation that is being recognized as a novel SARS. As of this writing, the current coronvirus has been attributed to over 4,000 deaths, the large majority among the elderly. In a recent press conference the Surgeon General remarked that the average age of death was 80.
Compared to other viral infections that target the respiratory tract, especially influenza, there has been far less research either to understand the pathway of infection and the drugs or natural substances to battle the virus. It remains uncertain how long immunity lasts, if any, after infection.
Seemingly, immunity wanes quickly. Consequently, since coronavirus is most often responsible for a flu-like common cold, recommended prevention and treatment protocols are largely similar to the flu.
Flu Shot Ineffective Against Coronavirus – May Actually Make it Worse
During a recent coronavirus task force meeting, Trump asked whether the flu vaccine would protect against the coronavirus. The flu vaccine is not only influenza-specific, it is also flu strain specific. It offers absolutely no protection to any other viruses.
Nevertheless we are going to likely witness a sharp rise in propaganda recommending flu vaccines to fight the coronavirus scare. The belief is that increasing national flu vaccination compliance will not only reduce the risks of flu infection but will also help divert money away from flu infections to better deal with the rising coronavirus cases.
But there is a caveat. A very serious caveat.
Sometimes the universe has an unusual way of providing warnings that we have an opportunity to either heed or disregard to our benefit or detriment.
On December 31, 2019 in order to usher in the New Year, China reported the first case of an “unusual pneumonia” in its port city of Wuhan. A week later on January 7th, the pathogen was identified as a novel strain of coronavirus.
That same month, the prestigious journal Vaccine, published a study conducted by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Researchers investigated viral interference due to receiving the flu shot; in other words, does the flu vaccine make a recipient more susceptible to other non-influenza respiratory viral infections? The study’s conclusions state
“Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus.”
This is not the first time that viral interference from the flu vaccine has been associated with an increase in non-influenza respiratory infections.
A much more thorough study, an actual clinical trial, was conducted by the University of Hong Kong in 2012. The double blind randomized controlled trial followed a group of flu-vaccinated versus placebo-vaccinated children between 6 and 15 years of age over the course of nine months to determine infection rates from 19 other respiratory viruses. The study found
“no statistically significant difference in the risk of confirmed seasonal influence influenza infection between recipients of the [influenza vaccine] or placebo.”
However, it was the dramatic number of incidences of non-influenza infections found in the flu-vaccinated group (105 cases), which included coronavirus, as opposed to 54 cases among those who received a placebo.
In other words, the results suggest that receiving the flu shot may increase one’s risk of contracting another infectious virus by almost 100 percent.
Coronavirus Infections More Severe Among Older People
A recent analysis out of China reviewing rates of infection, targeted populations and mortality reported that the worst hit group is older people, particularly those who have immune-compromised conditions: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory illnesses, etc.
Taking this statistic into account, we may note that the majority of American adults have some type of chronic condition. It is estimated that 60% of American adults have at least one underlying health condition and 40% have two or more.
For example, 33 million have diabetes and an estimated 84 million are pre-diabetic; heart disease affects 121 million and there are approximately 1.7 million new cancer diagnoses annually. All of these people, therefore, have either a mild to severe compromised immune system.
A Swiss study noted that the SARS coronavirus and influenza share two of the same proteases in targeted cells — TMPRSS2 and HAT. These are responsible for activating the spread of the virus at the point of infection and contribute to their pathogenesis in an infected cell.
Therefore it may be partially conjecture on our part to suggest that natural supplements and botanical remedies that have been shown in the scientific literature to be effective against influenza may more or less be effective against coronavirus as well.
In fact, last month a study was released by Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University in the Journal of Medical Virology recommending that patients’ nutritional status should be evaluated before any conventional treatment. The hospital recommended a regimen that included Vitamins A, B, C, D, E, Omega-3, Selenium, Zinc, gammaglobulin A administered intravenously and Chinese traditional medicine.
Therefore we have scoured the peer-reviewed literature on the National Institutes of Health’s Library of Medicine database to identify compelling studies that may warrant vitamin, antioxidant, and botanical supplementation as a means to protect ourselves from coronavirus and other viral infections.
These have been shown to either have strong antiviral properties in general or have known biomolecular effects to strengthen the immune system against microbial infection. We are not offering prescriptions. This is just a summary of some important scientific information for you to make better informed decisions for protecting yourself while the coronavirus wends its course. 
Traditional Chinese Medicine
BOTANICALS
Astragulus
In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), coronaviral infections belong to a specific epidemic disease category. Astragulus is not only a very popular plant used in TCM, but it is also one of the most researched and promising botanical plants shown to have antiviral properties.
In both TCM and Ayruveda medicinal formulas astrugulus has been prescribed for centuries because of its effectiveness against infections and over-stressed respiratory conditions. Compounds, notably saponins, found in astragulus have been well researched and found to hinder influenza proliferation. The US Department of Agriculture’s Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory found it inhibits avian flu viruses.
Jinlin Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China conducted a study published in the journal Microbiological Pathology that concluded
“Astragulus exhibits antiviral properties that can treat infectious bronchitis caused by [avian] coronavirus”
In China, which has a large poultry industry, avian coronaviruses are a serious threat to chicken farmers. Chinese farmers will often include astragulus in feed to protect the birds from infection as well as pig feed to ward off porcine circovirus.
Two weeks ago, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine completed an analysis of previous research looking at the benefits of Chinese herbal formulas against the SARS coronavirus and H1N1 flu (swine flu).
In 3 studies, among participants who took formulas against SARS, none contracted the illness. Nor did any contract H1N1 influenza in four additional studies. A primary ingredient in these formulas’ was astragulus.
Earlier in February, researchers at Beijing Children’s Hospital at the Capital Medical University provided a thorough overview of recommended diagnostic procedures and treatments for specific symptoms witnessed in the current Covid19 infections that included both allopathic and traditional Chinese medicine.
In cases where there are signs of severe weakness and stress observed in the lungs and spleen, a formula called Liu Jun Zi is being prescribed, which includes astragulus and ginseng as two primary botanicals.
Last week, the prestigious journal Science published a review out of Yun-nan Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China that investigated the great disparities in infection and mortality rates between different provinces – Wuhan being the most severe.
In the provinces with the lowest infection rates, there was between an 84% to 98% use of TCM formulas. Again, two of the main ingredients were Astragulus and Ginseng.
Licorice Root (Glycyrrhizin Acid)
In traditional medicine licorice root has been used to relieve and treat ulcers, sore throats, bronchitis, coughs, adrenal insufficiencies and allergic diseases. Ancient manuscripts from China, India and Greece all include licorice for treating respiratory tract infections and hepatitis.
Licorice’s main antiviral compounds are known as glycyrrhizins (GL). For 20 years Japan has used glycyrrhizins intravenously to treat chronic hepatitis B and C infections with very rare side effects.
It has also been shown to induce apoptosis in lymphoma cells and Karposi sarcoma related to herpesvirus. Therefore it was an unexpected surprise to discover that there is notable research on glycyrrihizin’s effectiveness against coronavirus and in particular SARS.
Japan’s National Institute of Infectious Disease reported GL’s effectiveness against coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as Epstein Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus. After the deadly SARS outbreak in 2012, virologists at Frankfurt University Medical School investigated several antiviral compounds to treat patients admitted with SARS coronavirus infections.
Of all the compounds tested, licorice’s GL was the most effective. The scientists concluded that:
“Our findings suggest that glycyrrhizin should be assessed for treatment of SARS.”
The above research was later replicated at Sun Yat Sen University in China and published in the Chinese journal Bing Du Xue Bao. The researchers identified several derivatives of glycyrrhizin as primary molecules with antiviral properties. In addition to being effective against the SARS coronavirus, they also found it may be effective against herpes, HIV, hepatitis and influenza.
Earlier in 2005, a team of scientists from Goethe University in Germany and the Russian Academy of Sciences had already identified the antiviral activity of GL against SARS coronavirus.
The molecule showed a ten-fold increase in anti-SARS activity compared to other potential treatments tested. One conjugate of GL had a 70-fold increase.
That study was published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry. During that same year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences screened over 200 botanical plants used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to find those with the strong potency SARS coronavirus. Four botanicals stood out. One of the four was licorice’s glycyrrhizin.
Extract of licorice root is the most effective and glycyrrhizin is also available as a separate botanical supplement.
Elderberry (Sambucus nigra)
Elderberry has become a popular supplement for relieving symptoms of the common cold and flu infections. It is found worldwide and is part of many of the world’s indigenous pharmacopias.
There are many species of elderberry; the species Sambucus nigra seemingly has been shown to have the most medicinal qualities. When purchasing Elderberry or Sambucus, it is recommended to note it is Sambucus nigra.
It is better to use a prepared formula rather than try to make it on your own from fresh berries and flowers. Elderberries contain cyangenic glycosides that can be poisonous and cause nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea and weakness.
Most research has focused on elderberry’s therapeutic value against influenza.
Hadassah University Hospital in Israel found that elderberry was effective in vitro against 10 different influenza strains. Cytokine activity for IL-1, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 all significantly increased thereby confirming its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.
Another Israeli study by Hebrew University in Jerusalem and published in the Journal of Internal Medical Research found that participants enrolled with existing flu like symptoms who took 15 ml of elderberry syrup 4 times a day recovered four days earlier than those on medications or a placebo.
Finally, a more recent 2019 study by the University of Sydney observed that certain compounds in elderberry inhibit the flu virus’s entry and replication in human cells.
However, there is also research showing elderberry’s positive impact on coronavirus infections.
In 2014, researchers at Emory University noted that elderberry extract inhibited coronavirus virility at the point of infection. The scientists hypothesized that elderberry rendered the virus non infectious.
One of the better studies came out of National Sun Yat Sen University and the China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan in 2019. The researchers used an ethanol extract of Sambucus stem (not the berry) and observed its potential against coronavirus strain NL63.
It is important to remember that deaths being attributed to the coronavirus are more often than not complicated by secondary infections that are usually bacterial such as pneumonia.
In addition to its antiviral properties, elderberry is also effective against pathogenic bacteria. Under laboratory conditions at Justus Liebig University in Germany, elderberry was shown to be very effective against several bacteria that are responsible for pneumonia during flu-like infections, and against Influenza A and B viruses in particular.
Echinacea
A systematic review of the existing research before 2011 by the University of British Columbia and published in the journal Pharmaceuticals, concluded:
“all strains of human and avian influenza viruses tested (including a Tamiflu-resistant strain), as well as herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinoviruses, were very sensitive to a standardized Echinacea purpurea preparation…”
There are different species of Echinacea. The species Echinacea purpurea  has been shown to be most effective and targets the most infectious pathogens. When purchasing echinacea, be certain it is the purpurea strain.
Echinicea does present limitations depending upon the severity of an infection. Once a cold caused by any one of the various cold viruses, including coronavirus, more deeply infects the bronchia and the lower lung, echinacea does not appear to be helpful. It is more effective with upper respiratory tract infections.
One of the largest placebo double blind studies on echinacea was conducted by Cardifff University in the UK. The study followed participants for four months and confirmed the safety of long term echinacea supplementation. It also observed a statistically significant decrease in cold episodes in the echinacea group.
There are no strong studies showing echinacea’s effectiveness against coronavirus. Up until 2014, only one study looked at its bioactivities against coronavirus and that was a mouse model which required high doses of the plant extract.
In 2012, Griffith University in Australia undertook one notable double blind study to determine whether echinacea provided protection to air travelers. The study concluded:
“Supplementation with standardized Echinacea tablets, if taken before and during travel, may have preventive effects against the development of respiratory symptoms during travel involving long-haul flights.”
As a piece of consumer advice, a Cornell University study looked at the medicinal properties throughout different parts of the echinicea plant: leaves, stems, bark, roots, etc. The scientists noted that only echinacea extracts that contain the root showed significant antiviral properties. Echinacea appears to modify the clinical course of flu-like respiratory infection by acting upon IL-8, IL-10 and IFN cytokine activity beneficially.
Olive Leaf
Oleuropein (OLE) is the most important biomolecule in the olive tree that contributes to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, anti-cancer, antimicrobial and antiviral activities and effects. One advantage of olive leaf is that it is highly bioavailable to the body’s cells.
There are almost 10,000 studies in the National Institutes of Health literature database referring to OLE, olive leaf, and olive oil, most with respect to its strong antioxidant and anticancer properties. According to analysis conducted by the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute in Rome of the oleuropein content in different parts of the olive plant, extracts made from buds and flowers showed the greatest strength and potency.
Olive leaf has not been shown to be particularly effective against viral upper respiratory infections; however there is considerable evidence to support olive leaf’s ability to strengthen the immune system against infectious viral diseases in addition to possessing many anti-inflammatory qualities.
There are only a few studies showing olive leaf’s effectiveness against respiratory viruses. One randomized trial performed by the University of Auckland in New Zealand suggests olive leaf can contribute to treating respiratory illnesses, including coronavirus. A 2001 study out of the University of Hong Kong identified 6 separate antiviral agents in olive that were effective against parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
Olive leaf is also effective against bacterial pathogens. Most bacterial pneumonias are gram-positive. According to a joint study by Arab American University and the University of Central Florida College of Medicine, OLE worked best against gram-positive pathogens but gram-negative organisms appeared to be resistant to OLE (eg, E coli, Salmonellas, etc.).
But OLE does possess notable anti-viral properties. The current Covid19 pandemic appears to utilize the host cell’s ACE2 receptor. This same receptor is also activated in HIV infections. This is one reason why patients infected with this new coronavirus strain are being prescribed HIV drugs. Therefore might olive leaf extract contribute to the treatment for this new coronavirus strain?
New York University biochemists identified olive leaf extract’s anti-HIV activity to modulate the host cell gene expression due to HIV infection. In fact, olive leaf extracts reversed HIV-1 infections. This was published in Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Research.  The conclusions state,
“Treatment with OLE reverses many of these HIV-1 infection-associated changes.”
Another joint study by NYU and Harvard Medical School concluded that OLE from olive leaf is “a unique class of HIV-1 inhibitors” and is “effective against viral fusion and integration.”
Oregano Oil
Oregano possesses a compound called carvacrol that has been shown to be antiviral. Although it has been tested on several influenza and flu-like respiratory viruses, it does not appear to have been tested against coronavirus.
Soochow University in China and the University of Oklahoma published a study in the BMC Journal of Complementary and Alternative Medicine focusing on oregano’s antiviral properties against influenza viruses. Although oregano did not kill the virus it nevertheless inhibited the virus’ ability to translate proteins responsible for the viral binding to cells.
A University of Putra Malaysia meta-analysis of existing research of different plant essential oils reported oregano was strongest against the flu-like viruses adenovirus and coxsackie virus.
A 2010 randomized double blind study study published in Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine suggested oregano was beneficial as a throat spray and showed significant and immediate improvement of upper respiratory infectious ailments.
University of Arizona published a paper in the Journal of Applied Microbiologyinvestigating oregano’s antiviral properties when used as a sanitizer. The study focused on one flu-like virus, novovirus. If sprayed on surfaces, carvacrol will kill the virus within 15 minutes of exposure. The most recent research into Covid19’s surface life — living outside of an animal host — is 9 days.
Other Botanicals
Saikosaponins is an important family of compounds found in the Bupleurum plant, which has been shown to have possible anti-coronavirus properties.
Kaohsiung Medical University in Taiwan examined many of the derivatives of saikosaponins and observed it has very potent anti-coronaviral activity that interferes with the early stage of the virus’ replication. Several companies offer Bupleurum online.
University College Dublin and Sichuan Agricultural University conducted a systematic meta-review of the existing medical literature on Chinese herbs that may prevent and treat viral respiratory infections. Among the most promising herbs against SARS coronavirus were panax ginseng, glycyrrhizin from licorice, and Isatis tinctoria, commonly known as woad or Asp of Jerusalem. Isatis is also available online.
Houttuynia cordata also known as fish mint, rainbow plant, fish wort, bishop’s weed is indigenous to Southeast Asia.  This botanical directly inhibits coronavirus’ protease and blocks the viral RNA polymerase activity. A study out of Tsinghua University in Beijing found it significantly reduces fevers, sore throat and coughs due to the SARS virus. Tinctures of this plant are available online.
SUPPLEMENTS
Vitamin C
Unlike the US, most of the world, especially in Asia and continental Europe, recognizes Vitamin C as an important anti-viral agent. It is also a remarkable antioxidant shown to ward off infections. At this moment, China is conducting several clinical trials with intravenous Vitamin C to treat patients infected with the Covid19 strain. The city government of Shanghai is now actively treating patients with intravenous Vitamin C.  A trial at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan is using 24,000 mg per day intravenously. The Wuhan study can be viewed on the US National Library of Medicine’s website here:  https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533
Until recently, Vitamin C has not been tested against coronavirus. There was  one study performed to see whether the vitamin protected chick embryo organs from infection by avian coronavirus — a very common infection in fowl. That study showed the vitamin positively increased embryo resistance against the virus. Otherwise, Vitamin C has only been well studied against other viral infections, especially influenza.
Seoul National University College of Medicine concluded that Vitamin C is an essential factor for anti-viral immune responses at the early stage of Influenza A infection.
In 2017 the University of Helsinki reviewed 148 studies that indicated Vitamin C may alleviate or prevent infections caused by bacteria and viruses. The most extensive indication studied was the common cold. Among people who are physically active, Vitamin C was most beneficial. However, many studies relied on very low Vitamin C doses, which likely contributed to the minor benefits observed.  Some of these were as low as 100 mg daily. In addition, the studies showed that colds’ duration was frequently shorter and less severe among people with sufficient Vitamin C levels.
An early randomized double blind trial to investigate Vitamin C’s ability to protect elderly hospitalized patients from acute respiratory infections was conducted at Hudderfield University in the UK. The study relied on a very low dose of 200 mg per day. Nevertheless, those who received the vitamin fared significantly better than those taking placebo.
Finally, there was another controlled placebo study involving 715 students between the ages 18-32 taking 1000 mg four times daily. The test group had an 85% decrease in flu and cold symptoms compared to the control.
Vitamin D
Barely a week goes by without another study appearing in the peer-reviewed literature that looks at either Vitamin D’s therapeutic characteristics or the risks of Vitamin D deficiency.
A high number of otherwise healthy adults have been reported to have low levels of vitamin D, mostly at the end of the Winter season. Deficiency rates vary between 42% for the entire population to 82% for Black Americans and 63% for Latinos.
People who are housebound, institutionalized and those who work night shifts are most likely to be vitamin D deficient. This includes many elderly people who receive limited exposure to sunlight.
It has been shown that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase risk in autoimmunity illnesses and greater susceptibility to infection. It also boosts up the body’s mucosal defenses which are critical for protecting ourselves from infectious respiratory viruses
Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital in conjunction with a global collaborative study to follow up on a Cochrane analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving 11,000 participants confirmed that vitamin D. taken daily or weekly significantly cut the risk of respiratory infections in half
Jikei University School of Medicine in Japan conducted a randomized double blind placebo trial to measure the rate that Vitamin D reduced seasonal influenza A. Almost twice as many participants in the placebo group came down with the flu compared to the Vitamin D group. The Japanese scientists also observed that people with a history of asthma were best protected.
For children, a Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia meta review identified 13 of 18 studies confirming that Vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased incidences of acute lower respiratory infection.
N-Acetyl Cysteine
Oxidative stress is a well known pathway for microbial infections such as viruses and bacterial pneumonia, especially in the lungs.
When the lungs are subject to serious oxidative stress, there is an increase in inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1, IL-8 and Tumor necrosis factor or TNF.  Each of these cytokines have been shown repeatedly in clinical research to play a role in different respiratory infections including influenza, coronavirus, echovirus, adenovirus, coxsackie virus and others.
Therefore, certain antioxidants can alleviate lung damage due to oxidative stress.
N-acetyl cysteine is one of these extremely important antioxidants. It exhibits both direct and indirect antioxidant properties. The indirect benefit is that it increases the concentration of another important antioxidant, glutathione, in the lung cells.
There is no confirmatory evidence that NAC directly targets flu or flu-like viral infections; however it has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of clinical symptoms.
Johann Goethe University Department of Virology observed that NAC inhibits the replication of seasonal human influenza A viruses by decreasing several these pro-inflammatory molecules. The scientists recommend that NAC should be included as an additional treatment option in the case of an influenza A pandemic.
An Italian randomized placebo study conducted at the University of Genoa found that subjects who were already suspected of having contact with the H1N1 flu virus who were placed under NAC treatment had a 25% rate of experiencing symptoms compared to 79% in the placebo group.
Certain cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor and IL-6, have been associated with the pathogenesis of influenza and can increase the risk of mortality. In a mouse study, Italian researchers at Zambon Research Center gave NAC to flu-infected mice with a significant decrease in mortality.
Colloidal Silver
Nanoparticle or colloidal silver has been studied extensively for its anti-bacterial properties but less so for infectious viruses. Most studies for silver’s antiviral activities have focused on HIV-1, Hepatitis B, herpesvirus and respiratory syncytial virus or RSV.
In a 2005 issue of the Journal of Nanotechnology, the University of Texas and Mexico University observed that silver nanoparticles could kill HIV-1 within 3 hours, and they suspected that this may be true for many other viruses as well. However, this conclusion may be too premature and more research is necessary.
There are studies showing silver’s efficacy against respiratory viruses. One large study by Japan’s National Defense Medical College Research Institute, published in the Journal of Molecular Sciences, recommended that Japanese healthcare workers take nanosilver to protect them from viruses including coronavirus.
In 2010, the University of Naples measured silver nanoparticles’ capabilities to reduce and prevent infection from the parainfluenza type 3 virus. The scientists hypothesized that the silver may block the virus’ interaction with the cell. Then a joint study by Deakin University in Australia and Osaka University in Japan found that colloidal silver significantly protected cells from H3N2 flu infection and prevented viral growth in the lungs
Finally, colliodal or nanoparticle gold has also been shown to inhibit the flu virus’ binding capaticity to a cell’s plasma membrane. That research was carried out by Freie University in Germany.
Conclusion
Yes, we should be concerned about the coronavirus’ high infectious rate. At the moment, the primary solution being sought to handle the crisis is to spend billions of dollars to develop an effective vaccine and an accurate diagnostic kit.
Additionally, according to a study out of Johns Hopkins University’s School of Public Health, the incubation period is estimated at 5.1 days for being infected and capable of infecting others without displaying symptoms. But there is no mention in the medical community nor the mainstream media about what we can do to strengthen our immune system.
Yes, a high quality 99% barrier mask is important, especially if worn in a crowded environment.
Repeated washing of our hands for a full minute with soap water. Rub surfaces with alcohol at home and work and allow it to sit for 30 seconds. Likewise, wipe down door handles and telephone receivers.
Quarantining people who have been exposed is important until they test negative.
Closing schools is prudent. And if a vaccine is eventually developed and shown to be safe and effective that is another recourse.
However none of the above protects the immune system in the event of coming into contact with the virus. We believe that the recommended natural solutions shared above, since they are supported in the peer reviewed scientific literature, are something everyone can do. Besides, it is safe and not expensive.
Therefore these natural solutions too should be considered as a viable and effective recourse to lessen this pandemic’s fatal effects.","March 10, 2020",https://healthimpactnews.com/2020/a-scientific-look-at-botanical-plants-and-supplements-against-coronavirus/
PhD Researcher Judy Mikovits and Expert on Viruses Explains the Coronavirus and Reveals Information You are Not Likely to Hear in the Corporate Media,"       

Comments by Brian Shilhavy
Editor, Health Impact News
TV Santa Barbara has published a recent interview with host Bob Lovgren interviewing Dr. Judy Mikovits explaining what the coronavirus is, how it got here, how it can be treated, and other important information you are not likely to hear in the corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media.
We have featured Dr. Mikovits’ work here at Health Impact News many times over the past few years. Here are some past articles:
Vaccines and Retroviruses: A Whistleblower Reveals What the Government is Hiding
As Government Denies Existence of Retroviruses, Big Pharma Prepares to Make Huge Profits from Treatment
She the author of the book Plague: One Scientist’s Intrepid Search for the Truth about Human Retroviruses and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), Autism, and Other Diseases, co-written by Kent Heckenlively, JD.
I had the pleasure of interviewing Dr. Mikovits a few years ago, just after a 4-year gag order on her had been lifted.
Dr. Mikovits’ bio is quite impressive, and would rival any of the talking head “experts” currently being featured in the corporate-sponsored media.
Judy A. Mikovits, PhD, earned her BA from University of Virginia and PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from George Washington University. In just over twenty years she rose from an entry-level lab technician to become director of the lab of Antiviral Drug Mechanisms at the National Cancer Institute before leaving to direct the Cancer Biology program at EpiGenX Pharmaceuticals in Santa Barbara, California.
There in 2006, she became attracted to the plight of patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Autism. In only five years she developed the first neuroimmune institute from a concept to a reality and is primarily responsible for demonstrating the relationship between immune based inflammation and these diseases.
She has published over 50 scientific papers.
Dr. Mikovits spoke the truth about the fraudulent use of government research money, the marketing of inaccurate retrovirus tests, Medicare fraud, the contaminated blood supply, and the harm that is associated with vaccines and their schedule of administration.
Her research showed how retroviruses are linked to the plague of modern illnesses that are bankrupting the U.S. healthcare system.
She was arrested without a warrant and held in jail for 5 days without the opportunity for bail as a fugitive from justice. Her career was destroyed.
Her story is documented in the book Plague: ​One Scientist’s intrepid Search For the Truth about Human Retroviruses and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Autism, and Other Diseases.
Please watch this presentation on the coronavirus. If this video becomes too popular, it will most likely disappear from the Internet.

New Study Exposes the “60% Effective” Flu Shot as 98.5% Useless,"       

by Dr. Mercola
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a yearly flu vaccine as “the first and most important step in protecting against flu viruses.”
This advice applies to everyone 6 months of age and older, and the CDC stresses that you “should get a flu vaccine as soon as [they] are available.”
With a promotion this strong, you might assume that getting a flu shot is a “sure thing” to protect you from all flu-like illness this year, but actually it’s not.
Not even close.
Most Flu-Like Illness is NOT Influenza
During the “flu season,” doctors and patients alike often attribute respiratory illness to “the flu” or influenza viruses when they most of the time flu-like symtpoms are actually associated with other types of viruses and bacteria.
The only way to know for sure what type of virus or bacteria is causing flu-ike symptoms is to have it lab confirmed.
The seasonal influenza vaccine only contains three strains of type A or type B influenza, which U.S. and WHO health officials select each year as the most likely influenza strains that will circulate around the world.
There are many influenza strains and most cases of flu-like illness that occur in the U.S. during a typical flu season are not associated with type A or type B influenza strains.
So, it is important to remember that, when you feel like you have the “flu,” you can’t automatically assume that your flu symptoms are caused by type A or type B influenza strains included in the seasonal flu vaccine. Also, people who do get a flu shot every year cannot automatically assume they will not get sick with either type A or type B influenza or another respiratory iillness that looks and feels like influenza.
Flu Vaccines Prevent the Flu in Only 1.5% of Adults
A new study in The Lancet Infectious Diseases reveals that the flu vaccine prevents lab confirmed type A or type B influenza in only 1.5 out of every 100 vaccinated adults … but the media is reporting this to mean “60 percent effective.”
It is estimated that, annually, only about 2.7% of adults get type A or type B influenza in the first place. The study showed that the use of flu vaccines appear to drop this down to about 1.2%. This is a roughly 60% drop, but that ignores the fact that the vaccine has no protective health benefit for 97.5% of adults. 
The researchers’ own conclusions are also somewhat more lackluster in their tone than the media would have you believe:
“Influenza vaccines can provide moderate protection against virologically confirmed influenza, but such protection is greatly reduced or absent in some seasons. Evidence for protection in adults aged 65 years or older is lacking.”
So where is the 60% effectiveness claim coming from? This number is based on relative risk, and it does not mean that 59 out of 100 people who get the flu shot will be protected against the flu … allow me to explain.
Why You Need to Understand Basic Statistics Before Getting a Flu Shot
Some clinical trials are only able to show a meaningful benefit because they focus on relative risk reduction rather than absolute risk reduction. What’s the difference? You can find a very simple explanation of relative risk vs. absolute risk at the Annie Appleseed Project web site, but let me sum it up here.
Relative risk reduction is calculated by dividing the absolute risk reduction by the control event rate
Absolute risk reduction is the decrease in risk of a treatment in relation to a control treatment
In plain English, here’s what that means: let’s say you have a study of 200 women, half of whom take a drug and half take a placebo, to examine the effect on breast cancer risk. After five years, two women in the drug group develop breast cancer, compared to four who took the placebo. This data could lead to either of the following headlines, and both would be correct:
“New Miracle Drug Cuts Breast Cancer Risk by 50%!”
“New Drug Results in 2% Drop in Breast Cancer Risk!”
How can this be?
The Annie Appleseed Project explains:
“The headlines represent two different ways to express the same data. The first headline expresses the relative risk reduction — the two women who took the drug (subjects) and developed breast cancer equal half the number (50%) of the four women who took the placebo (controls) and developed breast cancer.
The second headline expresses the absolute risk reduction — 2% of the subjects (2 out of 100) who took the drug developed breast cancer and 4% of the controls (4 out of 100) who took the placebo developed breast cancer — an absolute difference of 2% (4% minus 2%).”
You can now see why clinical trials, especially those funded by drug companies, will cite relative risk reductions rather than absolute risk reductions, and as a patient you need to be aware that statistics can be easily manipulated.
As STATS at George Mason University explains:
“An important feature of relative risk is that it tells you nothing about the actual risk.”
Flu Shot Protects Against Only Three Flu Viruses …
As stated previsously, each year the flu shot contains three influenza viruses — one influenza A (H3N2) virus, one seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus, and one influenza B virus. It only has a chance of preventing you from getting a flu-like respiratory illness during the flu season IF you so happen to be infected with one of these three specific influenza viruses.
In the United States, federal health officials at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are in charge of selecting which viruses to include in seasonal flu vaccine, a process that is based on international “surveillance-based forecasts about what viruses are most likely to cause illness in the coming season.” U.S. health officials works with World Health Organization (WHO) health officials to come up with projectons about which three type A or type B infuenza viruses should be included in seasonal influenza vaccine each year.
In other words, it’s an educated guess.
As you might suspect, getting a “good match” between the chosen vaccine virus strains and the actual influenza viruses that do end up circulating and causing most of the type A or type B influenza in the U.S. and around the world is challenging.
As the CDC notes:
“There are a number of factors that can make getting a good vaccine virus strain for vaccine production challenging, including both scientific issues and issues of timing. Currently, only viruses grown in eggs can be used as vaccine virus strains. If specimens have been grown in other cell lines, they cannot be used for vaccine strains. 
However, more and more laboratories do not use eggs to grow influenza viruses, making it difficult to obtain potential vaccine strains. In addition, some influenza viruses, like H3N2 viruses, grow poorly in eggs, making it even more difficult to obtain possible vaccine strains.
In terms of timing, in some years certain influenza viruses may not circulate until later in the influenza season, or a virus can change late in the season or from one season to the next. This can make it difficult to forecast which viruses will predominate the following season, but it can also make it difficult to identify a vaccine virus strain in time for the production process to begin.”
When you add to this gamble, the little-known fact that, according to the CDC, only about 20 percent of flu-like illnesses are actually caused by influenza type A or B, you realize how limited an effect the flu vaccine has on keeping people well during the flu season. Too many people assume that all flu-like illness is caused by influenza viruses when the truth is that about 80 percent of flu-like illness is NOT caused by type A or type B influenza. Most flu-like symptoms are actually associated with more than 200 other bugs that can make you feel just as sick — respiratory syncytial virus, bocavirus, coronavirus, and rhinovirus, to name a few.
What this means is that if you think you have the flu, odds are five to one that you actually don’t have the flu but a flu-like virus, against which the flu shot is absolutely worthless!
Is the Small Purported Flu Shot Benefit Actually due to the “Healthy User” Effect?
Lisa Jackson, a physician and senior investigator with the Group Health Research Center in Seattle, found that healthy people tend to choose flu vaccination, while the “frail elderly” didn’t or couldn’t. Her research suggested that flu vaccine itself does not reduce mortality at all.
Healthy (and health-conscious) people tend to get the vaccine AND come down with influenza less often, not because of the vaccine itself but because they are healthier to start with.
Jackson concluded:
“The reductions in risk before influenza season indicate preferential receipt of vaccine by relatively healthy seniors… the magnitude of the bias demonstrated by the associations before the influenza season was sufficient to account entirely for the associations observed during influenza season.”
Unfortunately, Jackson’s papers were turned down for publication in the leading medical journals, even though her hypothesis makes perfect sense.
Every day you’re around viruses and bacteria and, when you’re healthy, you usually don’t get sick. But even if you do get sick, most healthy adults and children will not have serious problems moving through and recovering from influenza or other flu-like illnesses. If you do come down with influenza and have a good immune response, you will likely recover quickly without serious complications, as well as obtain natural immunity to that strain of influenza and to similar ones.
As an aside, this is one more health benefit to achieving immunity naturally by experiencing and recovering from normal infectious diseases, such as influenza.
Vaccine-acquired immunity is temporary, which is why even though the viruses in this season’s flu vaccine are the same viruses that were selected for the 2010-2011 influenza vaccine, the CDC is still recommending you get vaccinated again, even if you got the vaccine last year. The immunity that healthy individuals get by recovering from influenza naturally is usually much longer lasting.
Why Are Vaccinated Kids Getting the Measles?
Vaccine effectiveness simply cannot be taken at face value, and this applies not only to the flu vaccine but also to other diseases, like measles. Measles cases have greatly increased in parts of Canada and the United States this year. Although unvaccinated children and teens are often blamed for driving the high numbers, a recent investigation into a measles outbreak in a high school found that about half of the cases were in teens who had received the recommended two doses of vaccine in childhood.
In other words, many of the cases were among those whom health authorities would have expected to have been protected from the measles virus. Conventional medical wisdom states that the measles vaccine should protect against measles infection about 99 percent of the time.
CBC News reported:
“So the discovery that 52 of the 98 teens who caught measles were fully vaccinated came as a shock to the researchers who conducted the investigation … If other groups confirm what the Quebec investigation found, it could mean there is a lot more susceptibility to measles in the vaccinated population than is currently being assumed.”
In the United States, the minimum age for the first dose of measles vaccine is recommended as 12 months, but this may actually render the vaccine ineffective. If a breastfed child is given a measles vaccine too early, their mother’s antibodies transferred to the baby via breast milk (which also protect the baby from measles disease naturally), canl interfere with the baby obtaining measles vaccine strain virus induced antibodies. It was, in fact, due to a high rate of measles vaccine failure that a second dose of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was introduced in the United States in 1991.
As noted by the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC):
“An MMR vaccine manufacturer states that in a study of 279 children 11 months to 7 years of age, MMR vaccine was shown to be 95 to 99 percent effective. Protection is estimated to persist for up to 11 years. In a measles outbreak in the U.S. in the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, it was found that there were a significant number of vaccine failures in older children, teenagers and adults, when the disease can be more severe. The government proceeded to recommend that a second MMR shot be given to boost immunity either before entrance to kindergarten or before entrance to junior high school.
In the national outbreak of measles during the late 1980’s and early 1990’s, it also became apparent that children who had been vaccinated before 15 months of age were also at risk for vaccine failure, especially if their mothers had recovered naturally from measles disease as children. 
An MMR vaccine manufacturer states “Infants who are less than 15 months of age may fail to respond to the measles component of the vaccine due to presence in the circulation of residual measles antibody of maternal origin, the younger the infant, the lower the likelihood of seroconversion.” The manufacturer goes on to advise that infants vaccinated at less than 12 months of age will have to be revaccinated after 15 months of age even though “there is some evidence to suggest that infants immunized at less than one year of age may not develop sustained antibody levels when later immunized.””<
Quite simply, vaccines do not confer the same type of immunity that exposure to the actual disease does …
Why the Herd Immunity Concept is Flawed

Typically, vaccine promoters will stress the importance of compliance with the vaccine schedule that requires multiple doses of a vaccine in order to create and maintain vaccine induced “herd immunity,” because a vaccine is never 100 percent effective. However, they never quite seem to be able to explain why the majority of outbreaks occur in areas that are thought to HAVE herd immunity status, i.e. where the majority of people are vaccinated and “should” therefore never get the disease.
The problem is that there is, in fact, such a thing as natural herd immunity. But what has happened is that public health officials have taken this natural phenomenon and assumed that vaccine induced herd immunity is the same as disease induced herd immunity and it is not the same. The science clearly shows that there’s a big difference between naturally developed herd immunity and vaccine-induced herd immunity in a population.
To learn more, I urge you to listen to the video above, in which Barbara Loe Fisher and I discuss the concept of herd immunity.
“The original concept of herd immunity is that when a population experiences the natural disease… natural immunity would be achieved – a robust, qualitatively superior natural herd immunity within the population, which would then protect other people from getting the disease in other age groups. It’s the way infectious diseases work…” Barbara explains. “But the vaccinologists have adopted this idea of vaccine induced herd immunity.
The problem with it is that all vaccines only confer temporary protection… Pertussis vaccine is one the best examples… Pertussis vaccines have been used for about 50 to 60 years, and the organism has started to evolve to become vaccine resistant. I think this is not something that’s really understood generally by the public: Vaccines do not confer the same type of immunity that natural exposure to the disease does.”
Vaccine professionals would like you to believe they are the same, but they’re qualitatively two entirely different types of immune responses.
“In most cases natural exposure to disease would give you a longer lasting, more robust, qualitatively superior immunity because it gives you both cell mediated immunity and humoral immunity,” Barbara explains. “Humoral is the antibody production. The way you measure vaccine-induced immunity is by how high the antibody titers are. (How many antibodies you have, basically.)
But the problem is that cell mediated immunity is very important as well. Most vaccines evade cell mediated immunity and go straight for the antibodies, which is only one part of immunity. That’s been the big problem with the production of vaccines.”
Are You Willing to Accept the Risks for a 1.5% Benefit?

The latest study showing the incredibly minimal benefit of the flu vaccine is in line with past research that has also concluded that flu vaccines appear to have very limited measurable benefits for children, adults or seniors.
The Cochrane Database Review—which is the gold standard for assessing the scientific evidence for the effectiveness of commonly used medical interventions — published the following telling statistics:
“Over 200 viruses cause influenza and influenza-like illness, which produce the same symptoms (fever, headache, aches and pains, cough and runny noses). Without laboratory tests, doctors cannot tell the two illnesses apart. Both last for days and rarely lead to death or serious illness. At best, vaccines might be effective against only influenza A and B, which represent about 10 percent of all circulating viruses. Each year, the World Health Organization recommends which viral strains should be included in vaccinations for the forthcoming season.
Authors of this review assessed all trials that compared vaccinated people with unvaccinated people. The combined results of these trials showed that under ideal conditions (vaccine completely matching circulating viral configuration) 33 healthy adults need to be vaccinated to avoid one set of influenza symptoms.
In average conditions (partially matching vaccine) 100 people need to be vaccinated to avoid one set of influenza symptoms.
Vaccine use did not affect the number of people hospitalized or working days lost but caused one case of Guillian-Barré syndrome [GBS] (a major neurological condition leading to paralysis) for every one million vaccinations.”
Is it really worth risking the health and well-being of 100 people in order to prevent ONE case of the flu, which may or may not result in serious illness or death in that one individual to begin with?
While infants and young children are at greatest risk, no one is exempt from the potential serious complications of vaccination, one of which is GBS.
In the video profile of vaccine injury above, Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder and president of NVIC, interviews a Connecticut artist and her mother, a former professor of nursing, who developed Guillaine-Barre syndrome after getting a seasonal flu shot in 2008 and today is permanently disabled with total body paralysis. This family has chosen to share their heartbreaking story to help those who have had the same experience feel less alone, and to educate others about what it means to be vaccine injured.
What happened to this family is a potent reminder of just how important it is to make well-informed decisions about vaccinations.
The Best Way to Prevent the Flu Has Little to do With a Vaccine
Avoiding influenza and flu-like illness during the flu season or any season doesn’t require a flu vaccine. By following the simple guidelines below, you can help keep your immune system in optimal working order so that you’re far less likely to get sick or, if you do get sick, you are better prepared to move through it without complications and soon return to good health.
Optimize your vitamin D levels. As I’ve previously reported, optimizing your vitamin D levels is one of the absolute best strategies for avoiding infections of ALL kinds, and vitamin D deficiency is likely the TRUE culprit behind the seasonality of the flu — not the flu virus itself. This is probably the single most important and least expensive action you can take. Regularly monitor your vitamin D levels to confirm your levels are within the therapeutic range of 50-70 ng/ml.
Ideally, you’ll want to get all your vitamin D from sun exposure or a safe tanning bed, but as a last resort you can take an oral vitamin D3 supplement. According to the latest review by Carole Baggerly (Grassrootshealth.org), adults need about 8,000 IU’s a day.
Avoid Sugar, Fructose and Processed Foods. Sugar impairs the function of your immune system almost immediately, and as you likely know, a healthy immune system is one of the most important keys to fighting off viruses and other illness. Be aware that sugar is present in foods you may not suspect, like ketchup and fruit juice.
Get Enough Rest. Just like it becomes harder for you to get your daily tasks done if you’re tired, if your body is overly fatigued it will be harder for it to fight the flu. Be sure to check out my article Guide to a Good Night’s Sleep for some great tips to help you get quality rest.
Have Effective Tools to Address Stress . We all face some stress every day, but if stress becomes overwhelming then your body will be less able to fight off the flu and other illness. If you feel that stress is taking a toll on your health, consider using an energy psychology tool such as the Emotional Freedom Technique, which is remarkably effective in relieving stress associated with all kinds of events, from work to family to trauma.
Exercise. When you exercise, you increase your circulation and your blood flow throughout your body. The components of your immune system are also better circulated, which means your immune system has a better chance of finding an illness before it spreads.
Take a Good Source of Animal-Based Omega-3 Fats. Increase your intake of healthy and essential fats like the omega-3 found in krill oil, which is crucial for maintaining health. It is also crucial to avoid excessive and/or oxidized omega-6 fatty acids, as well as trans fatty acids commonly found in processed foods, as they will seriously damage your immune response.
Wash Your Hands. Washing your hands will decrease your likelihood of spreading a virus to your nose, mouth or other people. Be sure you don’t use antibacterial soap for this — antibacterial soaps are completely unnecessary, and they cause far more harm than good. Instead, identify a simple chemical-free soap that you can switch your family to.
Use Natural Antibiotics. Examples include colloidal silver, oil of oregano, and garlic. These work like broad-spectrum antibiotics against bacteria, viruses, and protozoa in your body. And unlike pharmaceutical antibiotics, they do not appear to lead to resistance.
Avoid Hospitals. I’d recommend you stay away from hospitals unless you’re having an emergency and need expert medical care, as hospitals are prime breeding grounds for infectious microorganisms of all kinds. The best place to get plenty of rest and recover from illness that is not life-threatening is usually in the comfort of your own home.

Coronavirus Mysteriously has HIV Glycoprotein Inserts not Present in any other known Coronavirus,"       

Coronavirus Mysteriously has HIV Glycoprotein Inserts not Present in any other known Coronavirus – JUST PUBLISHED
by Dr. Robert J. Rowen
Folks, this coronavirus epidemic is getting more interesting and possibly scary. In this just published research, investigators found that that “spikes” exist in this strain not present in any other known coronavirus.
Furthermore, these inserts are the same as certain glycoproteins in the HIV-1 virus.
The authors state this is “unlikely to be fortuitous.”
I am NOT a virologist. I am a clinician, and I humbly but honestly believe that I have far better clinical answers for problems like this than most all of conventional medicine combined.
I want to follow this trail as it suggests something possibly diabolical could have transpired in China.
While our Congress is wasting time, energy, and lots of money in a vain effort by one party to remove the elected president of another party, it seems much better use of such energy could go into understanding what is going on and finding some REAL protection for our people.
Again, I suggest you see the recent video I posted on ozone and coronavirus (see below). I do plan to continue educational YouTube videos on this and related subjects. I humbly ask that you share with others.
The more action I see on these videos and this page, the more justified I will feel in putting out the efforts. Thank you.
Conclusions
Our analysis of the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV revealed several interesting findings: First, we identified 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein that are not present in any other coronavirus reported till date.
To our surprise, all the 4 inserts in the 2019-nCoV mapped to short segments of amino acids in the HIV-1 gp120 and Gag among all annotated virus proteins in the NCBI database.
This uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019- nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag is unlikely to be fortuitous. Further, 3D modelling suggests that at least 3 of the unique inserts which are non-contiguous in the primary protein sequence of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein converge to constitute the key components of the receptor binding site.
Of note, all the 4 inserts have pI values of around 10 that may facilitate virus-host interactions. Taken together, our findings suggest unconventional evolution of 2019-nCoV that warrants further investigation.
Our work highlights novel evolutionary aspects of the 2019-nCoV and has implications on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of this virus.

COVID19 to Usher in First Federal Mandatory Mass Vaccinations?,"       

Coronavirus Pt 2: ‘Never Let a Good Crisis Go to Waste’, Replay
by Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, DO, AOBNMM, ABIHM
Vaxxter
Until recently, the concept of mandatory and mass vaccination has been only a worrisome possibility. Vaccination laws are passed and monitored at the state level, not at the federal level.
But while the country was still struggling to recover from the events of September 11, 2001, and the bioterrorism scares of smallpox and anthrax threats, the groundwork to make vaccines mandatory began to change in 2003, during President George W. Bush’s State of the Union Address.
On that fateful night, Bush revealed the creation of Project BioShield, a comprehensive effort to develop and make available modern, effective drugs and vaccines to protect against attack by biological and chemical weapons.
Project BioShield set forth three major components:
Creation of a permanent ‘indefinite funding authority’ to spur development of ‘medical countermeasures enabling the government to purchase vaccines and other therapies as soon as experts believe that they can be made safe and effective’
Conferred new authority to the NIH to speed research and development of drugs and vaccines that would counter bioterrorism threats and,
Authorized emergency ‘fast track provisions for the release of treatments—drugs and vaccines—still waiting for approval by the FDA ‘in the event of an emergency.’
As sweeping as those plans may seem, the legislation failed to include key provisions sought by the drug companies—complete liability protection for all of its bioterrorism products.
During 2003 and 2004, any bills that were introduced by both the House and the Senate attempting to secure complete liability protection for the industry were done through federal law. In 2005 alone, 13 bills were introduced. One such bill, The Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005 was gaining traction.
Introduced as S. 1873 by Senators Bill Frist (R-TN) and Richard Burr (R-NC), its purpose, according to Burr’s news release, was to “create a partnership between the government and private corporations by rapidly developing effective medical drugs and vaccines to protect the United States from deliberate, accidental, and natural incidents involving biological pathogens.”
Nicknamed BioShield II, the bill planned to give unprecedented advantages to the industry and remove or severely weaken all of the safeguards that prevented dangerous vaccines, drugs, and medical devices from reaching consumers. S. 1873 was accelerated through the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee, without hearings.
Public outrage began almost immediately. Websites, news outlets, and nationwide radio hosts were exposing the unbelievable benefits the bill would convey to the drug companies.
Dozens of activist groups representing many thousands of constituents rallied a campaign to notify Congress of their dissatisfaction with S.1873. Faxes, emails, and phone calls conveyed message after message opposing the carte blanche promises about to be handed to the drug makers. Because the outcry against S.1873 was so strong, the possibility of its passage appeared to be difficult.
To circumvent this outrage, Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist forced the attachment of a shortened version into HR 2863, the 2006 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, literally at the eleventh hour.
Called Division E—Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, Frist’s addendum added 40 pages to an existing 423-page bill on December 17, 2015 at 11:20 pm, well after the House Appropriation Committee members had signed off, and most had gone home. Soon referred to as the PREP Act, it gave sweeping and unprecedented immunity for drug companies for emergency products.
The PREP ACT
The PREP Act provides complete immunity from liability for any loss relating to, or resulting from, any product used to prevent or treat illness during a public health emergency. The immunity applies to entities and individuals involved in the development, manufacturing, testing, distribution, administration, and use of medical countermeasures described in a Declaration.
The only statutory exception to this immunity is for actions or failures to act that constitute ‘willful misconduct.’ And as we will see, even willful misconduct may not be punished. For a full explanation of the scope of the Act, go here.
Representative Dave Obey (D-WI), Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee made the following statement on the floor of the House on December 22, 2005:
“After the [Committee] finished at 6 p.m., Senator Frist (R-TN) marched over to the House side of the Capitol. He insisted 40 pages of legislation that had never been seen by Conferees be attached to the bill.
Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL) joined Frist’s insistence and without a vote of the Conferees, the legislation was unilaterally and arrogantly inserted into the bill. [This was] a blatantly abusive power-play by two of the most powerful men in Congress….”
Rep. Obey’s full rebuttal is no longer available, but you can read it here:  Obey-Speech
Sweeping Provisions Against Americans
Passed in 2005, Senator Frist (a medical doctor) handed the drug companies (a special interest group) more immunity than any bill that has ever been passed by Congress. The legislation provides at least four sweeping provisions:
Immunity from all liability for all drugs, vaccines or biological products deemed as a ‘covered countermeasure’
Immunity from all liability for any product used for any public health emergency declared by the Secretary of HHS.
Immunity from all accountability, no matter what a drug company did wrong. Even if the company’s dirty facility created a batch of contaminated vaccines that resulted in deaths or injuries to thousands of people, the drug company will remain immune from liability.
Immunity from all lawsuits.  A person who suffers any type of loss will be legally prohibited from suing the drug companies; they now have immunity from almost everything, perhaps even murder.
In simple terms, if a claim is filed by a plaintiff it can only go forward if the injured party can prove that the company performed an act of willful misconduct. In other words, the injured party would have to prove the vaccine maker created a product intentionally caused them harm.
Unbelievably, even then the drug company is still immune from accountability. Even if a pharmaceutical company knowingly harms people, the company will be immune from legal prosecution unless the U.S. Attorney General initiates enforcement action against the drug company in the name of the claimant. This means the U.S. government would have to go to bat for the plaintiff against the drug company for the lawsuit to move forward.
Fast forward: COVID19
Wasting no time, the Secretary of HHS, Alex Azar and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response Robert P. Kadlec, MD, MTM&H, MS, issued Notice of Declaration of National Emergency and published in the Federal Register on March 17, 2020 (Vol. 85, No. 52).
The Declaration was effective as of February 4, 2020. By declaring a national emergency for the SARS-CoV-19 virus and COVID-19, the Secretary evoked the PREP Act “to provide liability immunity for activities related to medical countermeasures against COVID–19.”
Once this new, experimental COVID-19 vaccine is deemed to be a ‘covered countermeasure’ there will be no going back. The experimental vaccine designed to protect from a virus that little is known about? Can you think of a worse-case outcome for many? The mainstream media is conditioning people to anticipate and even beg for this vaccine. It’s all part of the Plan.
The Time to Mass Vaccinate Adults Has Arrived
The National Vaccine Plan (NVP) for adults was released in February 2010. It lays out the strategy to vaccinate all adults with all approved vaccines and “any vaccine that is approved, now and in the future.”
The plan established four key goals, each of which is supported by objectives and strategies to guide implementation through 2020:
Goal 1: Strengthen the adult immunization infrastructure
Goal 2: Improve access to adult vaccines
Goal 3: Increase community demand for adult immunizations
Goal 4: Foster innovation in adult vaccine development and vaccination-related technologies
Let’s look at a little closer at what the Plan has to say about Goal #3:
Educate and encourage individuals and healthcare professionals to promote adult vaccination programs
Leverage group influence (faith-based groups, etc.) to promote and demand access to adult vaccinations
Create more robust EHRs to include standing orders, reminder calls, and reminder mailings
Encourage the development of “adult immunization champions” in communities and across all sectors
All forms of media and communication continually remind the general public that a “vaccine for the virus that causes COVID-19 is on the way” and “it’s coming soon.” The implied message is to anticipate it, wait for it and then, as soon as it arrives, go get your vaccine. The listener’s subconscious is being prepared to demand to be vaccinated.
What Can You Do?
I view most current events through the lens of history. As I wrote in Part 1 of this series, we’re seeing a repeat of what happened after 911. Only a few weeks after the towers came down in NYC, the draconian Patriot Act was passed into law on October 26, 2001.
Now, within a few weeks of the outbreak of a coronavirus, a virus we don’t know much about or how long it will cause serious illness, the world has implemented draconian, stay-home “social distancing” rules.
Even this phrase has psychological implications. They didn’t call it “physical distancing” but “social distancing,” a way to separate us at a time we should all be coming together.
How serious is the risk from this pathogen? On the one hand, we hear that 80% of patients experience a mild form of the illness, which can include a fever and pneumonia, and many of these cases require little to no medical intervention.
On the other, we hear that 200,000 to 2 million may die in the US alone. Which is it? Are we really so afraid of this pathogen that we’ve shut down the world? Are we so afraid of contracting this infection that we’re anticipating – even looking forward to – the development of a vaccine that will be deemed a covered countermeasure and have no liability, even if it injures or kills many and protects no one?
Click to enlarge.
Look at this chart closely. This graphic, from 2016, distributes the number of deaths by health risk factors throughout the entire world. It shows what people die from WITHOUT an infection by a rogue virus.
The bottom line is most die from poor nutrition and conditions marked by high inflammation.
Is it any wonder that these people have the highest risk of serious illness IF they become infected?
Perhaps during this forced global shut own one of the most important things you can do is use the time to evaluate all the areas of your life: your physical health, your mental health and your spiritual health and relationship with God. Clean out some closets and finish a few projects you always wished you had time to do.
Read – or write – the book that has been calling you forever. Eat better. Exercise more. Lose some weight. Catch up on your sleep. Play with your kids. Reconnect with your significant other.
Perhaps God has put the entire world into Full Stop so we can meditate and reflect, taking time to course-correct toward what is really most important. Whenever I find myself feeling anxious about the future and the uncertainties of what is going on, I focus on this verse from the Bible: Psalms 46:10 – “Be still and know I am God.”
If you can connect with that idea, you’ll be much more optimistic, and much less anxious, about the future.

Dr. Rowen: Flu Vaccine May Make you more Susceptible to Coronavirus,"       

by Dr. Robert J. Rowen
In case you plan to rush out and get a flu vaccine, you might want to read this abstract, and also share with your pro vaccine friends. It appears that getting a flu vaccine will make you more prone to coronavirus infection. This is hot off the press.
My interpretation of this is that when you receive (or your child) a vaccination, your immune system is artificially deranged by the vaccine so that it will not respond normally to secondary challenge.
This is one of the missing elements in alleged vaccine research. A vaccine “interferes” with the immune system’s normal processes. The first sentence in the abstract says it all:
“…vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as vaccine interference”
Please read. My heart goes out to the millions of children whose immune systems have been tampered with by forced vaccination.
Influenza vaccination and respiratory virus interference among Department of Defense personnel during the 2017-2018 influenza season
Vaccine – Jan. 2020
PURPOSE:
Receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as virus interference. Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. The virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction. This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status. Furthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined.
RESULTS:
We compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results. Comparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients, the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 1.09; p = 0.60). Additionally, the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza were compared to three different control groups: all controls (N = 6120), non-influenza positive controls (N = 2880), and pan-negative controls (N = 3240). The adjusted ORs for the comparisons among the three control groups did not vary much (range: 0.46-0.51).
CONCLUSIONS:
Receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population. Examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results. Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, significant protection with vaccination was associated not only with most influenza viruses, but also parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza virus coinfections.

Philippines and Singapore Testing Coconut Oil as Possible Treatment for Coronavirus,"       
Image source.
Coconut oil eyed as possible treatment for coronavirus infection
by CNN Philippines Staff
Excerpts:
Coconut oil, whose health benefits have been proven in the past, will be tested for use as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus infection.
“That [VCO] is being looked into,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told CNN Philippines’ Newsroom on Tuesday.
“We have heard very good studies with regard to its ability to neutralize the viruses, but for the COVID- 19, it is not clear,” the top health official added.
He made the reaction following Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles’ announcement Monday that a former academician from one of the country’s top universities proposed to test coconut oil as COVID-19 treatment amid the absence of a specific treatment.
In a research proposal published on January 31, Ateneo de Manila University Professor Emeritus Fabian Antonio Dayrit and Dr. Mary Newport of Spring Hill Neonatolody in Florida, United States proposed to conduct a clinical study on patients infected with the COVID-19 involving VCO, saying “this treatment is affordable and virtually risk-free, and the potential benefits are enormous.” Nograles said the National University of Singapore has agreed to test VCO as a prophylactic against the COVID-19.
Current evidence suggests coconut oil and its derivatives are safe and effective antiviral compounds in both humans and animals, the researchers noted.
“Several in vitro, animal, and human studies support the potential of coconut oil, lauric acid and its derivatives as effective and safe agents against a virus like nCoV-2019 [COVID-19],” they said.

The Flu Shot Can Protect You From Coronavirus is FAKE News According to Medical Doctor,"       

How to Prevent Corona Virus? Avoid the Flu Shot
by David Brownstein, M.D.
DrBrownstein.com
I recently posted a third blog post on coronavirus (‘Corona Virus Part III: Say It Ain’t So!’ 2.26.20). I was not planning to write another one so soon but that changed when I saw the report in the New York Times.
The headline in the February 25, 2020 article in the New York Times article reads, “How to prepare for the Coronavirus.” Right below the headline, in large font, it states,
“Wash your hands. Keep a supply of medicines. Get a flu shot.”
I have no problems with the idea of washing hands. That is a good antimicrobial technique.
As for keeping a supply of medications, the author of the article is making the point of having a 30-day supply of medications on hand in case you cannot go out to get them. I have no issue with that advice.
Get a flu shot? WHAT? WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?
The writer states,
“Infectious disease specialists strongly recommend flu vaccination. And the best protection for older people against bacterial pneumonia is, paradoxically, to vaccinate children…”
Folks, this is another example of FAKE NEWS! The flu vaccine has never been shown to protect against pneumonia.
I would suggest the opposite is true; those who get the flu vaccine will be more at risk for other non-flu-like infections such as coronavirus. (1)
This idea that the flu vaccine disrupts the immune system’s ability to fight infections is nothing new. In fact, it was first described in 1960 in relation to the flu vaccine.
I wonder if the flu vaccine was mandated in China before the coronavirus epidemic began. That could explain why so many Chinese were infected with coronavirus.
It is important to keep in mind that the flu vaccine regularly fails most (usually over 90%) who receive it. Not only does it NOT protect you against the flu, it gives the immune system problems identifying other strains of the flu as well as different non-flu like viruses such as…coronavirus.
The take home message to help prevent coronavirus is…wash your hands and avoid the flu vaccine.
To learn more about virus’, vaccines and other health issues from a holistic point of view,  join me on Saturday, March 7th for my annual lecture, ‘Holistic Medicine for the 21st Century’.
To Everyone’s Good Health!

"Dr. Rowen: Ozone REVERSES Critically Ill COVID Patients in China, and VERY RAPIDLY","       
Dr. Robert J. Rowen
by Dr. Robert J. Rowen
Facebook Page
Just Received. Ozone REVERSES Critically Ill COVID Patients in China, and VERY RAPIDLY
If I were given a chance, I strongly believe we could end this nightmare in a few weeks and restore the economy.
My comments are in brackets [ ]
Ozone Autohemotherapy—-A new trial for Novel coronavirus pneumonia
Patient gender: male, 56 years old. He was sent to hospital due to the fever symptom. The nucleic acid testing for the Novel coronavirus was positive, PaO2 74.8mmHg, [Rowen note- this number, 74.8 indicates gravely diseased lungs. The number should be near 100] oxygenation index 80.43, SaO2 95%, Chest CT: ground—glass opacity [really really bad]. The patient was a critical patient.
Specialist consultation team decided to use Ozone Autohemotherapy as follows: ozone concentration 30ug/ml, draw 100ml blood from the patient and mix the blood with the ozone, then transfuse the blood into the body.
The index after 3 hours, PaO2 99.2mmHg [outstanding improvement, only in 3 hours], oxygenation index 132.3, SaO2 98% [this is saturation of blood. 98% is just fine].
The patient felt good, and had a relieved symptom. [Not bad for a critical patient]
After 10 pass of the Ozone Autohemotherapy, PaO2 134mmHg, oxygenation index 462, SaO2 100% (2LPM oxygen flow Nasal Tube in Oxygen Treatment)
Principle:
1. Ozone inactivates virus and bacteria.
2. Improve the body hypoxia
3. Stimulation and regulation of the immune system
All patients with Ozone Autohemotherapy treatment:
1 critical patient, received 10 pass Ozone Autohemotherapy treatment. He felt very good, the index improved and recovered.
1 critical patient, received 2 pass Ozone Autohemotherapy treatment, and improved to normal patient. Fully recovered.
1 normal patient, received 1 pass Ozone Autohemotherapy treatment. Fully recovered.
1 normal patient, received 1 pass Ozone Autohemotherapy treatment. Fully recovered.
The above information was provided by Dr. Shi Kemei from the second hospital of Tianjin medical university, Tianjin, China.
[Rowen note: In my opinion it is beyond malevolent that our system, the disease maintenance system, and the mass media, has totally blacked out the most incredible therapy in the world. Our Rulers are bought out. (My personal opinion.)
To me we are dealing with a pack of ruthless thugs who have hijacked American medicine generating blood money at YOUR risk and expense or your lives and wallets, and now, livelihoods.
Please stuff this information to your local media, the mass media, talk show hosts, and more.
Today I heard Mark Levine, a conservative talk show host beat up on Bernie Sanders for Bernie’s hitting on Pharma.
I detest socialistic policies. But Pharma is evil, and Sanders certainly has a point on this matter. Levine was ignorantly touting the wonders of Pharma coming to our aid and saving countless lives with vaccination and that we should be supporting Pharma and praising the industry.
I could not believe my ears. I can forgive him. He just doesn’t know. But he should know better before mouthing off about vaccination to a public audience.
He has a duty. Perhaps some of you can get to him about this. Perhaps some of you can get to other major talk show or radio hosts. Please try. Your life might hang in the balance.
There is a cure out there for COVID. Fast, simple, Essentially 100% safe. And depending on method used, can be quite cheap. So far, every patient I have heard about who has received ozone therapy for this disease has recovered, including the two critically ill patients here.
This preliminary report exactly mirrors my YouTube Video of a month ago telling you what would happen wen ozone therapy would meet COVID.]

Do We Need $2.5 BILLION for Coronavirus Vaccine? What Happened to the $2 BILLION Spent on the Zika Vaccine?,"       

Coronavirus Part III: Say It Ain’t So!
by David Brownstein, M.D.
DrBrowntein.com
The White House is asking Congress for AT LEAST (oy vey) $2.5 billion in emergency funds, in part, to develop a vaccine for the Coronavirus outbreak. (1)
I have written two recent blog posts about coronavirus which you can find on my homepage (www.drbrownstein.com). Before we give any governmental agency AT LEAST $2.5 billion dollars we should know how it is going to be spent.
Recall the Zika scare from 2016. At that time we were being told by the US governmental agencies (FDA, CDC, and HHS) that somehow a relatively benign virus that has been around for nearly 100 years was suddenly causing birth defects in the form of small-headed babies.
There were headlines in the major papers and fear mongering stories that Zika would do the same in the US. My first article about Zika can be found here: https://www.drbrownstein.com/zika-schmika-how-to-waste-2000000000/.
The title of the article says it all: “Zika Schmika How to Waste $2,000,000,000.” I lamented that President Obama asked Congress for $2 billion dollars to research the “new” problem with Zika. I subsequently wrote three other blog posts stating that Zika would not be a problem in the US and was not the cause of the small-headed babies.
I thought giving the CDC $2 billion dollars was a waste of money. Congress ended up giving the CDC over $1 billion dollars to develop a Zika vaccine.   My fourth Zika post was titled, “Where is our billion dollars?”
Here we are 4 years later and…no Zika vaccine and no more reports of small-headed Zika infections. The reason there are no more reports is because Zika did not cause the problem in the first place. Zika is still occurring around the world and we are still surviving—without an epidemic of small-headed babies.
But, we are $1 billion dollars poorer. And, we still have no Zika vaccine.
So, should we give the US government AT LEAST $2.5 billion to make a vaccine against COVID-19 (the coronavirus strain currently active)?
Right now, the answer should be absolutely not. We simply do not know how deadly this virus is. The information out of China simply cannot be trusted.
The CDC should be the last governmental organization trusted with AT LEAST $2.5 billion dollars to study COVID-19. The CDC has consistently lied and hid data that shows our kids are suffering adverse effects from receiving too many vaccines.
The CDC is the same organization that refuses to complete a study comparing children fully vaccinated against those unvaccinated. That study would provide the final answer to whether too many vaccines are harming our children.  The CDC was tasked with that study decades ago and has the available data available, and yet…we still have no study.
If the Government snares another AT LEAST $2.5 billion from us to study COVID-19, it should be earmarked for treating and quarantining the sick. I say use the money and give the infected COVID-19 patients treatment with antiviral therapies that actually work such as intravenous infusions of hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and vitamin C. That would be a good use of our money. Please don’t use the money for lousy antiviral drugs like Tamiflu.
And, most importantly, keep the CDC away from our pockets.
One last thing, someone (President Trump!) needs to force the CDC to complete a study comparing fully vaccinated children to unvaccinated children.

MIT PhD Scientist: Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates Want Every Person on the Planet Vaccinated,"       
Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai, MIT PhD. Image source.
by Brian Shilhavy
Editor, Health Impact News
In our effort to expose our readership to alternative views on the current COVID19 crisis, we want to feature the work of another scientist who does not follow the narrative being given to the public by our government officials and the corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media.
Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai has a long list of credentials that should allow him to have a voice in the current COVID19 pandemic, but it is highly unlikely you will come across his views outside of the alternative media.
Dr. Shiva is the inventor of email and polymath, and holds four degrees from MIT.
He is a Fulbright Scholar, Lemelson-MIT Awards Finalist, India’s First Outstanding Scientist and Technologist of Indian Origin, Westinghouse Science Talent Honors Award recipient, and a nominee for the U.S. National Medal of Technology and Innovation.
His love of medicine and complex systems began in India when he became intrigued with medicine at the age of five as he observed his grandmother, a farmer and healer in the small village of Muhavur in South India, apply Siddha, India’s oldest system of traditional medicine, to heal and support local villagers.
In 1978, as a 14-year-old, after completing a special program in computer science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Science at NYU, Ayyadurai was recruited by the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ) as a Research Fellow, where he developed the first electronic emulation of the entire interoffice mail system (Inbox, Outbox, Folders, Address Book, Memo, etc.), which he named “EMAIL,” to invent the world’s first email system, resulting in him being awarded the first United States Copyright for Email, Computer Program for Electronic Mail System.
Ayyadurai went on to receive four degrees from MIT, including a bachelors in electrical engineering and computer science, and a dual master’s degree in mechanical engineering and visual studies from the MIT Media Laboratory.
In 2003, he returned to MIT to complete his doctoral work in systems biology within the Department of Biological Engineering, where he developed CytoSolve®, a scalable computational platform for modeling the cell by dynamic integration of molecular pathways models.
Following his doctoral work, he returned to India on a Fulbright, where he discovered the systems theoretic basis of eastern systems of medicine, resulting in Systems Health®, a new educational program that provides a scientific foundation of integrative medicine. While at MIT, he also developed a pioneering new course called Systems Visualization which integrates systems theory, narrative story telling, metaphor and data visualization to provide visualization of complex systems. (Source.)
This past weekend (April, 2020) he was interviewed by the X22 Report. (Note: Health Impact News has no knowledge of this group, and advertisements are embedded into their video.)
Dr. Shiva starts out by explaining the difference between what he calls the “reductionist approach” to medicine and health, and the “systemic approach,” which as an engineer, is the approach he subscribes to.
Rather than focus on a single cause (the coronavirus) to a disease, his approach is to view the body’s “operating system,” which is the immune system. He points out the fact that each one of us carries around over 328 TRILLION viruses in our body, so attributing an illness to a single virus is short-sighted.
Dr. Shiva discusses the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, which has 17 points for developing a “utopia” for the world.
Part of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is the World Health Organization’s IA2030, which is designed to achieve this worldwide “utopia” by seeking to vaccinate every person on the planet.
Dr. Shiva has a long history with the U.S. Government’s top medical doctor controlling the nation’s COVID19 response, Dr. Anthony Fauci.
“This guy is a total front man (for Big Pharma), and no one will call him out. And do you know why? Because all the academics, many of whom I went to school with and studied with, they all have to pay homage to people like Fauci because they control their grant funding.”
Dr. Shiva claims he is an independent researcher who is self-funded, therefore he is able to speak freely.
He mentions the fact that Dr. Fauci is on the leadership council for the Gates Foundation, and that Fauci is best known for developing what he calls the “PR Campaign” to convince the public that the HIV virus caused AIDS. Much research has been conducted that concludes there is no relationship between HIV and AIDS.
Like many other scientists and medical doctors we have featured here at Health Impact News, Dr. Shiva states his concern that the response to the COVID19 pandemic does not match the actual threat to the public. So when the facts do not support the action, we need to look for another cause for the actions.
“This is like the payday for pharma. They have to crash our economy… What’s the result they get? Well, imagine every man, woman, and child, all 7 billion people, extracting about $1000 a year from them, you’re looking at a $7 trillion payback.”
Another purpose of the current actions taken as a result of COVID19, according to Dr. Shiva, is to squash dissent. People cannot congregate and protest if they are confined to their homes, and this started in Wuhan, China, where months earlier there were massive protests due to the horrible pollution in the city.
Dr. Shiva believes there are strong connections between the U.S. CDC and China, and speculates that China is able to take over our economy and squash dissenters as has been done in China.
“What are we heading to becoming? When China has 200 million cameras everywhere. We want to put cameras everywhere. We want people to potentially have fingerprints for whether they got their vaccines or not. This is China 2.0. Are we going to become a colony of China?”

TONS of Vitamin C Arrive in Wuhan China,"       
TONS OF VITAMIN C TO WUHAN
China Using Vitamin C Against COVID
by Andrew W. Saul, Editor-in-Chief
Orthomolecular Medicine News Service
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
We can all agree that 50 tons of vitamin C pretty much qualifies as a megadose. We can also likely agree that trucking 50 tons of vitamin C, straight into Wuhan, full in the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, qualifies as news.
The news media are not reporting this, or any other, significantly positive megavitamin news.

Loving the photo, but needing authentication, I consulted my physician correspondent in China, Richard Cheng, MD. He confirmed it, saying:
“This was reported in the Chinese media about 2 weeks ago.”
Another translator has also independently verified the accuracy of the translation.
DSM, by the way, simply stands for Dutch State Mines, the Netherlands-based parent of DSM Jiangshan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. The Chinese division has been recognized as a “China Enterprise with Outstanding Contribution to Social Responsibility.” https://www.dsm.com/countrysites/locations/jiangshan/en_us/home.html There is another DSM factory in Scotland, which also manufactures vitamin C.
We are so used to being lied to that the truth is like a diamond in a five-and-dime store: you can’t believe it is real because it is mixed in with the fakes. News of nutrition-centered treatment of COVID-19 has been branded “fake news” and “false information.” I say that what is “false” and “fake” is the deliberate omission of any news of health-saving, life-saving measures already underway to help the people of China and the rest of our planet.
Here is more verified but still unreported news of high-dose intravenous vitamin C against COVID-19 in China:
Summary
1) Three repeatedly confirmed vitamin C for COVID-19 research studies are going on in China now. http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n12.shtml
2) Confirmation has also been obtained that 50 tons (yes, tons) of vitamin C has been donated by a major C manufacturer and trucked to Wuhan.
3) The concerned public is receiving only “be-scared-until-we-vaccinate-you” news.
4) Sharing information on COVID-19 vitamin therapy research has now been systematically blocked by Facebook and other social media giants.
5) The news media are not reporting on any of this. Therefore, I ask that you take it upon yourselves to do so and share all this with everyone you can.

Ozone Therapy’s Cost Effective Use in Treating Corona Virus,"       
Dr. Robert J. Rowen
A Plausible “Penny” Costing Effective Treatment for Corona Virus – Ozone Therapy
by ROWENSU CLINIC
Pre-publication Study
Comments by Dr. Rowen
I have just uploaded a paper with high relevance to coronavirus to my office website. Due to formatting, the scientific references were omitted. However, every statement regarding biochemistry is verified in the medical and/or viral/biochemical literature.
Typically, an author would not put out a paper until it is published. However, in this case, lives may be lost if this information is ignored, as, in my opinion, it likely will be. Medical journals are not geared up for information like this as it challenges the stranglehold Pharma has on the industry.
It is a fast and easy read, summarizing my video. I do encourage you to share it. Please forward it to news media, such as Fox, and others. I cannot do it all, and coming from me, it seems to fall on deaf ears. Perhaps they think I have something to gain, other than seeing less pain and suffering by a very promising therapy.
Were this a patentable matter, I would bet that it would be plastered all over the billboards by now.
Thanks for assisting.
Abstract:
Many viruses require reduced sulfhydryl groups for cell fusion and entry. Corona viruses are rich in cysteine, which residues must be intact for viral activity. Sulfhydryl groups are vulnerable to oxidation. Ozone therapy, a very inexpensive and safe modality, may safely exploit this critical vulnerability in many viruses, inclusive of corona virus.
Background:
Corona virus is rapidly exploding in China. There is real threat of a global epidemic with an easily transmissible disease, with a significant morbidity and mortality, now, if not in the future. Regarding this virus, it carries a several days incubation period , infected people will escape simple detection by temperature, permitting rapid global transmission. As of this writing, China has millions on lock down.
Medicine has little in its arsenal for viral disease and its arsenal for bacterial infection is waning as well. This hardy virus may have a soft underbelly easily and safely exploitable with ozone therapy.
Ozone science:
Ozone is triatomic oxygen. Ozone therapy (OT) utilizes 1-5% ozone in 95-99% oxygen as a gas. As a medical therapy, it has been in use since the late 1800s, but is little known. It is not patentable for profit; thus, corporate interests have no incentive. Consequently, few formal studies have been performed. Yet prolific science article have been published, conducted in Italy, Cuba and elsewhere, demonstrating powerful biochemical effects.
Ozone is the most powerful oxidant found in nature. It actually is produced in our body, observed in a stunning discovery at Scripps Institute. Bocci and Menendez both published books summarizing their research groups’ published basic science works. , Briefly, OT improves blood rheology, oxygen delivery, oxygen utilization, and immune modulation via cytokine induction. Bocci privately regarded OT to create “super gifted red cells” and as the “ideal cytokine inducer”.
When blood is treated with ozone, ozone instantly reacts with electron rich bonds and creates longer living downstream metabolites called ozonides: reactive oxygen species and lipid oxidation products, inclusive of peroxides. These molecules appear to act as messengers for the key biochemical and immune modulating effects of the therapy. Menendez found that preconditioning animals with ozone is as powerful as dexamethasone in reducing TNFαin endotoxic shock. This would be exceptionally valuable as a means of safely suppressing “cytokine storm,” often the real killer in hot infections and seemingly with fatal Corona virus.
Viral vulnerability:
In his recent review article, Rowen states:
“OT may be ideal therapy for viruses. In order to successfully penetrate cells, many viruses require membrane glycoproteins in the reduced R-S-H form rather than oxidized (R-S-S-R). Ozone inactivates many viruses directly.
Mirazmi, et.al. found if the thiol groups were oxidized, CMV lost infectivity. When thiols were chemically re-reduced (by dithiothreitol), the virus regained 65% infectivity. Viruses dependent on reduced sulfhydryl include CMV, HIV, Norwalk, collophage MS3, hepatitis A and poliovirus.
Reflecting on the reduction of “critical” disulfide bonds for vaccinia virus cellular entry, Ryser found that protein disulfide isomerase inhibitors limited HIV-1 entry into T cells . Ozone directly inactivates viruses.”
Reduced sulfhydryl appears essential for Ebola virus to enter cells.
Based on the foregoing Rowen surmised that ozone therapy might be the ideal treatment for deadly Ebola. On the invitation of the President of Sierra Leone, we traveled to the country in fall 2014 to bring ozone therapy to the epidemic. Our team managed to get to 5 cases of Ebola, two in physicians, one in the female consort of a physician who died of the disease, and two exposed aides. All survived without any deterioration of symptoms after ozone therapy began, nor did they have any post Ebola complications. The epidemic claimed 60% of its victims and scarred survivors with a 70+% rate of complications. The key method was directly administering oxygen/ozone gas intravenously (DIV), 20 cc at 55 mcg/cc ozone over a few minutes. The material cost is negligible, and leaves virtually no medical waste – only a small 27g butterfly needle.
The treatment requires an ozone generator, medical grade compressed oxygen, and a syringe. The generator can be run off a car battery in remote areas. Ozone therapy is exceptionally safe . Direct intravenous gas administration does carry a risk of temporary chest tightness and cough, and can irritate veins. Compared to a lethal disease, however, it is a negligible price to pay. DIV has been routinely (and safely) used around the world for generations, with significant positive effects on modulating inflammation. Oxygen is a metabolic gas and is rapidly consumed, unlike “air” which is 80% nitrogen. OT is also performed by withdrawing blood into a bottle, adding gas, and reinfusing.
Like Ebola, corona virus structure also has regions rich in cysteine. Alterations of these residues has been found to “cripple” virus growth properties at least 2 logs lower than wild type virus. Active cysteine is essential for membrane fusion. This is consistent with the sulfhydryl research mentioned above.
Cysteine is highly vulnerable to oxidation to disulfide or other residues; which effect will cripple its biochemical activity in proteins. Enzymes may become inactive when reduced sulfhydryl groups are oxidized. Ozone itself will oxidize SH groups instantly on contact. But less reactive ozonides, the product of blood ozone therapy, also accomplish this action (and can persist for days in the blood, providing ongoing protection). This was reported in ozonide attack on cysteine dependent papain, believed to inactivate the enzyme by oxidizing the active sulfhydryl to sulfenate or sulfenic acid.
Comments:
Ozonide drugs are now postulated to possibly remedy the growing resistance of plasmodium to artemisinin, which molecule carries a rare natural oxidizing endoperoxide bridge as its active site. Industry is searching for drugs of this class, while a direct method of creating endogenous ozonides, ozone therapy, has been utilized for a century carrying an excellent background of researched effects and safety, and costs pennies, depending on how and where administered.
Few in our field are not familiar with the great 1918 influenza pandemic. However, few are also aware that inexpensive intravenous hydrogen peroxide was utilized by British physician Oliver in India, who halved the death rate from influenza pneumonia.
Ozone’s challenge is that it does not bring profit to justify private research to advance it towards regulatory agency “approval,” a process requiring tens of millions of USD. Hence, few in the field are aware of it, and fewer will consider “unapproved” therapy even to save lives. Virtually all use is in private offices, where practitioners have no access to an institutional review board, now a requirement to gain acceptance of research for publication. Hence, advancement of the therapy languishes.
Conclusion:
The world already has a most inexpensive, safe, and likely effective remedy for deadly viral diseases, which exploits their redox vulnerability at critical membrane cysteine sites. Ozone therapy could be easily deployed worldwide. This epidemic could provide a means to study ozone therapy very ethically by treating seriously ill patients, who might otherwise expire, with ozone therapy under the auspices of the institution’s review board. Governments should take notice.

CDC Tells Hospitals To List COVID as Cause of Death Even if There are No Test Results Confirming it,"       

CDC Tells Hospitals To List COVID as Cause of Death Even if You’re Just Assuming or It Only Contributed
By C. Douglas Golden
The Western Journal
April 4, 2020
Excerpts:
The problem with making informed decisions about coronavirus is that we don’t have a whole lot of data on it at the moment.
The data that we do have, meanwhile, could end up being terminally skewed, particularly the data that’s been coming out of China.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance on determining COVID-19 as a cause of death isn’t going to help those numbers.
Issued March 24, the guidance tells hospitals to list COVID-19 as a cause of death regardless of whether or not there’s actual testing to confirm that’s the case.
Instead, even if the coronavirus was just a contributing factor or if it’s “assumed to have caused or contributed to death,” it can be listed as the primary cause.
The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, or ICD, has established the code U07.1 for death by coronavirus infection. There’s a secondary code, U07.2, “for clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 where a laboratory confirmation is inconclusive or not available,” according to the CDC guidance.
“Because laboratory test results are not typically reported on death certificates in the U.S., NCHS is not planning to implement U07.2 for mortality statistics.”
Therein lies the problem.
“The underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate. However, the rules for coding and selection of the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID- 19 being the underlying cause more often than not,” the guidelines read.

Media Censoring Medical Doctors Saving Lives with Vitamin C for COVID19 – Reduces Need for Ventilators,"       

Coronavirus XIV: The Good News is Still There But Not Reported By MSM
by David Brownstein, M.D.
DrBrownstein.com
You wouldn’t know it, but there is still good news about COVID-19 out there. Listening to the media would make you believe that the sky is falling and we are all going to die from coronavirus.
Before I get into the good news, let me preface this article by stating that I am not minimizing the dangers of COVID-19. It is a serious illness as I have observed in both patients and friends. Thousands have died and, unfortunately, more deaths are coming.
However, our fear level is much too high for this illness. Children are not dying in droves from this. Nor are children being maimed and paralyzed. This is not Ebola or hemorrhagic fever where the death rate is 50% or higher in those that get it. The final death rate from COVID-19 will probably be at or slightly higher than the regular yearly influenza death rate of 0.01%–once we start testing everybody to see how prevalent this illness actually is.
Original modelling estimates predicted that millions could die in the US. Dr. Fauci stated recently that the worst of the recent modelling estimates may result in 100,000-200,000 deaths. The 100,000-200,000 number is awful.
But, it needs to be put in proper perspective. Let’s say that 200,000 Americans die of COVID-19. That means that COVID-19 will kill o.o6% of our population (200,000/329,500,000). In other words, 99.94% of us will survive. If it kills 100,000, 0.03% of us will die and 99.97% of us will live.
The death of 200,000 Americans is a big deal. But, I don’t think it deserves the fear level we are at right now.
Another important point about these numbers is that COVID-19 primarily kills the elderly and those with co-morbid conditions. Those who do not fall into those categories have a lower risk of death from it.
This should be wakeup call for all Americans to get healthy. We are too heavy, eat poor diets and don’t exercise enough. Adopting a holistic health plan can not only help you feel better, it can lower your risk of dying from many diseases including COVID-19.
For comparison, 630,000 Americans die from heart disease each year.
So, my advice is stop watching the news. They revel in the bad news and censor the good news.
What good news am I talking about?
How about this news: Three US hospitals use of IV vitamin C and other low-cost, readily available drugs cut the death-rate of COVID-19-without the use of ventilators! A press release dated March 30, 2020 stated:
“If you can administer Vitamin C intravenously starting in the Emergency Room and every 6 hours thereafter, while in the hospital, the mortality rate of this disease and the need for mechanical ventilators will likely be greatly reduced,” says Dr. Pierre Kory, the Medical Director of the Trauma and Life Support Center and Chief of the Critical Care Service at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.
He explains that it’s the inﬂammation sparked by the Coronavirus, not the virus itself, that kills patients. Inﬂammation causes a condition called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which damages the lungs so that patients, suffering fever, fatigue, and the sense that their inner chest is on ﬁre, eventually cannot breathe without the help of a ventilator.
The vitamin C is a combination therapy developed in 2017 by Dr. Paul Marik at Eastern Virginia Medical School. He gives critically ill patients IV doses of hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and vitamin B1 within six hours of entering the emergency room. Dr. Marik reported a significantly lowered death rate in those treated with his regimen.
When COVID-19 came to Virginia, Dr. Marik used his protocol. He reported saving four COVID-19 patients including an 86-year-old man admitted to the hospital with 100% oxygen. Elderly people on oxygen usually do not survive COVID-19.
Dr. J. Varon at United General Hospital in Houston reported saving 16 lives with this protocol. He reports that his patients are getting off the ventilator at 48 hours instead of 10-21 days!
My faithful readers know that I have been yelling as loudly as I can that all COVID-19 patients should be getting vitamin C IVs.
In fact, they should be getting vitamin C IVs within six hours of entering the ER because data shows a markedly reduced mortality rate if the IV is started within six hours of admission. A delay above that markedly increases the death rate.
Once 12 hours has passed, it is too late. There is no mortality benefit from the IV protocol.
So why isn’t IV vitamin C along with the other therapies Dr. Marik recommends being used in every COVID-19 patient? I am rarely at a loss for words, but here I am.
It is infuriating. I have shown you our success in treating COVID-19 patients with a holistic protocol that includes oral dosing of vitamins A, C, D, and iodine as well as IV vitamin C, ozone, and hydrogen peroxide.
I passed along the information I presented above to two local hospitals and offered my services to explain how to properly administer IV nutrients. To date, I have heard nothing. Yet, many continue to die as conventional medicine has little to offer COVID-19 patients.
Conventional medicine can wait for a vaccine. At the Center for Holistic Medicine, we know there is not time to wait for a vaccine. Natural therapies work. It is time for you to find a holistic doctor who understands that the best way to treat COVID-19 (and many other illnesses) is to host’s immune system so that it can appropriately fight back and overcome the disease.
Final Thoughts
The press release regarding the success with vitamin C in treating COVID was sent to me late at night Monday (March 30, 2020).   On Tuesday morning, I had a meeting with my nurses and said,
“Finally, the hospitals are going to start using vitamin C on COVID patients. They are going to see what we have been seeing.”
I guess I called that one wrong. I thought the press release would be the lead story on Fox, CNN, MSN, and every other media outlet. I thought there would be run on IV vitamin C. I guess good news is not worth reporting.
I say turn off the news. It is not worth watching. In fact, it is shameful.
Where are the vitamin C reports? What about the reports that hydroxychloroquine appears to be helping?
Folks, there is other good news about COVID that I want to share. I will report that to you tomorrow after I do a little more research.
It is most important to keep in mind that if the worst-case modelling estimate comes true–200,000 die– 99.94% of us will be ok.
And, I don’t believe those estimates at all. More about that later.
To All Our Health,
DrB

NYC Doctor in ER and Critical Care: Lung Injuries Caused by Ventilators – “We’re Treating the Wrong Disease!”,"       
Hospital respiratory ventilation.
by Brian Shilhavy
Editor, Health Impact News
A New York City physician who says he is working as an ER physician in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) treating COVID19 patients, took to YouTube to explain that he believes patients with COVID19 symptoms are being treated incorrectly with mechanical ventilators, and that the ventilators are doing more harm than good.

I am a physician who has been working at the bedside of COVID+ patients in NYC. I believe we are treating the wrong disease and that we must change what we are doing if we want to save as many lives as possible. I welcome any feedback, especially from those bedside: doctors, nurses, xray techs, pharmacists, anyone and everyone. Does this sound wrong or right, is something more right? Please let me know. @cameronks
In the video, he gives a desperate plea to re-think how hospitals are treating COVID19.
In short, I believe we are treating the wrong disease, and I fear that this misguided treatment will lead to a tremendous amount of harm to a great number of people in a very short time… I feel compelled to give this information out.
COVID-19 lung disease, as far as I can see, is not a pneumonia and should not be treated as one.
He then put out a second video:

We don’t know where we’re going. We are putting breathing tubes in people and putting them on ventilators and dialing up the pressure to open their lungs. I’ve talked to doctors all around the country and it is becoming increasingly clear that the pressure we are providing may be hurting their lungs. That it is highly likely that the high pressures we are using are damaging the lungs of the patients we are putting breathing tubes in… we are running the ventilators in the wrong way…. COVID-19 patients need oxygen, they do not need pressure.
25% of Patients Who Receive Treatment on Mechanical Ventilators Suffer Lung Damage
One of the over-riding principles in the current Pharma-driven medical-care model (it is technically wrong to call our medical system “health care” because healthy people do not provide income, only disease management does – see: Investment Report Reveals Medical Cures not Profitable for Big Pharma – Sick People Needed to Sustain Drug Sales) is that casualties due to medical intervention are accepted “for the greater good.”
What is not being reported in the media right now with all the attention on producing mechanical ventilators and distributing them not only to hospitals in the U.S., but also to other countries as President Trump said is their intention, after he forced GM and other corporations to make them, is that injuries caused by these ventilators are common.
They routinely damage lungs, and since it is well known that those suffering from coronaviruses are already sick with compromised immune systems, it is statistically proven that many of these people going to the hospital right now to receive treatment, will have their lungs damaged from these ventilators.
Ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) is a common cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
But don’t take my word for it (I am NOT a doctor!), look it up for yourselves. The documentation in the medical literature is prolific.
Here is a good summary:
Ventilator Associated Lung Injury
by Dr Chris Nickson, last update March 30, 2019
OVERVIEW
Mechanical ventilation with application of pressure to the lung, whether positive or negative, can cause damage known as ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI)
VALI may occur in previously normal lungs or worsen pre-existing ARDS
About 1 in 4 mechanically ventilated patients develop VALI, the risk is likely higher in ARDS patients
Ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) is sometimes used as a synonym for VALI, but strictly speaking VILI is VALI when mechanical ventilation is the proven cause of lung injury
Source.
The medical authorities have told us that without mitigation, 2 million people or more would have died from COVID19 in the U.S., and that people would be falling dead in the streets, on trains, in stores, etc.
But has anyone read of any COVID19 reported deaths like this, or in one’s home?
As far as I can tell from media reports, they are all dying in hospitals, and accidental hospital deaths are over 100,000 per year, and is not even a fact that is disputed.","April 5, 2020",https://healthimpactnews.com/2020/nyc-doctor-in-er-and-critical-care-lung-injuries-caused-by-ventilators-were-treating-the-wrong-disease/
More Vitamin C Studies Approved in China to Fight Coronavirus: Therapy Censored in U.S.,"       

Comments by Brian Shilhavy
Editor, Health Impact News
On January 27, 2020 we published a press release from Orthomolecular Medicine News Service regarding Vitamin C and its use in treating the Coronavirus. See:
Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus
It soon went viral on Facebook, until Facebook labeled it as “Fake News.” Facebook partners with a website called “Lead Stories” to discredit news stories they do not want becoming popular on Facebook. Health Impact News is a popular target of “Lead Stories.”

Since we published this news release in January, however, several hospitals in China have begun to conduct trials on intravenous Vitamin C therapy, so it is hardly “Fake News” as Facebook is claiming.
In fact, Facebook is the one guilty of promoting “Fake News” by erroneously claiming there is no proof that Vitamin C can help combat the Coronavirus, when in fact clinical research trials are well underway in China with ample evidence that should be shared with the public, and not suppressed, simply because U.S. sources in bed with Big Pharma do not want the public to have this information.
Orthomolecular Medicine News Service editor Andrew Saul has just published an updated report, and he notes:
The World Health Organization (WHO) has, literally, met with Google and Facebook and other media giants to stop the spread of what they declare to be wrong information.
Physician-directed, hospital-based administration of intravenous vitamin C has been marginalized or discredited. Scientific debate over COVID-19 appears to not be allowed.
Ironically, Facebook, blocking any significant users’ sharing of the news of approved vitamin therapy research, is itself blocked in China by the Chinese government. As for the internet, yes, China has it. And yes, it is censored. But, significantly, the Chinese government has not blocked this real news on how intravenous vitamin C will save lives in the COVID-19 epidemic.
Hence, the news about Vitamin C therapy helping with the Coronavirus outbreak is found mostly in Chinese language websites, endorsed by the Communist China Government’s controlled media, but mostly banned in the English language social media platforms like Facebook, or censored from Google search results.
Three Intravenous Vitamin C Research Studies Approved for Treating COVID-19
by Andrew W. Saul, Editor
Orthomolecular Medicine News Service
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
(OMNS February 21, 2020) Intravenous vitamin C is already being employed in China against COVID-19 coronavirus.

Direct report from China
OMNS Chinese edition editor Dr. Richard Cheng is reporting from China about the first approved study of 12,000 to 24,000 mg/day of vitamin C by IV. The doctor also specifically calls for immediate use of vitamin C for prevention of coronavirus (COVID-19).

A second clinical trial of intravenous vitamin C was announced in China on Feb. 13th. In this second study, says Dr. Cheng,
“They plan to give 6,000 mg/day and 12,000 mg/day per day for moderate and severe cases. We are also communicating with other hospitals about starting more intravenous vitamin C clinical studies. We would like to see oral vitamin C included in these studies, as the oral forms can be applied to more patients and at home.”
Additional information at http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n11.shtml
And on Feb 21, 2020, announcement has been made of a third research trial now approved for intravenous vitamin C for COVID-19.

Dr. Cheng, who is a US board-certified specialist in anti-aging medicine, adds:
“Vitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2,000 people have died of the COIV-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard large dose intravenous vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.”
He adds that:
“Early and sufficiently large doses of intravenous vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but also involved in virus killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose intravenous vitamin C is not just at antiviral level. It is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that kills most people from coronaviral pandemics (SARS, MERS and now NCP). ARDS is a common final pathway leading to death.
“We therefore call for a worldwide discussion and debate on this topic.”
News of vitamin C research for COVID-19 is being actively suppressed
Anyone saying that vitamin therapy can stop coronavirus is already being labeled as “promoting false information” and promulgating “fake news.” Even the sharing of verifiable news, and direct quotes from credentialed medical professionals, is being restricted or blocked on social media. You can see sequential examples of this phenomenon at my Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/themegavitaminman .
Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) has, literally, met with Google and Facebook and other media giants to stop the spread of what they declare to be wrong information. https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/02/14/facebook-google-amazon-met-with-who-to-talk-coronavirus-misinformation.html?__twitter_impression=true
Physician-directed, hospital-based administration of intravenous vitamin C has been marginalized or discredited. Scientific debate over COVID-19 appears to not be allowed.
Ironically, Facebook, blocking any significant users’ sharing of the news of approved vitamin therapy research, is itself blocked in China by the Chinese government. As for the internet, yes, China has it. And yes, it is censored. But, significantly, the Chinese government has not blocked this real news on how intravenous vitamin C will save lives in the COVID-19 epidemic. Here is the protocol as published in Chinese: http://orthomolecular.org/resources/omns/v16n11-chi.shtml
Medical orthodoxy obsessively focuses on searching for a vaccine and/or drug for coronavirus COVID-19). While they are looking for what would be fabulously profitable approaches, we have with vitamin C an existing, plausible, clinically demonstrated method to treat what coronavirus patients die from: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or pneumonia.
And it is available right now.

COVID19 Vaccine Makers Using Aborted Fetal Cells,"       

Another Pharmaceutical Company – Johnson & Johnson Using Aborted Fetal Cells to Develop Covid-19 Vaccine
by Children of God for Life
For Immediate Release
(Clearwater, FL) For the second time in less than a week, Children of God for Life is calling out the pharmaceutical industry for the use of aborted fetal cell lines in potential Covid-19 vaccines.
On March 25th, the organization exposed Moderna’s use of the aborted fetal cell line HEK 293.
This time it’s Janssen Pharmaceutical, owned by Johnson and Johnson, that is using their PER C6 Ad5 technology, derived from an aborted baby’s retinal tissue. Dr. Alex van der Eb revealed the information on this abortion at FDA hearings in 2001:
“So I isolated retina from a fetus, from a healthy fetus as far as could be seen, of 18 weeks old. There was nothing special with a family history or the pregnancy was completely normal up to the 18 weeks, and it turned out to be a socially indicated abortus – abortus provocatus, and that was simply because the woman wanted to get rid of the fetus… what was written down was unknown father, and that was, in fact, the reason why the abortion was requested.”
Adding insult to injury, Dr. van der Eb went on to admit:
“PER C6 was made just for pharmaceutical manufacturing of adenovirus vectors… And then pharmaceutical industry standard. I realize that this sounds a bit commercial, but PER C6 were made for that particular purpose.”
Not only are there moral problems with using aborted fetal cells, but the PER C6 Ad5 technology also has safety concerns that have been raised with the FDA as well.
“Residual DNA in vaccines derived from tumorigenic cells, including those transformed by Ad5, can pose potential risks to the vaccine recipient in two respects: oncogenicity and infectivity. Each of these biological properties must be considered and evaluated for each cell substrate.”
Vinnedge noted there is not one FDA-approved vaccine in the US using this cell line, though several did take interest when it was announced in 2001. One of those companies was Merck who tried the cell line in a new HIV vaccine but ended the project in 2007 when the vaccine proved to be ineffective.
“This is about as irresponsible as the industry can get”, stated Debi Vinnedge, Executive Director of Children of God for Life. “We have a worldwide pandemic where millions of people are in need of treatment and prevention of disease. Yet Johnson and Johnson is choosing to produce a vaccine that a large number of people of good conscience will refuse due to the aborted fetal cells!”
In their own Code of Business Conduct, Johnson & Johnson states that:
“We believe acting ethically and responsibly is not only the right thing to do, but also the right thing to do for our business. Our Johnson & Johnson Code of Business Conduct ensures that we hold ourselves and how we do business to a high standard, allowing us to fulfill our obligations to the many stakeholders we serve.”
But their use of aborted fetal material in consumer medicines is far from the high ethical standards or concern for their customers and stakeholders whom they are claiming to serve. The irony of what they are doing in using aborted fetal cell lines is not lost to the casual observer.
“How despicable that a company whose success was largely acquired from its’ products for living babies is trying to capitalize on the remains of a deliberately murdered one,” she added.
In light of the fact that the US just signed a $450 million dollar contract with Johnson & Johnson to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, we are asking the public to contact President Trump who has denied federal funding for aborted fetal research.

Who is Controlling the U.S. Response to COVID19: The White House or Bill Gates?,"       

by Brian Shilhavy
Editor, Health Impact News
The headline to this article, “Who is Controlling the U.S. Response to COVID19: The White House or Bill Gates?,” may seem sensational to some, and some might even accuse me of “click bait.”
Often when we write articles that put forward an opinion and there are not enough known facts to support a possible conclusion to a statement or premise, as journalists we make the statement into a question, because the fact is we don’t truly know, although we have suspicions based on the available evidence.
However, my intent in what I write today, is to present enough evidence so that by the time you finish reading this article, and watching a video I will include towards the end, that you will come to the conclusion that Bill Gates is indeed the one who has crafted the U.S. response to the current COVID19 pandemic.
President Trump started his current job as President of the United States in January of 2017. Based on the upcoming elections of November 2020, his job will end either in January of 2021, or January of 2025. His job is a temporary job, lasting either 4 years, or 8 years at the most.
Bill Gates, on the other hand, is not an elected official. As one of the wealthiest persons on the planet, he has influenced public health policy for decades, spanning the administration of several U.S. Presidents.
He is not going to end his job anytime soon, and it is doubtful that there is any entity on earth powerful enough to force him to do so.
Yesterday, April 7, 2020, President Trump announced that the United States may no longer support the World Health Organization (WHO), because he believes that this organization has handled the Coronavirus pandemic wrongly. He stated that the World Health Organization receives more funding from the United States than any other country.
That may be true as far as countries go, but nobody contributes more to the World Health Organization than Bill Gates does, either directly through his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, or through other organizations and enterprises he funds.
Bill Gates is richer and more powerful than almost any country in the world, and he is accountable to nobody.
So what is his ultimate purpose in the COVID19 response that he has crafted, and that has crippled the economy of not only the United States, but virtually every other country of the world as well?
The Cure Cannot Be Worse than the Problem?
While it may seem like an eternity ago, when the White House COVID19 Task Force was setup just a little over 3 weeks ago, the recommendation was for all Americans to “lock down” for 15 days and practice social distancing, among other things.
As we watched with horror, the U.S. economy come to a screeching halt, and President Trump seemed to prepare the American public to go back to work and resume normal activities in the midst of the Coronavirus fear. The statement he kept telling us was:
The cure cannot be worse than the problem.
He seemed to understand that the consequences, including health consequences, of keeping people out of work and socially isolated were far worse than fears of what the Coronavirus could do.
Even his medical advisers seemed to be reassuring us that it was mostly the aged and feeble who were at risk, and not the majority of the population.
But that all changed very quickly, and it was soon announced that these restrictions would continue for another 30 days.
What changed?
Bill Gates Had Other Plans
President Trump with Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Brix at a White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing from the White House.
Two doctors with national prominence have appeared with President Trump at most of the White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings, and it is clear that these two doctors convinced President Trump to keep the country shut down longer than he apparently wanted to.
But what most of the country probably does not know, is that both of these doctors have financial connections to Bill Gates.
Dr. Fauci shaking hands with Bill Gates in 2018 at an NIH workshop. Image Source.
Dr. Anthony Fauci is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), a division of National Institutes of Health (NIH).
In 2019 the NIH announced it was spending $100 million (U.S. Government funds) “to develop gene-based therapies for 2 diseases: HIV and sickle cell disease (SCD).” Dr. Fauci’s NIAID was part of this.
In the same announcement, the Gates Foundation also pledged $100 million in a collaboration with the NIH.
The Gates Foundation and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a part of the NIH, are both currently exploring gene-based treatments for HIV, together with other therapies, and they noted that this collaboration will allow them to intensify their research, coordinate on their efforts, and accelerate studies into early clinical trials to testpromising interventions.
“This collaboration is an ambitious step forward, harnessing the most cutting-edge scientific tools and NIH’s sizable global HIV research infrastructure to one day deliver a cure and end the global HIV pandemic,” said NIAID director Anthony S.Fauci, MD, in a statement announcing the initiative. (Source.)
The drug company Moderna was the first company to receive funding to develop a vaccine for COVID19. It is to be developed under the leadership of Dr. Fauci and the NIAID.
Moderna dispatched vaccine vials to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in Bethesda, Md. The clinic aims to test the vaccine on about 20 to 25 healthy volunteers by late April. The goal of the study will be to see if two doses of the vaccine are safe and produce a response in the immune system to fight off COVID-19 infection.
NIAID Director Dr. Anthony Fauci told the Journal that this is an unprecedented speed at which a potential vaccine for a global disease outbreak could be created. (Source.)
As we have previously reported, this vaccine is going to be an mRNA-based vaccine which has never previously been in the market. It has the potential to alter human DNA. See:
Will a COVID19 Vaccine be the First Vaccine to Alter Human DNA to Further Advance Transhumanism?
The National Plan to Vaccinate Every American – National Registry to Record Everyone’s Vaccination Status
Moderna was already developing a potential mRNA-based vaccine along with Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates for HIV infection. See:
Moderna Wins Initial $20M Grant from Gates Foundation
But thanks to the invoking of the PREP Act (Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act) for the first time in our nation’s history, the COVID19 vaccine is being fast-tracked without the usual testing and safety precautions, and will undoubtedly become the first mRNA-based vaccine to be tested in the U.S. and world population.

Dr. Debra Birx, the other doctor on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, has worked with Dr. Fauci on HIV/AIDS research and vaccine development, and also has financial ties to Bill Gates.
According to Patrick Howley, writing for the National File, Dr. Birx discarded several proposed models for the Coronavirus outbreak and chose a single model funded by Bill Gates, via the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). (Source.)
Howley also reports:
Deborah Birx Sits on the Board of The Global Fund, which is heavily funded by Bill Gates’ organizational network, as journalist Jordan Schactel discovered. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave the Global Fund a $750 million promissory note in 2012.
The Global Fund explains, “The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a key partner of the Global Fund, providing cash contributions, actively participating on its board and committees, and supporting the Global Fund’s advocacy, communications and fundraising efforts. The Gates Foundation has contributed US$2.24 billion to the Global Fund to date, and pledged US$760 million for the Global Fund’s Sixth Replenishment, covering 2020-2022.”
Bill Gates Global Agenda
Source.
Bill Gates global agenda is no secret, and in recent days he has made the media circuits to promote his agenda.
He wants the entire population vaccinated with a new mRNA-based COVID19 vaccine, and he wants the lock downs to continue until this vaccine is developed. Once it is developed, only those who have a COVID19 vaccine certificate will be allowed to travel. See:
Bill Gates Calls for Vaccine Certificates as Requirement for Travel
This is nothing new for Bill Gates. This plan has been in place for many years, and with the current Coronavirus scare and world-wide lock down, he is coming close to seeing his dreams come true of vaccinating every human being on the planet with a vaccine that he funds.
People have been sounding the alarm on Bill Gates’ global agenda for years, and not just those who take a skeptical view of vaccines. Even some among the corporate-sponsored media have raised concerns over the years about Gates’ control of global health and the influence he has over the World Health Organization (WHO).
See this 2017 article by Politico:
Meet the world’s most powerful doctor: Bill Gates
The media has been reporting for years that the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is one of the largest contributors to WHO, second only to the United States, and outspending all other nations of the world.
However, that is just measuring direct contributions. The WHO derives less than 20% of its budget from the governments of nations around the world. The other 80%+ come from mostly private institutions and individuals.
WHO has two primary sources of revenue:
assessed contributions (set amounts expected to be paid by member-state governments, scaled by income and population) and
voluntary contributions (other funds provided by member states, plus contributions from private organizations and individuals).
Source.
The bulk of spending through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is for the development of vaccines. They are behind the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunization (GAVI) organization, which supplements what WHO spends on vaccine development.
As we reported here at Health Impact News back in January, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation teamed up with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and the World Economic Forum last year to present Event 201, which ran simulation exercises on how to plan for a world-wide pandemic due to a coronavirus, six weeks before the outbreak in Wuhan China occurred. See:
Did Bill Gates & World Economic Forum Predict Coronavirus Outbreak? Will There be an Internet Blackout to Control Information?
Almost everything they planned for has now happened with the current COVID19 reactions.
The only thing that has NOT happened, is an Internet blackout to control the flow of information.
The most likely reason this has not happened, is that the public for the most part has complied with their agenda and stayed home. There are no protests or civil unrest, which is something they probably were not anticipating, as there has been almost full compliance to locking down the country and destroying the economy.
And with everyone staying at home there has been a record surge in Internet usage as people are bored with nothing to do and are streaming content like never before. If this were to be cutoff, most likely there would be civil unrest due to Americans’ current addiction to entertainment.
So at least that allows Internet sites like Health Impact News to continue publishing information that is contrary to the controlled narrative coming from the corporate media and White House – for now.
To learn more about Bill Gates’ global agenda, which goes beyond vaccinating everyone on the planet and includes digital currency and controlling the world banking system, this video report from Spiro Skouras is a MUST VIEWING while it is still available.

In a yet-to-be-published follow-up article I will speculate as to the motives behind Bill Gates and his global agenda, but I wanted to keep this article as factual as possible.
There should be little doubt left in anyone’s minds, if they follow the links provided in this article and watch Spiro’s video report above, that Bill Gates and not President Trump is currently calling the shots regarding the U.S. response to the COVID19 situation.
If President Trump truly represents the interests of the American population, he needs to set Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birx apart and allow other voices to become part of the national dialogue who do not support Bill Gates’ agenda.

"Simple, Effective Natural Ways to Maintain a Healthy Respiratory System","       

by Richard Gale and Gary Null PhD
Progressive Radio Network
A hallmark of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 is that it infects the upper respiratory tract accompanied by shortness of breath, a chronic cough and frequently chills, fever and fatigue.
However, these are symptoms similar but not limited to many other viral infections, including other strains of CoV, avian and swine flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), picornaviruses, etc.
The conventional war chest for arming ourselves against respiratory infections are drugs that can lessen the severity of these symptoms and hopefully will kill the virus to prevent it from worsening.  
But pharmaceutical medications are not the only recourse we can rely upon.  There are non-toxic supplements, medicinal botanicals and common sense actions people can adopt to protect themselves.
Consequently, even if infected by COVID-19 or another respiratory virus, our immune system can be strengthened naturally to dramatically reduce the risks of serious complications. 
At the moment, the primary dispensers of information about the pandemic are the White House, the CDC, the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Disease (NIAID) and the World Health Organization (WHO).
The mainstream media and state and local health officials have been completely relying upon comments and reports from these sources to inform or educate the public.
However, what are not being communicated are the clinical experiences and scientific advice from around the world that contain valuable information and analyses to share. In China, Europe, Japan, and the US, there are tens of thousands or more physicians and medical professionals using alternative modalities such as nutritional therapy, naturopathy and Traditional Chinese Medicine to further protect patients from respiratory infections, alongside or to complement conventional drug protocols. 
Unfortunately none of these non-conventional doctors and professionals are being asked for their consultation nor is the large body of scientific literature that supports their regimens being recommended.
We are referring to studies published in respected journals and research conducted by important centers of medical investigation. The question, therefore, is why have a contingent of people on the frontlines of prevention and complementary approaches to health been completely marginalized from the community of so-called “experts” who dominate the voices in the media? 
Therefore we want to share simple natural ways to protect your respiratory system and lungs during this stressful period. None of this information is folk tale but rather it is based on research found in the National Library of Medicine and other professional medical sources. 
Unfortunately, being cooped up indoors for long extended periods of time has its own health risks. It has been shown extensively that indoor air usually has higher concentrations of toxins than outdoor air.
Aside from the psychological effects of isolation, it adversely affects our immune system. People who spend too much time indoors readily become Vitamin D deficient, which is essential for immune protection to avoid contracting infections.
It also disrupts our natural circadian rhythms thereby contributing to poor sleep patterns. 
For the large majority of people, our homes and apartments are ridden with allergens, dust, molds and various fungi and cold-like causing germs.
It is estimated that most Americans have anywhere between 400 to 800 chemicals stored in their bodies and these are often hoarded in fat cells.
Of course, poorly ventilated homes are far more dangerous. Furthermore, many of our everyday household products contain numerous chemical toxins and irritants such as volatile organic compounds (VOC), heavy metals, PBDEs or flame retardants, phthalates and Bisphenol A that are commonly used in all plastics, etc.  
VOCs are found in aerosol products, dry cleaned clothing, paints and varnishes, floor wax, spot removers and air fresheners. All of these chemicals can vaporize easily thereby further polluting indoor air quality.
Sunlight not only increases our level of Vitamin D, which is essential for immune protection, it also raises serotonin levels that can boost our moods.
This finding was confirmed by researchers at the Baker Research Institute in Australia and published in The Lancet. Low serotonin, especially during winter months, has been associated with Seasonal Affective Disorder, which is characterized by depression, fatigue, and a lack of concentration.
And of course, these effects have been shown to adversely affect our immune system. Therefore, making frequent efforts to get outdoors, while maintaining social distancing, not only raises our spirits but also helps clear our respiratory system from allergens and pollutants that accumulate indoors. 
A series of studies conducted by the University of Rochester found that being outdoors increased both physical and mental vitality. Getting a sufficient amount of outdoor exposure is one of the surest natural ways to cleanse our lungs.
Other methods include steam therapy (inhaling water vapor) and exercise to clear airways and drain mucus from the bronchia.
Food, Herbs and Supplements
There are also plenty of foods, herbs and even supplements that can protect the lungs and keep the nasal and respiratory passages clear. Water is absolutely essential for maintaining health lungs since dry lungs result in irritation that increases the risks for infection.
Also following the Mediterranean diet has been shown by epidemiologists at Harvard to have protective effects for allergic respiratory diseases, largely due to the high intake of olive oil.
Potassium is a vital mineral for proper lung function. It is not uncommon for people who are deficient in potassium to experience sporadic breathing problems. Therefore including potassium rich foods in daily meals, such as avocados, dark leafy greens, tomatoes, beets, bananas and oranges, can raise and sustain healthy potassium levels. 
Several studies have shown that apples can improve lung function. A study out of St. George’s Hospital Medical School in London followed over 2,500 individuals between the ages of 45 and 59. Among the various vitamins and foods consumed, Vitamin E and apples were the most effective for slowing the decline in lung function. For people with a history of asthma, apples, which are rich in flavonoids, are inversely linked with asthma, decreased bronchial hypersensitivity, and positively improved general pulmonary health. 
Celery contains two important antioxidants — apigenin and luteolin — that have both been associated with reducing inflammation associated with our nasal passages and lungs. It has been shown to be particularly beneficial for those who have allergies that can hinder respiration. Of course it is important to know whether or not you have a rare allergy to celery itself. 
In an earlier article, we reported on the health benefits of nitric oxide as a signaling molecule to strength our immune system’s response to invasion. One of the best sources for increasing nitric oxide levels in addition to improved endothelial cell function by decreasing oxidative stress are red beets.
Most of our respiratory passageways — from our nasal cavity to our bronchi — are lined with epithelium. Our lungs, on the other hand, are lined with a simple squamous epithelium or “goblet cells.” Beets are one important food that protects these cells to maintain the health of our entire respiratory system.
Beets have also been shown by researchers at Southern Methodist University to help prevent common cold symptoms, especially during periods of increased psychological stress. 
Green Tea and quercetin can promote healthy lungs due to their antioxidant properties. Both act as natural antihistamines that reduce respiratory irritation and inflammation.
A study of 1,000 adults conducted by the medical school at Kyung Hee University in South Korea found that participants who drank two cups of green tea per day had better respiratory function than those who didn’t drink any. Japanese Matcha tea has been investigated and found to be a more powerful antioxidant than regular green teas.
One can conclude that having a daily juice compromised of fresh apples, celery, beets and garlic — which contains the powerful antimicrobial biomolecule allicin that kills human lung pathogenic bacteria — can have an enormous impact on cleansing and protecting our lungs. Matcha tea can be purchased as powders and also added to your daily juice.
It is our opinion that following this guideline along with getting sufficient outdoor exposure, exercise, reducing sources of toxicity in the home and proper ventilation, and drinking green tea and supplementing with quercetin, Vitamins C and D and other foods rich in antioxidants is a very simple and effective way of sustaining maximal lung health to get us through the pandemic. ","April 1, 2020",https://healthimpactnews.com/2020/simple-effective-natural-ways-to-maintain-a-healthy-respiratory-system/
Over $57 Million Paid by U.S. Government for Vaccine Injuries in 2020 as Experimental Coronavirus Vaccine Fast Tracked,"       

by Brian Shilhavy
Editor, Health Impact News
With the nation currently gripped by the Coronavirus crisis, and with most of the public lauding the fact that the FDA is fast-tracking a new vaccine to supposedly fight the Coronavirus, with testing beginning already on humans with the experimental vaccine while bypassing animal testing, unknown to most of the public, a meeting was held on March 6, 2020 with the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines (ACCV), under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
These are quarterly meetings held every 3 months, as required by law, but seldom, if ever, publicized or reported on by the corporate “mainstream” media.
Health Impact News might be the only place where these quarterly meetings are reported, and you can review past reports here. We have been accused of publishing “Fake News” when we publish these reports, but all of the information is available to the public and posted on the Federal Government’s websites.
The Big Tech companies that control so much of the Internet’s traffic, work hard to suppress this information. If you visit one of Health Impact News‘ Facebook Pages, for example, you are likely to see this notice inserted to the top of our page:

Facebook Owner Admits to Congress that They are Censoring Vaccine Safety Information
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is supposed to be the authoritative source for information about vaccines.
However, the CDC has huge conflicts of interest that are not disclosed to the public, as they are largest purchaser of vaccines in the world, using YOUR tax dollars to purchase them and advertise them. See:

Dr. Brownstein on CDC Corruption: “I am Tired of Writing About This – I See Patients Damaged by Vaccines”
It is no surprise that many among the American population currently have a hard time trusting that the CDC is giving us accurate information regarding the Coronavirus situation.

The March 6th meeting by the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines included a report from the Department of Justice (DOJ) on cases settled for vaccine injuries and deaths as mandated by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP).
The NVICP was started as a result of a law passed in 1986 that gave pharmaceutical companies legal immunity from being sued due to injuries and deaths resulting from vaccines.
If you or a family member is injured or dies from vaccines, you must sue the federal government in this special vaccine court. Many cases are litigated for years before a settlement is reached.
The March, 2020 DOJ report states that 288 petitions were filed during the 3-month time period between 11/16/19 – 2/15/20, with 181 cases being adjudicated and 146 cases compensated.
The March, 2020 DOJ report lists 74 of these settlements for vaccine injuries and deaths, and 60 of those were for damages caused by the flu vaccine (see below).

Read the full March, 2020 DOJ report.
The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was originally intended to compensate for vaccine injuries and deaths among children through the childhood vaccine schedule.
But in recent years, most of the settlements have gone to adults, mainly for injuries and deaths due to the flu vaccine.

If you read some of the reports from a few years ago, it can be seen that the primary injury compensated from the flu shot used to be for Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), with symptoms similar to polio.
Guillain-Barré (Ghee-YAN Bah-RAY) syndrome (GBS) is a rare, autoimmune disorder in which a person’s own immune system damages the nerves, causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis. GBS can cause symptoms that last for a few weeks to several years. Most people recover fully, but some have permanent nerve damage. Some people have died of GBS. (Source: CDC)
Today, most of the awards for flu shot injuries are for “Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration” (SIRVA).
SIRVA stands for “Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration.” It can happen when a vaccine is injected into the shoulder too high or too deep and can cause several types of injuries. However, SIRVA can also occur when a vaccine is properly administered as well. This injury can, in turn, lead to intense, prolonged pain, limited range of motion, and shoulder-related injuries such as Adhesive Capsulitis or Frozen Shoulder Syndrome.
SIRVA can be caused by an injury to the musculoskeletal structures of the shoulders (for example tendons, ligaments, bursa) during the injection of a vaccine. Additionally, it can also be caused by the body’s immune system reacting adversely to one or more components of the vaccine.
The seasonal flu shot, among other vaccinations, is the most common cause of SIRVA because the vaccine is given annually to millions of people in the deltoid muscle of the arm. (Source.)
See:

I asked Wayne Rohde, author of the book “The Vaccine Court,” why there has been such an increase in awards for SIRVA and decrease in GBS, and he offered this comment:
The average SIRVA award range is $80,000.00 to $ 110,000.00.
The average GBS award range is $225,000.00 to $ 500,000.00 plus life care annuity depending on the severity. (My estimate.)
The average award for child injuries was around $350,000.00 to $ 1 million depending on injury and severity.  (My estimate.)
With SIRVA becoming the dominant damage award, we are seeing a shift from more costly compensation to very inexpensive awards.
The trend will be continue to lower the average award as more SIRVA cases become the ONLY award plus a few other adult cases of GBS sprinkled in.
Autism Vaccine Injuries Not Allowed: Too Many
One of the main reasons why the Vaccine Compensation Program pays out most awards to adults and not children anymore, is because they do not allow anyone to sue for “autism” related to vaccine injuries.
When the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund was set up in 1988, autism was the most prevalent vaccine injury brought before the vaccine court, mostly from the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine.
It soon became apparent that the trust fund, funded through taxes the public pays on vaccines, would not be sufficient to litigate all the claims for autism as a vaccine injury.
By March 1, 2010, 13,330 cases had been filed in the special vaccine court, with 5,617 representing autism cases. Of those 13,330 cases filed up to March 1, 2010, only 2,409 were compensated. The rest were dismissed, but there were 5,933 cases still pending, and most of those were claims for vaccine-induced autism, mostly due to either the MMR vaccine, or vaccines containing thimerosal (mercury).
So how did the federal government and the vaccine court handle this?
Simple. They took 3 “test cases” that they said represented all of them, and litigated against those claims. Their own appointed judges then ruled in each case that vaccines were not the cause of their autism.
Then they told everyone else that their autism could not have been caused by vaccines, and that they would pay no damages for all those hundreds of thousands of children suffering with autism. This was all part of what is called The Omnibus Autism Proceeding.
So if you have a child today injured by vaccines and suffering with autism, you cannot sue the federal government in vaccine court, as their official position is that “vaccines do not cause autism.”
U.S. Government being Sued for Lack of Vaccine Safety
Purchase here.
When the 1986 National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVIC) was signed into law, it had certain provisions included to make sure vaccines were regularly tested for safety, since the pharmaceutical companies were being given legal immunity due to faulty vaccines.
The federal government Health and Human Services (HHS) department is tasked with this vaccine safety reporting, and a recent lawsuit has revealed that they have failed to conduct such vaccine safety studies since the law was implemented in 1986. See:
HHS Sued for Not Upholding Vaccine Safety Testing Mandated by Law
Since these facts about vaccines are routinely censored by the pharma-financed “mainstream” media and in government hearings, most of the public is largely unaware of the 1986 NVIC, and that pharmaceutical companies cannot be sued, and that one has to sue the U.S. Government in a special vaccine court.

Bill Gates Calls for Vaccine Certificates as Requirement for Travel,"       

by Brian Shilhavy
Editor, Health Impact News
Some in the Alternative Media are beginning to use the term “Plandemic” instead of “Pandemic” as there is clear evidence that the events unfolding today over the Coronavirus scare have been planned for some time, even before the breakout in Wuhan China late last year.
Source.
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard told Bloomberg News recently that unemployment could reach 30%, and admits that the shut down of the U.S. economy is something that has been planned.
Health Impact News reported back in January of 2020 how Event 201, hosted by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, ran a 5-hour simulation on the Coronavirus pandemic, six weeks before the first outbreak in Wuhan China. See:
Did Bill Gates & World Economic Forum Predict Coronavirus Outbreak? Will There be an Internet Blackout to Control Information?
This week, TED Talks released a video of reporter Chris Anderson interviewing Bill Gates about the Coronavirus response, and Bill Gates says:
Eventually what we’ll have to have is certificates of who’s a recovered person and who’s a vaccinated person because you don’t want people moving around the world….(without their certificates).
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, via its funding to the UN through GAVI, is one of the world’s largest funders of vaccine programs in low-income nations. See:

Experimental Coronavirus Vaccine to Skip Animal Testing – Test Directly on Humans,"       

by Dr. Robert J. Rowen
Folks – coronavirus vaccine is making international news. Please read this:
Coronavirus Update: Vaccine Skips Important Animal Testing Phase, Straight To Human Trials
KEY POINTS
• Human trials on the new COVID-19 vaccine began March 16 in the U.S.
• The human trials began even as animal trials are underway
• This unorthodox approach, which might compromise both the safety and efficacy of the new vaccine, is being questioned by biomedical ethicists
It’s a risky gamble that will save thousands of lives if it pans out but might risk the health of its brave volunteers if it doesn’t. The gamble also doesn’t seem to conform to accepted medical ethics……
Standard clinical trials of any new medicine require scientists first test the vaccine on animals (normally mice) to determine its safety and effectiveness. Only after surviving iterative tests in animal models can a candidate medicine then be tested in human trials. This step has been dispensed within the case of mRNA-1273.
Comments by Dr. Rowen:
Now the above should tell the entire story of the EVIL medical paradigm of today. For the sake of vaccination, THEY are skipping accepted medical ethics, and placing human scared volunteers at risk.
At the same time, the system castigates those of us who do therapies (proven safe) outside the mainstream.
And, while they report on the sensationalism of a vaccine, no mainstream outlet will give a safety-proven and likely effective therapy – oxidation – the time of day.
Just today I was told that a seasoned and respected reporter for a major New York paper, who suddenly turned believer in oxidation therapy when a non-healing wound on her foot healed for about 10 USD topical oxidation treatment, was refused her story on ozone therapy for coronavirus by every news outlet.
They called it “fringe” science. Yet look at what Pharma’s “real” science has brought us in the past generation – superbugs resistant to all antibiotics, millions addicted to narcotics, children left immune cripples from corrupt vaccine studies, billions wasted on worthless statin drugs, Vioxx (which murdered tens of thousands), children hooked on mind-altering drugs, addictive antidepressants, and this is just the tip of the iceberg.
Of course the latter are not fringe science. Fringe science in 1491 would have been suggesting that the world was round.
No, I maintain that we have a system of “fraud” science. Even mainstream medical journals, which will not touch ozone reports have admitted that up to 40% of what they publish is outright fraud. Yet they still put it out, and deny a voice to the alternative.
Incidentally, the reporter’s foot doctor praised her decision to go outside the box and lamented that he just would/could not do it.
I’ve always said, follow the money trail. I hope this reporter will do a little deeper digging. Perhaps she will discover that those in control of Pharma are the same who control the mass media. And, as a result, we are literal prisoners in the Brave New World of Pharma with vaccines as the new “soma.”
We are being “pharmed” by Pharma for profit.
And, as an aside, politicians and the media together are flaming irrational fear and creating a situation where the melt down of the economy will likely claim many fold more lives than by simply letting the virus run its course.
Will the American people ever awaken from their stupor and throw off the tyrannical corporate shackles?

Hospitals Separating Newborn Infants from Mothers due to Coronavirus Fears,"       
Image source.
by Allie Parker
Health Impact News
Expecting mothers can experience enormous amounts of worry and anxiety. With the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the world, expecting mothers have even more reasons to be worried when hospitals are separating newborns from their mothers within seconds of birth.
Newborn taken from mother seconds after birth
“I saw her and felt her on my chest for like maybe three to five seconds.”
This is what mother, Veronica Batton, told KSHB in a story by Lindsay Shively, March 24th. 
Veronica Batton emailed her doctor with concerns about a cough. She agreed to be tested for the coronavirus, but the test results were not back by the time she went into labor.
According to KSHB, Batton claimed, it took a full week for the results to come back, four days after she gave birth to her baby girl at St. Luke’s East Hospital in Lee’s Summit, Missouri.  
While waiting for the test results, Veronica had no contact with her newborn daughter other than the 3-5 seconds directly after delivery, the story reports.
Dr. Ginny Boos is the director of infection prevention for St. Luke’s Health System. According to KSHB, in regards to the amount of time it takes for coronavirus test results to come back, Dr. Boos said,
“That is a ‘big problem’ that causes frustration on ‘multiple levels’.”
KSHB reports the turnaround time is getting quicker.
“Just within the past week,” Boos said, “they now have access to a test with a quicker turnaround time.”
Dr. Boos is quoted by KSHB,
“We are very sensitive to new moms and babies. We have to sometimes make tough decisions that as a result of some of the other delays in the system that we don’t have control over.”
Christopher Frizzelle, writing for The Stranger out of Seattle, reports that separating newborns from their mothers if the mother tested positive for COVID-19 is the recommendation of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which is based on CDC recommendations.
But if the mom is a PUI or is COVID-positive, the recommendation from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) is that medical staff should maintain social distancing of at least six feet between the mom and the baby.
In other words, “Not to do skin-to-skin contact. And the mom goes through labor in a mask. Can you imagine going through natural childbirth, breathing, working, in an air mask the whole time? And then we deliver, and we try to keep them separate from each other.”
Can a mother refuse to be separated from their newborn?
Dr. Brian Brimmage, an obstetrician at UNC Rex Hospital in Raleigh, North Carolina, understands the anxiety created for mothers who fear being separated from their baby after delivery.
According to Marla Milling, with Forbes, in a story April 3, 2020, Dr. Brimmage feels,
“The recommendation is wise in order to protect the health of the baby.”
Dr. Brimmage is quoted as saying,
“With any recommendation we give as providers, patients always have the option of refusing the recommendations we give. It isn’t a prison. I can’t force you to do anything you don’t want to do. Some moms will refuse to separate.  In those situations I’ve heard about them rooming in, but keeping mom and baby six feet apart, or setting up a curtain or a drape between the mom and baby. These measures are better than nothing.” (Emphasis added.)
History has proven parents risk losing their children to CPS when they question or go against medical advice
MedicalKidnap.com has been covering horror stories of families who have had their children taken away because they don’t conform to traditional medicine, choose a holistic approach, or question or refuse a doctor’s recommendation.  
In 2014, Terri LaPoint, reporting for MedicalKidnap.com, highlighted the horror story about the Rengo family who had all three of their children taken from them by CPS for having a home birth and not using steroids on their oldest son’s eczema.  
CPS made the claim, which led to the parents being charged with neglect even though a pediatrician saw the home-birthed twins and concluded in her report they were healthy.
LaPoint reported,
“Research shows that infants do not comprehend separation from their mother; they feel abandoned when they aren’t with her. [Emphasis added] 
Has it really come to the point where CPS can justify the emotional trauma to the children simply because parents don’t choose to follow every recommendation of the medical associations?”
In President Obama’s immigration speech, November 2014, he asked, 
“Are we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents’ arms? Or are we a nation that values families, and works to keep them together?”
LaPoint responded:
“Yet it is this very nation whose Child Protection Service agencies have ripped tiny babies from their parents’ arms simply for the crime of disagreeing with a medical decision. If this could happen to a family who has only sought the most natural of care, then whose children are safe from CPS? Should this type of apparent medical tyranny be tolerated?”
The Rengos aren’t the only family to have their children taken by CPS for being “unconventional,” to have spent thousands of dollars in legal fees and to endure months of separation from their children by simply choosing alternative medicine.
In 2015, MedicalKidnap.com found evidence, in the form of voicemail, from a hospital in New York that states security will be called and the newborn will be taken into custody if the parents refuse an antibacterial eye ointment and vitamin injection.
The voicemail, which has since been taken down from YouTube.com, at the owner’s request, due to “pressure,” was received from a staff member at Rochester General Hospital in New York. The voicemail stated,
“Hi _____ this is ______ from Rochester General. Sorry to take so long to get back to you. I have a policy that you inquired about vitamin K and erythromycin… our policy here – and you were inquiring about that. I have them in my hands, which you can pick them up and copy if you wanted to… Our policy says all newborns will receive the mandated eye (ointment) and vitamin K injections.
If anybody declines, or the parents continue to refuse the interventions, then the security is informed that medical custody is necessary… The hospital will take over medical custody.”
And just last year (2019) the Chicago Tribune reported on a federal lawsuit where parents sued doctors, the hospital and the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) for medically kidnapping their newborns when they refused the Vitamin K shot at birth.
Editor Brian Shilhavy covered the story which states,
“The members of the Health Department basically conclude that since it is DCFS policy to mandate the Vitamin K shot, that medical professionals have the authority to take custody of the child and administer the Vitamin K shot over the objections of the parents, even without DCFS involvement. Such ‘custody’ can be as little as only ‘2 minutes,’ the time it takes to give the shot.”
Finally, there is war between doctors and parents regarding vaccines
Medical Kidnap published a story where Dr. James Lyons-Weiler, author and research scientist, is “concerned about doctors and Child Protective Services overruling parents who choose not to vaccinate.”
Dr. Lyons-Weiler is quoted as stated in a video, no longer available on the Facebook page VAXXED, November 28, 2017, as saying,
“In the United States, there is a new rash of what can only be called Medical Kidnap.”
Questions posed by Dr. Lyons-Weiler are, 
Where do parents stand?
What are our rights?
“When the government acts as though they have the authority to take rights away, that’s when people need to stand up. That’s when the people, especially in the United States, have always recognized that we need to stand up.
And I can’t imagine a right that is more sacred to a mom than the bonding moments that occur right after birth.”
So…do mothers really have the option to refuse isolation from their newborn?
If the government and Child Protection Services (CPS) are stepping in, within hours of a child being born, simply because a family declines antibacterial ointment, vitamin shots and vaccines, it is difficult to believe a family has the right to refuse to be isolated away from their newborn baby with the panic and rise of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and not have CPS involvement.
In the U.S., and around the world, babies are already being separated from their mothers with confirmed COVID-19. 
But, even those mothers who are presumed to be infected, otherwise known as PUI , can still be separated from their baby until the transmission-based precautions are discontinued.
Gretchen Vogel with Science posed the question in a recent story,
“Do newborn babies need to be separated from mothers infected with the new coronavirus?”
Vogel reports,
“The scant data available have led to apparently contradictory recommendations: Some health authorities, including in China and the United States, recommend isolation of newborns from their infected mothers; others, including the World Health Organization (WHO), strongly recommend breastfeeding and keeping mothers and babies together, while taking precautions such as the mother wearing a mask.”
According to Vogel,
“More than 200 million pregnant women around the world are potentially at risk of infection with the new virus. Studies are only beginning to shed light on the degree of danger that pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), represents to them and their newborns. The initial data seem cautiously reassuring, but researchers around the world are racing to collect data that should provide more definitive answers.”
But, Manuel Schmid, a neonatal expert at the University Hospital Zurich, tells Science,
“It’s a philosophical question: What do you do when you don’t have data?”
The story reports, Dr. Schmid and his colleagues have “opted for a middle ground, given the known benefits of physical contact and breastfeeding, which boosts a newborn’s immune system.”
“The decision is ultimately in the family’s hands, and it depends on factors including the health of the mother and baby,” the story claims.
Quoting Dr. Schmid,
“We advise parents and talk with them about risks and benefits. It seems most children are not affected [by the new virus], and those who are affected seem to have mild disease.”
We are reminded by Vogel when she reports,
“This dilemma is only one of several that pregnant women face during the pandemic. Many hospitals, in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus to staff or other patients, have reportedly prohibited all visitors, even including a pregnant woman’s partner.”
A “glimmer of good news” is claimed by Vogel, but it’s hard to find any hope, “good news” and ease of mind when everything is,
“Based on the limited data so far.”
The disease the virus causes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), rarely causes severe complications in children, including newborns. This is the “good news.”
Because of this limited data, transmission of the disease is still unclear.  
One recent study published by JAMA, March 26, 2020, found there is a possibility that mothers affected with COVID-19 could pass the antibodies to their unborn baby.
According to the story published by Science,
“The clue came from a specific kind of antibody, called IgM, which is the first type that forms after an infection. Some kinds of antibodies, called IgG, are known to pass from the mother to the fetus through the placenta, protecting babies from bacteria and viruses they might encounter after birth. All seven of the babies tested in the studies had IgG antibodies to the new coronavirus, presumably from their mothers. IgM antibodies, however, are usually too large to cross the placenta. Nevertheless, researchers found IgM antibodies to the new coronavirus in three of the seven babies.
Their presence in the babies’ blood suggests the infants might have been exposed to the virus in utero and developed their own antibodies. However, the authors of an accompanying commentary note that tests for IgM antibodies can frequently give incorrect results. ‘More definitive evidence is needed,’ they say, before pregnant women and their doctors assume that babies can be infected in utero.”
David Baud, an expert on emerging disease and pregnancy at the Lausanne University Hospital, has,
“Shifted from recommending isolation and no breastfeeding to WHO’s more nuanced approach,” according to Vogel.
Baud is quoted as saying,
“We do not separate mothers and babies.”
And
“We really encourage breastfeeding.”
But Baud does recommend mothers wear a mask, wash their hands and breasts before feeding, and take other precautions to avoid the spread of the virus to her baby. And,
“If a mother is too sick to breastfeed, she should be given the chance to pump her milk if she wishes,” he says.
According to Science and medical studies,
“Breastmilk is known to help protect babies against infections in several ways, including by transferring antibodies against infections a mother has fought off, notes Pura Rayco-Solon, a WHO scientist who helped develop the guidelines.”
The story reports,
“No one has reported testing for antibodies against COVID-19 in breastmilk, but one study in 2004 found antibodies to the SARS virus, which is related to SARS-CoV-2, in the breastmilk of a mother who had recovered from a COVID-19–like disease during pregnancy and later gave birth to a healthy, full-term infant. So far, no evidence has been found of the virus itself in breastmilk samples from more than a dozen women infected with COVID-19.”
Data on whether pregnant women have more severe cases of COVID-19, or less, is unclear based on the reporting from Science.  But they also claimed, according to Denise Jamieson, an expert on emerging infectious disease and pregnancy at Emory University, it is too soon to understand the full impact of the disease during pregnancy. 
“I’ve stopped saying the data we have are reassuring,” she says. “We don’t have nearly enough information to draw conclusions.”
An international registry has been launched to help add evidence and collect data on individuals infected with the virus, and who are pregnant.  According to David Baud,
“This worldwide surveillance might give us very precious information that we can collect—and implement—very quickly.”

Coronavirus: Who is Controlling the Information? Are Potential Government Actions More Dangerous than the Actual Virus?,"       
 

Comments by Brian Shilhavy
Editor, Health Impact News
Is the current coronavirus “pandemic” really threatening modern civilization as we know it, or is it being hyped to appear much worse than it really is?
To answer this question, it depends on where you get your information, and how you interpret that information.
Anyone who has lived in the U.S. much for the past 10 years or so has seen a familiar path that the fear surrounding the coronavirus is taking. We saw the same fear being propagated this past summer (2019) over an alleged new “measles outbreak” that was used to justify massive government intervention, targeted primarily against those who were not vaccinated with the alleged fraudulent MMR vaccine.
New York City went so far as to ban unvaccinated children from appearing in public places this past summer.
And yet, no one died from the measles, and other infectious diseases that were NOT labeled as “outbreaks” or “epidemics,” and yet infected a far higher percentages of people, such as whooping cough that DOES cause death, did not get the same media attention. Merck pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of the MMR vaccine, saw sales soar as a result of the publicized “measles outbreak.”
Other diseases that were promoted by fear-based corporate media outlets in recent years include: Ebola, Zika, Bird Flu, Swine Flu, and many others.
And yet, here we are today at the beginning of 2020 with no history of massive casualties in the U.S. due to these “outbreaks.”
Sharyl Attkisson is an Emmy Award winning independent news reporter who just recently recorded a podcast titled: Coronavirus: Who is controlling the information?
Did you know, for example, that the World Health Organization (WHO) partnered with Google, the one single company who controls the bulk of the flow of information around the world, to make sure search results for the coronavirus are controlled to deliver the message they want the public to receive?
Here at Health Impact News, for example, we have had Facebook mark some of our articles as “Fake News” regarding the coronavirus, because we were publishing alternative health solutions, and not pharmaceutical ones.
One of those articles had to do with Vitamin C therapy, published by Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, and shortly after Facebook marked this article as “Fake News,” it was announced publicly that hospitals in China had started clinical trials on Vitamin C therapy to treat the coronavirus, information mainly suppressed by the corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media.

"Overnight, the U.S. Has Become a Medical Police State","       

The Medically Induced Police State
by Donald Jeffries
LewRockwell.com
I have long feared a police state. Not the figurative one we’ve been letting develop for years now. I mean a literal one. Where they can stop you for any reason and ask you for your “papers.” Where they can restrict your movements, and your associations. Where they can confine you to your homes.
[T]his became an unfortunate reality for me and all other Virginians. Mayor Ralph “Blackface” Northam signed an Executive Order that essentially locks my state down. Police can stop any motorist and ask where they are going. If they aren’t going to a doctor or the store, they can be charged with a misdemeanor.
For now. And those essential personnel who are still working have been given papers. Yes, “show me your papers” is finally here in the land of the free.
Over the course of just a few weeks, America and most of the world has been subjected to a power play that rivals anything that George Orwell could have dreamed up. Whole countries locked down. People quarantined who have no illness. People restricted to their houses. “Social distancing” mandating that people stay six feet apart from one another. The closing down of virtually all businesses. No more going to the movies, or restaurants, or casinos, or concerts. Professional sports leagues and even the NCAA’s lucrative March Madness basketball tournament have been cancelled. All schools have been closed indefinitely.
So, surely all these draconian, unprecedented moves indicate that something really dangerous is going on? Instead, the world has basically come to a standstill over a virus strain, which has not even conclusively been proven to exist, that has killed a fraction of what the common flu kills every year, in this country and around the world.
The Coronavirus has been around for decades. Just look at the back of your can of Lysol. It informs you that their product protects you from “Human Coronavirus,” among other things. Many of us strongly suspect that cases of simple Coronavirus have been lumped in with those purporting to be COVID-19, the dastardly strain in question, which all the best and brightest “experts” inform us could spread across the world like wildfire.
The primary source for all the fear porn which has been emanating from our putrid state-run media for weeks, came from United Kingdom epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, who issued a dire warning that 2.2 million could die from COVID-19 in the United States alone. Without quite the attention given his initial predictions by the hysterical media, Ferguson quietly acknowledged last week that his numbers were wrong. Very, very wrong. His weak admission that perhaps 20,000 could die was not very convincing. And a pair of Stanford professors of medicine followed that up by saying the predictions of fatalities “may be too high by orders of magnitude.”
Instead of responding reasonably to these indications that those who initiated the alarmist talk from our journalists and politicians were utterly wrong, our leaders have doubled down on the heavy-handed, unwarranted response. More states like mine have gone into lock down mode. It is akin to Martial Law, without any visible troops in the streets. Given the lack of opposition to this authoritarianism, they haven’t needed any. Without firing a shot, as the saying goes.
Citizen journalists have posted a myriad of videos on You Tube, which depict not the “overwhelmed” hospitals that are literally bursting at the seams with corpses, but instead largely empty facilities. Jason Goodman has been filming around hospitals in New York City, the alleged epicenter of the alleged epidemic, and it has to be seen to be believed. Idle ambulances everywhere. Disinterested EMT workers and hospital employees. Many, if not most of them not wearing masks. Police harassing him from filming on a public street. I have a friend who lives in New York City, and he just called me this morning to report how non-busy the biggest hospital in Brooklyn looked. Something very strange is going on here.
(Editor’s note: Newsweek just published this: NYC Hospital Chief Calls U.S. Navy Ship’s Coronavirus Relief Efforts ‘a Joke’ as Hundreds of Beds Lay Empty Amid Crisis.)
Meanwhile, Dr. Colleen Smith, a doctor who specializes in “medical simulation,” whatever that is, violated every HIPAA regulation imaginable when she filmed inside an ICU at New York City’s Elmhurst Hospital. Dr. Smith complained about a lack of equipment and resources, the same establishment mantra we’ve heard time and time again from establishment sources, which is invariably blamed on hapless Donald Trump. Her video was published by the New York Times. The same day she was filming inside, Elmhurst Hospital was videotaped outside by a citizen journalist. You guessed it- it resembled a ghost town.
As I’ve made clear to so many who are parroting the mainstream line, “people are dying!,” yes, people are dying. They do everyday. As Bob Dylan, also back in the news this week with a better late than never song about JFK assassination truth, once said, “he not busy being born is busy dying.” The question is, what are the people whose deaths the state-controlled media is fixated upon dying from? How many of these deaths are actually from underlying causes like diabetes or pneumonia, or less frightening strains of virus, like the regular flu or the generic Coronavirus?
There are many disquieting indications that the wild overreaction to this is a hoax, even if the virus is not. The photograph of ominous rows of coffins supposedly emanating out of Italy, which has been allegedly hit so hard by COVID-19, which was proven to be from another country, taken years earlier. The Italian reports indicating that 99% of the fatalities attributed to this virus came from “other pathologies.” The story in early February out of China, that the Chinese were including deaths from pneumonia along with the scary COVID-19 cases. It is no exaggeration to say that, considering the draconian response, those in charge have a tremendous vested interest in significantly increasing the numbers.
Both the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control were caught lying about the same thing in 2009; they falsely inflated the Swine Flu figures. Sharyl Attkisson lost her job with CBS for exposing the CDC. No investigative journalism is allowed in this country, outside of amateurs on the internet. The CDC and WHO are front and center here, along with our perpetually dishonest politicians and laughable, lapdog establishment press. They are the ones selling this narrative. Why would any intelligent person believe them?
I have been lied to my entire life by the most powerful authority figures. I worked for the Medical Industrial Complex for 44 years, until being fired two years ago for helping a handicapped co-worker. You read that right. That’s the chance you take in a “right to work” state. It gives them a right to fire you for no reason. Our healthcare system is hopelessly inefficient and just as corrupt as any other part of America 2.0. The medical profession itself is the third leading cause of death in this country. When you enter a hospital, you take your life in your hands. So excuse me for not trusting in all the white coats issuing their dire pronouncements.
In Virginia, our unofficial Martial Law is in effect until June 10. Just imagine how many businesses will never reopen after being closed for nearly three months. How many employees will be laid off, and be left to deal with the ever-increasing cost of living with their $1200 checks that constituted the trickle-down droppings from the $5.5 trillion dollar “stimulus” package, which Ron Paul called “a massive transfer of wealth from the middle class to the elite?” Picture the massive unemployment claims, somehow paid for by payroll taxes which are not going to be collected from all those unemployed workers who are no longer paying them.
And we still haven’t heard a peep of protest from anyone with a large public platform. Not a single corporate leader whose dedication to capitalism compels him to protest the literal shutdown of almost all commerce. There is a stunning uniformity of opinion on this massive overhaul of our society, which happened in the blink of an eye. Only naysayers like me, with the voices we have on the internet, are pointing out how shockingly wrong all of this is.
America, even as it existed in its watered-down, often embarrassing form a month ago, is forever gone. Once our leaders have demonstrated they can institute such authoritarian restrictions on the populace, with virtually no resistance, it is a certainty they will do it again. Expect to see the kind of ridiculous color-coded “terror threat” warnings we saw after 9/11. When the unquestioned authorities declare that we are at “code red” in terms of a new viral threat, America will just go back into lock down mode. Americans will be used to it.
Helping to sell this narrative has been an astonishing number of celebrities. This virus evidently is predisposed to attack famous people who have shown unswerving devotion to the Deep State. It was entirely predictable that the likes of Tom Hanks, Greta Thunberg, Prince Charles, and Chris Cuomo would test positive. For the Coronavirus, as it is worded in all the celebrity cases, not for COVID-19. This could be the lazy, unintentional intermingling of a generic term for the deadly strain that has stopped the world. Or it could be an admission that technically they are telling the truth- the tests can only determine whether one has Coronavirus, not any particular strain of it.
But there is a huge difference between the two terms; testing positive for the generic Coronavirus is no big deal. It could just be a common cold, or an indication someone is a carrier, with no symptoms at all. If everyone in past years had been frightened by fear porn into getting tested for any sniffle, who knows how many might have been positive? They have somehow convinced most of the public that this virus strain is potentially far more deadly than anything since the Bubonic Plague, despite numbers that remain a fraction of what we see every flu season. With even the most severe flu seasons, nothing has ever been closed or cancelled. Certainly there was never any kind of lock down.
This has all been sold to the public on the basis of protecting us. After all, our leaders care about us. They have only our best interests at heart. And what is more terrifying to anyone than the state of their health? None of us want to put our loved ones’ lives in danger. And so we become even more compliant than normal.
Benjamin Franklin wisely warned, “Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.” Considering the continuous fear porn coming from our leaders, few of us probably feel safe. And their totalitarian response to an invisible enemy should make all of us feel demonstrably less free.

Mises Institute: End the Shutdown,"       

by The Editors of the Mises Institute
The shutdown of the American economy by government decree should end. The lasting and far-reaching harms caused by this authoritarian precedent far outweigh those caused by the COVID-19 virus. The American people—individuals, families, businesses—must decide for themselves how and when to reopen society and return to their daily lives.
Neither the Trump administration nor Congress has the legal authority to shut down American life absent at least baseline due process. As Judge Andrew Napolitano recently wrote, business closures, restrictions on assembly and movement, and quarantines are not constitutionally permissible under some magic “emergency” doctrine. At a minimum, the federal government must show potential imminent harm by specific infected individuals at some form of hearing or trial.
These due process requirements are not suspended.
State and local officials may claim, or even possess, lawful police powers to shut down their communities. We offer no analysis of such powers or claims under the myriad of state constitutions and authorizing legislation. But they should resist exercising these powers. The governor of Virginia, in particular, deserves admonition for unilaterally imposing a lengthy period of virtual house arrest.
We do not know, and cannot yet know, how many Americans will become sick or die from the virus. We do know that predictions regarding infection and death rates are highly unreliable. Even actual deaths attributable to COVID-19 are not so easy to count, as Italy has discovered. Age, general health, and comorbidity are difficult variables to assess, and people may die “with” the virus but not “from” it. It is also very difficult to assess the lethality of the virus relative to previously known types of flu and colds.
To date, COVID-19 deaths in the US are far fewer than deaths in ordinary flu seasons or from past pandemics such as the H1N1 virus. This understanding is critically important to put the virus, and the government response to it, in perspective. Even during past pandemics, depressions, and world wars, Americans went to work.
In 1850, French economist Frédéric Bastiat helped the world understand the “seen and unseen costs” of state policies. It is simple to see how quarantines and lockdowns will slow the spread of COVID-19. It is critical, but not so simple, to see the costs and harms caused by the economic shutdown.
Only then can we rationally understand the tradeoffs involved.
How many Americans suffering from other illnesses cannot see a doctor now? How many Americans will lose their jobs, their life savings, their retirement prospects, and their incalculable feeling of self-worth? How many will succumb to depression, drug or alcohol abuse, and suicide? How many will lose their homes, divorce their spouses, or suffer abuse? How many will never recover in their careers? How many small businesses, including the vital ones of doctors, dentists, and veterinarians, will vanish from your community? How many young people will “fail to launch”?
Worse still, will grocery stores and gas stations remain open and stocked? Will crime spike? Will the American social fabric, already thin from politics, tear apart?
These questions are not rhetorical. All of these things happened, to a degree, following the Great Recession of 2008. They will happen again—very soon—if we fail to act immediately. Tomorrow, on April 1, millions of Americans will not pay rent or mortgages. Millions of small businesses will shutter, just as many large employers such as Macy’s, Kohl’s, airlines, and hotels already have. Millions of service workers are unemployed already, but many more jobs will be lost. The effects will cascade.
There is no conflict between humanitarian and economic concerns; in fact they are flipsides of the same coin. A poorer America will be a much less healthy America, one more vulnerable to future illness and disease. Technology, modern medicine, and market actors can address a virus; already we see entrepreneurs producing cheaper ventilators and doctors using cheap generic drugs with very promising results.
This local, bottom-up approach is the only effective way to confront the virus. The federal government, as we see now and have in the past, is comically incapable of competence in times of crisis.
On a fundamental level, freedom really is more important than security—or, in this case, an illusion of security. We all demonstrate this in our personal lives every day, from flying to driving to riding bicycles, to consuming unhealthy food and drink simply because we like it. Security has never been the sole or even primary goal for a country born in rebellion.
Government cannot decide what aspects of our lives are essential or nonessential. The American people cannot simply sit at home and wait for government checks written on funds that government does not have.
End the shutdown.

Alliance for Natural Health Special Report: COVID19 – Fearmongering Born out of Uncertainty,"       

ANH-Intl Special Report: COVID-19 – fearmongering born out of uncertainty
By Rob Verkerk PhD, founder, executive and scientific director
Alliance for Natural Health International
Coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2, that causes COVID-19 or just plain old ‘coronavirus’ – call it what you like – has taken the world by storm. Humans in every corner of the globe are coming together to ostensibly minimise human tragedy, suffering and hardship linked to the severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the new circulating virus. Unwittingly, some of these efforts might actually cause harms they’re intending to prevent. Governments, corporations, transportation companies, schools, the entertainment and sporting sectors – mostly everyone – have accepted that in the absence of a silver, pharmaceutical bullet against this novel viral infective agent, we must accept the cost of the economic impacts caused by our efforts in trying to contain and control transmission.
One positive outcome of the outbreak is the sense of cooperation that has been enabled. Citizens, regardless of  geographic borders or background, can contribute, in the words of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO),
“to protect themselves, to protect others, whether in the home, the community, the healthcare system, the workplace or the transport system.”
But have health authorities, governments and corporations got enough information and context to be making the decisions they are making, often on our behalf? What are we not being told that we should be told?
Many healthcare professionals working in the natural health or integrative medicine sectors with whom we’ve spoken over the last month or so, like us, feel that context has been sorely missing in the public dialogue on the coronavirus outbreak. As has been comprehensive and relevant advice, especially for older people who are more susceptible, on supporting the immune system (see our separate piece on natural immune support) in the event of infection.
In this special report, released the day after the WHO upgraded the outbreak’s status from epidemic to pandemic, I have attempted to highlight some of the anomalies and problems around the publicly available information, and, just as importantly, identify where key data gaps lie. We hope you’ll find it provides some additional and helpful context to the information that’s being delivered by the mainstream media.
WHO declares pandemic status of COVID-19
Before we kick off proper, if you want to gen up on some basics, albeit from a largely scientific perspective, the following links give you something of a starting point:
Comparison of COVID-19 and flu by Johns Hopkins
Key features of COVID-19 outbreak
Epidemiology and pathogenesis of the COVID-19 outbreak
Our World in Data – looking at the numbers behind the outbreak
If you already need some light relief, here’s a couple of tidbits of trivia:
Coronaviruses get their name from the Latin word ‘corona’, which means ‘crown’ or ‘halo’. When you look at them through a 2D transmission electron microscope you see what looks something like a crown comprised of the club-shaped spikes that cover the surface around the virus particles
Did you know that around 20% of all instances of the common cold are caused by coronaviruses? Unsurprising therefore that most of the symptoms of COVID-19 are something like a common cold
There’s nothing new about this family of viruses that have co-existed with animals and humans for millennia. This one is called novel because it’s the first time it’s been found in humans. No one can be sure about the origins of the virus, but among the more supported theories is that it jumped from bats to pangolins to humans, where it turned up in the wet market of Wuhan in the Hubei province of China. While the origins remain unclear, there are of course fertile grounds for conspiracy theories. Among them was a view expressed by former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who sent a letter to the United Nations stating the virus was “a new weapon for establishing and/or maintaining [the] political and economic upper hand in the global arena.”
Microscopic illustration of the spreading 2019 corona virus that was discovered in Wuhan, China. The image is an artisic but scientific interpretation, with all relevant surface details of this particular virus in place, including Spike Glycoproteins, Hemagglutinin-esterase, E- and M-Proteins and Envelope.
WHO said?
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus at the WHO referred to a “sombre moment” as the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 passed 100,000 in 100 countries over the weekend.
As of yesterday, based on data from Johns Hopkins’ COVID-19 tracker, 87% of cases so far have occurred in just 4 countries (China, Italy, Iran and Korea; see Category 1 countries/areas).
According to the WHO, of the 80,000 reported cases in China, 70% have already fully recovered.

Context by comparison with other infectious diseases
One way of getting context on COVID-19 is to compare the rate of contagiousness (the average basic reproduction number (R0) which is the number of people one person will likely infect) with the case fatality rate (CFR), against other important infectious diseases. This way of looking at the infection makes sense because the COVID-19 outbreak is so recent, while other infectious agents like seasonal flu (caused mostly by influenza A/H1N1 viruses) or ‘swine flu’ (A/H1N1pdm09) have been circulating considerably longer.
One such comparison has been carried out through an interactive graphic called the MicrobeScope (see below) on the Information is Beautiful website. You’ll see data for COVID-19 sitting in the bottom left corner, with moderate contagiousness and relatively low fatality rate (presently around 1-2% of those infected). It’s somewhat higher in Italy (5%), probably because many of those infected have been elderly with comorbidities (heart disease, diabetes, cancer, etc.) so are therefore more susceptible.
You’ll also see, so far, SARS-CoV-2 appears very much less contagious than the mosquito vectored diseases, malaria or dengue fever. It is also much less deadly than tuberculosis, Ebola, meningitis or bird flu, while being slightly more deadly – based on just the first 10 weeks of available data – than seasonal flu.
Link to interactive version of MicrobeScope.

We also need to keep the numbers infected so far in context with those affected by other infectious diseases. Following is a comparison of COVID-19 with 4 other infectious diseases, bearing in mind COVID-19 has reportedly only been circulating for a little over two months:
*COVID-19 cases only from 31 December 2019 to 10 March 2020.
Other coronaviruses that caused huge public disturbances, albeit in more geographically limited areas, namely China and the Middle East, were the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) epidemics of 2002 and 2012, respectively.  SARS caused just over 8,000 deaths and had a fatality rate of nearly 10% as against MERS with around 2,500 causes and 834 deaths, amounting to 34% fatality rate. These figures demonstrate just how many more people are being affected by COVID-19, but relatively, how much less harmful it appears to be too. That’s not something the mainstream media often reports in its bid to fearmonger.
Another good way of estimating infection potential is to look at the doubling rate.
Here, for ease, I suggest you look at data collated from official WHO figures by Australian investment guru, Damien Klassen on the website Nucleuswealth. It makes sense if you’re wanting people to invest that you know how a virus like COVID-19 can change market values. Looked at this way, things don’t presently look optimistic in South Korea, Italy and Iran.
Health threat
The trouble is, these bald numbers tell us only a part of the picture. They can also be misleading. When trying to size up the nature of the threat caused by the infectious agents and what priorities you should give to containment and mitigation, you really need solid answers to a lot of questions. These include knowing the age, gender and location of those who’ve died, how many people are infected (including those with and without symptoms), how long it took them to die after infection, did the infection really cause the death or was it just associated with it, what was the lag time between infection and death, what is the reproductive rate of the agent and does this change with time, what was the person’s health status at the time of infection regardless of outcomes, what was the nature and severity of any symptoms….I could go on.
There is data on only some of these parameters. Even less of it is in the public domain.
When you look at the daily stats of escalating infection rates, they tell you nothing about whether lots of these people are recovering from mild symptoms of disease, or were they dying slow, painful deaths in an ICU? Or were they at home or in remote rural areas where they couldn’t gain access to medical care?
What degree of trust can you put in official data being supplied to the WHO? Again, as Damien Klassen suggests, some data can be trusted less than others.
And just how many people out there would be positive if sampled and tested, but they haven’t been tested because they have no symptoms?  Take the case of the cruise ship, the Diamond Princess that was docked in Yokohama, Japan. A whopping 52% of the 621 confirmed cases onboard (322) were found to be asymptomatic – according to Japan’s Ministry of Health.
Also, are the laboratory tests being used rock solid, meaning do all positive tests mean the virus is present, and vice versa? Back to the Diamond Princess, why did one women test negative during the two weeks of testing while under quarantine on the boat, only to then be found positive when she returned home in Japan? A similar discovery was subsequently made in the cases of two Australian men.
As you delve into what little is known, and note the mass of information that isn’t, an interesting story emerges, one that is at odds with the more definitive viewpoints underpinning public health policy that are being blasted at us daily across the airwaves.
The likely high (unknown) numbers of unreported cases of infection in part explains why Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in his co-written editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine published on 28 February 2020 that “the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%”.
Remember the bird flu pandemic of 2007 caused by the H5N1 virus – or should we say, the human immune reaction to it? At its most virulent, the risk of transmission remained low, relative to many other infectious diseases. The WHO data estimates that the H5N1 avian influenza has killed 53% of those infected between 2003 and 2020, the majority of cases being in just 3 countries, namely Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam.
However, re-analysis of available data shows that the rate might be closer to 14-33%. This change in fatality rate was linked by the study authors to 3 things: 1) many asymptomatic and mild cases might go unreported, 2) there is common under-reporting by some countries for political reasons, and 3) the virulence, in common with many viral infections, declines over time. All of these concerns apply to COVID-19.
A Chinese study published in The Lancet compared those infected by the novel avian influenza (A/H7N9) which broke out in China in 2013 and the more lethal H5N1 avian influenza virus. It looked at the location and age of infected individuals, among other things. It revealed that the median age of those infected was 62 years for H7N9 and just 26 years for H5N1. In both cases, most of those infected (71-75%) were exposed to poultry.
In Italy, which has seen the highest rate of infection outside of China, the average age of death reported by the country’s national health institute was reported as 81, the majority with underlying health problems and 72% being men.
The WHO continues to uphold the 2% case fatality rate. Prof Neil Ferguson and his team at Imperial College London estimate the case fatality rate (CFR) at half this value, 1% which is close to another assessment by a group of New Zealand experts of a CFR of 1.4% for COVID-19 cases outside China.
But there are problems with all of these estimates. Most of the data we see in peer reviewed papers, being issued by governments and health authorities and in the media are based on confirmed cases provided by national governments to the WHO. This involves cases where there has at least been the matching of viral material taken from nose and throat swabsusing real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Being at the early stage of the outbreak, there are limited data on what is happening at a given period in time. For example, if it takes a susceptible person 4 weeks to die following infection, your case-fatality data will be out of step with your infectivity data, being one month behind. The problem is exacerbated further if you have a relatively long incubation time. While varying views on incubation have been put forward, a study just published by Johns Hopkins suggests around a 5-day incubation, which is somewhat shorter than many had previously believed. However, the study also shows that 97.5% of those infected will show symptoms after 11.5 days, while around 1 in 100 will still likely develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine. Given the infection capacity of COVID-19 and these figures, it’s not hard to see how easily the virus can spread exponentially.

Economic threat
Herein lies the double-edge sword delivered to us by COVID-19. The more humans enact containment and social isolation policies in an effort to slow down the contagion of the virus, the less at risk are the most vulnerable members of our society. But also, the greater is the economic impact. The sheer scale of infection makes it a problem.
SARS had a significantly higher case fatality rate, but much lower rates of infection. It killed only 813 people in total but caused a 2% fall in GDP in China where all but two cases occurred.
The scale of the threat is matched by the size of pledges. The “international community” has asked for US$675 million to help protect states with weaker health systems as part of the WHO Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan.
The Gates Foundation have launched funding to identify COVID-19 treatments in conjunction with Wellcome and Mastercard,  with US$125 million being made available.
The UN has released US$15 million from the Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) to help fund global efforts to contain the COVID-19 virus.
But all this pales into insignificance when you look at the potential impacts on certain industries and economies. One sector that will be hit particularly hard by shutdowns and social isolation policies is the airline industry. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) suggests that as much as US$113 billion might be lost by the airline industry in 2020 alone. While it might be better for the environment, it’s not good for those who benefit from the services provided by the airline industry in linking up the world’s economies.
Back in 2003, SARS cost the world US$40 billion in 6 months. How much more will COVID-19 cost?
Pharma solutions in the pipeline?
No drugs have been proven effective against the virus.
A vaccine is being developed, but Dr. Anthony Fauci (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) said it will likely take 12 months before a vaccine is ready for the public, having clashed with US President Donald Trump who said he wanted the vaccine ready in just 2 months.
Gilead Science’s remdesivir is an antiviral drug originally developed against Ebola, which has found use against infections by Marburg and other RNA-stranded viruses. It is currently being trialled in China. It was administered to a US patient on “compassionate grounds” and the patient, whose condition was worsening prior to the drug being given, recovered quickly.
There is a significant risk that mutations by SARS-CoV-2 could lead to resistance to antiviral agents if they were to be used at scale, as occurred with neuraminidase inhibitors like oseltamivir (Tamiflu®) used against seasonal A(H1N1) viral infections.

Do’s and Don’ts
IMPORTANT NOTICE
The information below is for informational and educational purposes only, and should not be construed as medical advice. If you are experiencing any symptoms of illness, or consider that you might have been exposed to the coronavirus, follow the advice of your health authority [the UK’s NHS advice is fairly detailed and useful wherever you may live]. This will typically mean staying at home and avoiding close contact with other people. Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital and, in the UK, use the NHS 111 coronavirus service to get advice on what to do.
As SARS-CoV-2 is another coronavirus, similar to the type that causes 20% of cases of common cold, the same basic hygiene and sanitation requirements apply and, apart from making sure your immune system is in peak condition to deal with any threats, is your best form of prevention.
The virus is transmitted by droplets or contact.
So, following the CDC non-pharmaceutical advisory makes a lot of sense:
Wash your hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds, and help young children do the same.
Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact, such as kissing, or sharing cups or eating utensils, with sick people.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as toys and doorknobs.
Add to that the NHS guidance, which has only two items in common with the CDC advice (see brackets):
(wash your hands with soap and water often – do this for at least 20 seconds)
always wash your hands when you get home or into work
use hand sanitiser gel if soap and water are not available
(cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when you cough or sneeze)
put used tissues in the bin straight away and wash your hands afterwards
try to avoid close contact with people who are unwell
The don’ts are clearly spelled out by the NHS: “do not touch your eyes, nose or mouth if your hands are not clean.” So there’s a real possibility that if you use a disposable mask, especially a next-to-useless dust mask, you’ll increase, not decrease your risk of infection.
Taking this advice from the CDC and NHS into account, as well as the overall picture of the threat both from infection and from our efforts to mitigate infection, it’s not difficult to consider many reactions to COVID-19 as an over-reaction.
OK – if we’re talking about a very large public meeting for the over-70s in a country or region with known infection by the virus, stop the meeting. Some golf clubs and Bingo halls might be affected, but it won’t bring economies to a standstill. Otherwise, let people get on with their lives, cognisant of the hygiene and sanitation measures. We must also demand more transparency in the reporting.
So keep an eye on the stats, and we’re finding there’s more relevant data delivered daily by Worldometer than there is by the WHO itself.
What the data so far suggest to us is that the vast majority of people (>97%) will be fine, even with infection. Most people will at most have mild symptoms that are not very different from the closely related common cold. Efforts should be made, just as is the case routinely with flu, to in particular protect the most vulnerable groups, especially older people with underlying conditions.
Doing a lot more than all of this right now looks to us like the product of fertile minds and fear-mongering.
Conclusions
COVID-19 has now achieved pandemic status. That label generates fear. Yet the decision is based on geography, not biology. So while some estimates suggest two-thirds of the global population will become infected, for many this might just involve a ‘sniffle and a tickle’ – or be entirely without symptoms.
As stated by the WHO’s Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus,  “it would be the first pandemic in history that could be controlled.” More importantly, this could be achieved largely without pharmaceuticals or vaccines – just human cooperation around containment and control.
The way things are currently looking, in our view, the biggest cost of the pandemic will not be through suffering and illness. It will be economic. In order to reduce this impact, employers, event managers, transportation companies, health authorities and all those responsible for how those they communicate with behave, need to think things threw very carefully, before knee-jerking.
I was invited to speak at two major conferences next week in London. One has been cancelled (today), the other (at the time of writing) is going ahead. I am impressed with the lead taken by William Reed Business Media Ltd, the publisher of Food Navigator and NutraIngredients, for persevering with the Global CBD Summit and publishing coronavirus safety measures on the website.
I found myself resonating with the commentary in the BMJ offered by Dr Peter Gøtzsche, expelled co-founder of the Cochrane Collaboration and founder of the Institute for Scientific Freedom in Copenhagen. So, let’s finish with Dr Gøtzsche’s words as he explores the notion of us being potential “victims of mass panic”.
He asks:
“Why all the panic? Is it evidence-based healthcare to close schools and universities, cancel flights and meetings, forbid travel, and to isolate people wherever they happen to fall ill? In Denmark, the government recommends cancellation of events with over 1000 participants. When some organisers crept just below 1000, they were attacked by professors in virology and microbiology. But if it is wrong to invite 990 people, it should also be wrong to invite 980, and so forth. Where does this stop? And should big shopping centres be closed, too?”

Will the Citizens of Maine Become the First to Overturn a Mandatory Vaccine Law by Popular Vote?,"

Maine Residents Could Restore Vaccine Exemptions by Popular Vote on March 3 Ballot
by Barbara Cáceres
The Vaccine Reaction
On May 24, 2019, Maine’s House of Representatives passed a bill (LD798) removing religious and philosophical vaccine exemptions to block Maine residents from getting an education in a public, private, parochial or trade school or enrolling in educational courses online.
The bill also removed vaccine exemptions for students to attend colleges and universities, and barred adults from being employed in daycare or healthcare services unless they have received all state mandated vaccines.
The bill was strongly opposed by grassroots health freedom groups and passed the state Senate by only one vote.  When Governor Janet Mills signed LD 798 into law the same day, Maine joined Mississippi, West Virginia, California and New York, as states that only offer a medical exemption to vaccination.
Unless it is vetoed by Maine voters in a ballot vote on Mar. 3, 2020, the new law will go into effect on Sept. 1, 2021.
Maine Health Department Seeking 100 Percent Vaccination Rate
Maine is one of the 10 least populated states in the U.S. with a population of about 1.3 million people, which is less than one half of one percent of the total population of the U.S.1
In 2018, the Maine Department of Health and Human Services issued the National Immunization Survey Childhood Report of vaccination coverage in Maine for child and teen vaccinations recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and stated,
In 2018, the Health Department reported that, “Maine is either at, or above, the national average for every childhood vaccine, with the exception of hepatitis B. Maine saw an increase of over 1.3% for the primary vaccine series [and] Maine saw an increase in every individual antigen and overall series.”2
State health officials also made it clear that they were seeking a 100 percent vaccination rate among all children in the state:
Vaccination is the most effective and efficient way to ensure these children, their family members and the community, particularly those who are immunocompromised, are protected against these vaccine preventable diseases. This is perhaps one of the most important reasons why MIP will continue to encourage parents and physicians to vaccinate their children and to help reach the goal of the Maine Immunization Program to bring the State vaccine coverage rate for each of these vaccines to 100%.
Opposition to Bill Inside and Outside of Legislature
During public hearings in the spring of 2019 on LD798, testimony was received by 781 citizens and organizations. State House and Senate committees listened to more than 13 hours of testimony from nearly 200 people, 80 percent of whom opposed the bill forcing vaccination with federally recommended vaccines as a condition of getting a primary, high school, college or trade school education in Maine.
Speaking out against the bill, Maine Rep. Heidi Sampson addressed the House, reminding fellow legislators that
“the Constitution is designed to protect the minority. How dare we strip these people of their rights?”
She said:
I want to be clear. The people will not go away quietly. We as a body have done them a huge disservice. They have been mocked, ridiculed, disenfranchised, dismissed, insulted, ignored, set up for ambush, bullied and stigmatized. Let me tell you, we’ve poked mama and papa bear. We’ve ignited a fire within them and they will fight. Members here may not realize the injustice that they’ve heaped upon these people with this most draconian measure. We have seriously overstepped our role and our oath of office.
Maine Voters Have Opportunity to Restore Vaccine Exemptions on Mar. 3
Mainers for Health and Parental Rights, a political action committee (PAC), filed paperwork with the state for a veto ballot referendum that would overturn the vaccine exemption repeal. In September 2019, the campaign filed 95,871 raw signatures, of which 79,056 were valid, exceeding the minimum of 63,067 signatures needed.3
Cara Sacks, co-chair of Mainers for Health and Parental Rights said on National Public Radio,
“Many Mainers have never heard of this incredibly punitive and overreaching law that allows our government to mandate medical intervention in exchange for receiving any kind of education, whether private or public.”
On October 17, 2019, Maine Secretary of State Dunlap announced that the veto referendum qualified to appear on the ballot at the statewide election on March 3, 2020.4
The veto referendum will appear on the ballot as “Question 1” and individuals and organizations campaigning to retain the law removing vaccine exemptions are organizing around a “No on 1” slogan. This position is represented by the Maine Families for Vaccines PAC. Yarmouth pediatrician Laura Blaisdell, MD, co-chair and co-founder of the PAC, argues that,
“We need to oppose this veto, because our public spaces are not currently safe from infectious disease outbreaks. We know that we’re having outbreaks in schools and in our communities, and that’s because our community immunity has been threatened.”5
The “Yes to 1 Maine to Reject Big Pharma” Mainers for Health and Parental Rights PAC has organized to veto LD 798 and restore religious and philosophical exemptions to mandatory vaccination. The PAC’s spokesperson Cara Sacks pointed out that:
It should be parents’ choice to make medical decisions for their children, and it should not be mandated by the government. Voting “Yes” simply restores Maine’s previous law, which has protected Maine children well for decades and leaves medical decisions between patients and doctors. Rather than letting Mainers decide for ourselves, Big Pharma is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in a desperate attempt to influence this vote.6
Vaccine Industry Jumps In With Big Money to Defeat Voter Referendum to Restore Vaccine Exemptions
By early February, the “Yes on 1” Mainers for Health and Parents Rights PAC had raised far more money than the Maine Families for Vaccines PAC in the fundraising race, securing $315,752 in donations to the pro-mandatory vaccination Maine Families for Vaccines PAC’s $58,097 in donations.7 Sacks commented that:
The vast majority of our donors and donations are from everyday Mainers rather than the typical corporate and out-of-state interests that fund the majority of Maine political campaigns. Among the donors are many who identify themselves as therapists, counselors, acupuncturists, nurses, physicians and chiropractors. Many health practitioners, particularly those who are not funded or lobbied by Big Pharma oppose this terrible law because it removes their patient’s right to informed consent, a sacred and foundational principle of our modern medical system.8
The Maine Families for Vaccines PAC received the majority of their donations from the Maine Hospital Association, Maine Academy of Family Physicians, and the Maine Medical Association.9 
Although the PAC has characterized itself as a grassroots organization that has not accepted money from “Big Pharma,” they have engaged Maine Street Solutions, a public relations/lobbying firm. Bobby Reynolds, a spokesman for the political committee linked to Maine Street Solutions, said the group was funded largely by health care groups and vaccine manufacturers.10
Maine Street Solutions has spent $476,000 to blanket southern Maine with television ads featuring doctors and children talking about the value of vaccines and the need to keep the law repealing vaccine exemptions. This has opened up questions about whether Maine Families for Vaccines and those lobbying against repeal of LD798 are beholden to the pharmaceutical industry, especially vaccine manufacturers.11
Questions About Pharma’s Influence Over Vaccine Policy
In her weekly radio address, Gov. Mills said the grassroots PAC campaigning to overturn Maine’s new vaccination law is using misleading tactics by suggesting Big Pharma is behind the law. Mills said the large pharmaceutical companies “hardly benefit at all from producing vaccines….their campaign is purposefully trying to conflate vaccinations with other issues like the opioid epidemic when these issues are distinctly different,” Mills said.12
According to a survey from Zion Market Research, the total market size for vaccines in the United States is estimated to generate $18 billion for the pharmaceutical industry by 2020, and the pediatric vaccine market is expected to more than double from $6.1 billion in 2014 to $13.8 billion in 2024.13 Big pharmaceutical companies like Merck, Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, and Sanofi lead the global vaccine market.
According to Dr. Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, pharmaceutical company revenue from school-required vaccines is a “tiny fraction” of pharmaceutical industry profits.14 Physicians not only benefit financially from directly administering vaccines to patients, but also from industry sponsored incentive programs like CDC’s AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives eXchange Program) and other insurance related programs.15
After watching pharmaceutical and medical industry lobbyists operate in Augusta, Maine’s Capitol, last May, Rep. Sampson observed that, “Maine is a small state that’s easily bought. We have 1.3 million people and special interests don’t even need a lot of money… for a million dollars they can convince policy makers to do their bidding. Policy makers here don’t even look under the hood of these laws.  We’re like a cheap date. And if you can get Maine to do it, you can get the rest of the country to do it.”16
Vaccine Coverage and Exemption Rates in Maine
Before LD 798, Maine was one of 17 states that provided a philosophical exemption to vaccination, in addition to the religious and medical exemptions.
In the 2018-2019 school year, a total of 6.2 percent of entering kindergarteners were exempt, with 0.6 percent holding a medical exemption, 0.4 percent claiming a religious exemption, and 5.2 percent claiming philosophical exemption. During the same period, exemptions for seventh graders were lower:  a total of 4.7 percent were exempt, 0.1 percent holding a medical exemption, 0.3 percent claiming religious exemption and 4.3 percent claiming philosophical exemption.17
Between kindergarten and first grade, vaccination rates go up because many parents wait until the end of the acceptable age range for boosters, which the CDC says is between four and six years old. Parents of five year olds will often use a philosophical exemption for kindergarten and get the booster before first grade.
In 2015-2016, vaccination coverage rates in Maine for children entering kindergarten were 96.1 percent for the DTaP (diptheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis), 95.1 percent for the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella), 96 percent for the polio vaccine, and 96.1 percent for the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine.18 In 2018-2019, vaccination rates for the DTaP was 94.5 percent, MMR was 93.8 percent, polio was 94.5 percent and varicella was 95.9 percent.19
Infection Rates in Maine: No Deaths and Zero Cases of Measles
Maine’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports the incidence of infectious disease in 2018 (the last year for which a report is available) for which schoolchildren receive vaccines as follows: measles (0), mumps (4), rubella (0), diptheria (0), pertussis or “whooping cough” (446), tetanus (0), hepatitis A (9), meningococcal disease (1), varicella or “chickenpox” (252).20 There were no deaths resulting from these infections in Maine.
Maine has more pertussis (whooping cough) cases than other states, for reasons that are not entirely clear but which may have to do with waning vaccine immunity, changes in the pertussis bacteria, asymptomatic and undiagnosed vaccinated carriers who unknowingly transmit the disease, or pockets of unvaccinated individuals. Nationally, in 2018 there were 15,609 reported cases of pertussis, down from 18,975 in 2017. The CDC has stated that 37.9 percent of reported pertussis cases in children under age six were in individuals who had received the primary 3-dose series of pertussis-containing vaccine and only 9.4 percent had not received any pertussis containing vaccine.21
Maine had one case of measles reported just days before the May 2019 vote. The child, who recovered, was fully vaccinated. It was unclear where the child, contracted the infection and whether it was vaccine strain or wild type measles. The only other measles case reported in Maine the past 20 years was in 2017.
Citizens Want Legal Right to Make Voluntary Vaccine Decisions
“The new law is a grotesque government overreach masquerading as public health,” says Rep. Sampson. She has been joined in opposition to LD 798 by Rep. Justin Fecteau, who said:
In Maine, we don’t have a vaccine issue, we have an issue with government telling us what to do with our bodies. The “No on 1” campaign has resorted to “cheap fear-mongering. This has nothing to do with safety and everything to do with authoritarianism.
A Plea From Parents
In testimony last May, Rep. Robert Foley shared his perspective as a father whose daughter died hours after getting vaccinated:
“Unless you believe that healthy babies die for no reason, then I ask you to respect parents who have gone through what my wife and I have gone through,” he pleaded.22
Sarah Saffiere, whose five year-old son was diagnosed with a condition that compromises his immune system testified that she is “petrified” for him to be exposed to unvaccinated students.
“It is one group against another. Both parties can’t win and so it is emotional,” said Staffiere.
On March 3rd, Mainers will vote for whether or not state health officials will have the power to enforce the use of federally recommended vaccines for every child and adult seeking a school education in Maine.

Dr. Brownstein: What to Avoid and What to Take for Coronavirus,"       

Coronavirus IX: What to Avoid–Ibuprofen–And What to Take
by David Brownstein, M.D.
DrBrownstein.com
Our misery continues! Today, I went to buy my mother toilet paper at 6am and the local grocery store shelves were emptied. Do not fear, as I found it later at a different store. Later today, mom tasked me with finding eggs. That took two different stores as well before I found them!
But, this is a time not to panic.  It is a time to pull together and support each other.   Many are recovering uneventfully–we just don’t hear about it.  I have seen numerous patients over the past month that may have had it.  I couldn’t test them because of a lack of kits, but they all recovered.  Of course some are very sick and dying.
Overall, I believe we will come through this with a death rate similar or slightly higher than the rate for the common flu. But, we will never know the true numbers because of a lack of test kits.  I do not think this crises will persist into the summer months. As we begin to test more patients, we will see the mortality rate decline.
Of course, those are only my predictions we know that viruses can mutate.  This virus is very contagious but it is a flu-like illness for most who get it.  That must be kept in mind. And, eating a healthy diet and maintaining optimal hydration can help dramatically. More about that later.
We are in this mess due to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If the CDC had done their job, COVID-19 would be contained and manageable. The Powers-That-Be at the CDC failed miserably compared to other countries. My recent blog post “Coronavirus VIII: Why Does S. Korea Have Lower Death Rate Compared to US?” was about the success in S. Korea at fighting COVID-19.
Taiwan is another example for the US CDC to learn from. As of March 13, Taiwan has 50 COVID-19 cases and 1 death. (1) Keep in mind that Taiwan is 81 miles from mainland China and has 24 million citizens. A March 3, 2020 JAMA article detailed the rapid and complete response the Taiwanese health authorities implemented at the beginning of this crisis.
December 31, 2019 was the day Chinese officials notified the WHO that Chinese citizens were suffering unusually severe cases of pneumonia. That same day Taiwan began monitoring all passengers who arrived from Wuhan. A few days later, they started monitoring all people who had travelled to Wuhan since December 20. They increased their surveillance and testing and the rest is history; 50 cases and 1 death as of March 13, 2020.
I have discussed what our CDC did in previous blog posts. They refused test kits from the WHO, developed their own faulty kits and refused private labs from testing sick individuals. The postmortem on this story will be ugly for the CDC. We are in a mess now with COVID-19 spreading across the country.
But, all is not lost. As I have detailed in other posts, there are many things you can do to improve your immune system and help you avoid COVID-19 problems:
– Eat a healthy diet FREE OF REFINED SUGAR! It should also be free of all refined food sources including salt, flour, and oils. Remember, refined sugar paralyzes the ability of white blood cells to perform their duties for hours.
– Make sure you always STAY WELL HYDRATED with clean water. Take your weight in pounds, divide the  number by 2 and the resultant number is the minimum amount of water in ounces to drink per day.
– NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS can help to improve the immune system’s ability to fight off an infection and to help it kill an active infection. I have over 25 years of practicing holistic medicine to back that statement up. I have seen it work. My partners have seen it work. My patients have seen it work.  We have used this approach successfully for many viral infections.  I have no doubt it will work for COVID-19 as well.
In my blog post “Coronavirus Part Vl: Why COVID-19 Is More Deadly to the Chinese” (3) I told you why COVID-19 was more deadly to younger Chinese males. Most Chinese men smoke cigarettes. Smoking increases ACE2 receptors in the lungs where COVID-19 has been shown to bind to. Similarly, ibuprofen has been shown to increase ACE 2 expression. (4)
Ibuprofen should be avoided as it may enhance the infectious capabilities of COVID-19. Ibuprofen also causes problems for the kidneys and the GI tract. It is best to let the body utilize its innate abilities to fight an infection. One of the body’s main ways to do this is by mounting a fever. The increased body temperature is a way to mobilize the immune system into action as well as to enhance the killing effect of a foreign invader. Fevers can often be managed by tepid baths, lots of hydration and rest.
It is important to maintain electrolyte balance with any infection but particularly when there is fever involved. Supplementing with unrefined salt is crucial here. It can be added to each glass of water. Again, it is best to work with a knowledgeable health care provider before doing any of the suggestions I have written about.
Acetaminophen should also be avoided for fevers.  It depletes a crucial antioxidant–glutathione.  In fact, acetaminophen should be severely limited for any condition.  It has a poor safety profile.
Dr. B’s antiviral protocol for his patients during acute illness or exposure to someone ill:
Vitamin A (NOT beta carotene)
– Adults: 100,000 IU/day for four days for adults (not pregnant or breast-feeding women)
– Children 25-50 pounds: 20,000 IU/day for four days
– Children 50-100 pounds: 50,000 IU/day for four days
Vitamin D3
– Adults: —50,000 IU/day for four days
– Children 25-50 pounds: 10,000 IU/day
– Children: 50-100 pounds: 25,000 IU/day
(Note: Both Vitamin A and D are fat-soluble vitamins. They can build up in the body. These doses are NOT meant to be taken for longer than four days at time. If you need to repeat the doses, seek advice from your physician.)
Vitamin C: 5-10,000 mg/day.  If you can take more do it.  If you get loose stools, lower it.
Iodine: 25-100 mg/day and more if ill.  Kids can take lower doses.
-Children:  A useful number is to use 0.08mg/pound.
Don’t forget intravenous nutrient therapies are essential for helping the immune system in a time of crises.  A holistic doctor skilled in nutrient IV therapy can help guide you.  I have found IV hydrogen peroxide, ozone, and vitamin C wonderful treatments for my patients.  We would have a lot less death and misery from COVID-19 if these life-saving therapies were taught in medical schools and utilized in hospitals.
Final Thoughts
This crises will pass. When it does, we need new leadership at CDC, FDA, and HHS. They have all failed us. You don’t have to wait for the Government to come to your rescue. You can take matters into your own hands. Find a holistic doctor who can help you achieve your optimal health. We are ready at the Center for Holistic Medicine to begin the journey with you.
To All Our Health,

U.S. Marines and Navy Prepare to Execute Pandemic Plan As Questions Resurface About Coronavirus Origin,"       

by Barbara Loe Fisher
The Vaccine Reaction
Responding to the coronavirus outbreak in China, where tens of thousands of citizens suspected of being infected with coronavirus (COVID-2019) have been detained and involuntarily taken to quarantine camps,1 on Feb. 1, 2020 an executive order was issued by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), including the Joint Chiefs of Staff, directing the U.S. Northern Command to implement the DoD’s Global Campaign Plan for Pandemic and Infectious Diseases.2
On Feb. 12, 2020, orders were sent to the U.S. Marine Corps3 and Navy4 directing “geographic combatant commanders to execute their pandemic plans in response to the NCOV outbreak.”
The U.S. Marine Corps directive told combat commanders to “review, update and validate existing disease containment plans and policies in order to implement procedures for response, isolation, quarantine, restriction of movement and community-based intervention” and to “become familiar with authority to declare a public health emergency, restrict movement, quarantine and isolate [and[ coordinate with Federal, State, local, and military treatment facilities and public health emergency officials…”
The U.S. Navy directive stated, “DoD will continue to follow CDC guidance and comply with local public health authorities during this outbreak.”
As of Feb. 18, 2020, there had been 75,198 cases of COVID-2019 detected globally and 2,009 deaths, with all but 1,013 cases and 5 deaths occurring in China.5
The U.S. now has 29 confirmed cases being treated on military bases or in a biocontainment facility.
Reports by Chinese Scientists Raise Questions About Origin of Coronavirus
At the same time, over the past week new questions have resurfaced about whether the novel coronavirus (COVID-2019) can be traced back to scientific research conducted in Wuhan labs, a subject that has been widely discussed since January after the outbreak in China emerged.6 
According to a Feb. 16 report in the Daily Mail, scientists at the South China University of Technology have written a paper questioning whether research on bats and respiratory diseases at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control (WCDC) created a new chimeric coronavirus capable of infecting humans.
The WCDC is located just 300 yards from the fish and wildlife food market thought to be the origin of the coronavirus and is adjacent to the Union Hospital where the first group of doctors were infected.7
On Feb. 15, a paper was published in The Lancet by Chinese scientists, “Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.”
The authors stated, “In December, 2019, a series of pneumonia cases of unknown cause emerged in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with clinical presentations greatly resembling viral pneumonia” and they described 41 cases hospitalized by Jan. 2, 2020, of which 66 percent (27 people) had been exposed to the food market and 15 percent (6 people) died:
Most of the infected patients were men (30 [73%] of 41); less than half had underlying diseases (13 [32%]), including diabetes (eight [20%]), hypertension (six [15%]), and cardiovascular disease (six [15%]).
Median age was 49·0 years (IQR 41·0–58·0). 27 (66%) of 41 patients had been exposed to Huanan seafood market…Complications included acute respiratory distress syndrome (12 [29%]), RNAaemia (six [15%]), acute cardiac injury (five [12%]) and secondary infection (four [10%]). 13 (32%) patients were admitted to an ICU and six (15%) died.8
The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to maintain that the new virus spontaneously jumped from animals, most likely bats, to humans in the Wuhan market selling seafood and wildlife animals and that online speculation to the contrary is “misinformation.”
In early February, International Business Times reported that WHO had teamed up with Google to battle online “misinformation” about the epidemic.9
A Feb. 14 CNBC report revealed that the WHO hosted a meeting at Facebook’s Menlo Park, California campus with Google, Amazon, You Tube, Twitter, Verizon and other big tech companies to discuss how to “tamp down on misinformation about the coronavirus.10

CDC Preparing for Novel Coronavirus to “gain a foothold in the U.S.”
According to the Atlanta Journal Constitution, on Feb. 12 Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told media during a conference call “we can and should be prepared for this new virus to gain a foothold in the U.S.”11
On Feb. 14, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced that in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and New York City, the agency had begun monitoring Americans with flu-like symptoms, who test negative for influenza, by additionally lab testing them for coronavirus.
According to CNBC, the CDC intends to add more cities in the coming weeks in an effort to achieve a “national surveillance” system that would act as an early warning that COVID-2019 is spreading, which would “trigger a change in our response strategy,” said Messonnier.12
A report by Reuters stated:
The CDC’s current strategy to fight the virus includes quarantines and travel restrictions, but that may change if the virus takes hold in the United States and begins to spread. In that scenario, the CDC will put in place “social distancing” strategies such as cancelling mass gatherings, using telemedicine, tele-schooling and remote working to try to disrupt the spread of the virus.13[xiii]
Americans on Diamond Princess Cruise Ship Test Positive
More than 600 Americans, who were evacuated from Wuhan, China in early February, have been in quarantined in the U.S. and some have already been released.
Other Americans suspected to have come in contact with COVID-2019 have been quarantined on cruise ships.  On Feb. 16, about 380 U.S. citizens on the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined in a Japanese harbor, who had not tested positive for coronavirus and were symptom-free, were offered seats on U.S. State Department chartered flights transporting them back to quarantine centers on military bases in California and Texas.
According to CNBC, about 300 Americans accepted the State Department’s offer to fly back to the U.S., while nearly 100 others with no symptoms of illness decided to stay on the ship.14
On Feb. 17, the U.S. State Department and Department of Health and Human Services issued a joint statement acknowledging that 14 asymptomatic American evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were allowed to fly on the chartered flights despite testing positive for coronavirus before getting on the planes.15
According to USA Today, when the planes landed at military bases in Texas and California, 13 passengers who had tested positive for the virus were flown to the University of Nebraska Medical Center and Nebraska Medicine quarantine and biocontainment facility in Omaha for treatment.
All of the Americans returning from the Diamond Princess will remain in quarantine for 14 days. 16
By Feb. 18, there had been 542 cases of COVID-2019 diagnosed among the cruise ships’ 3,700 passengers and crew. 17 Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told USA Today that, “The quarantine process failed.”18
Posse Comitatus Act of 1878
The scope of the mission of the U.S. Marines and U.S. Navy’s involvement in implementing the DoD’s Global Campaign Plan for Pandemic and Infectious Diseases in a civilian population is not clear as that Plan does not appear to have been publicly released by DoD.
In general, however, the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act (PCA) prohibits the carte blanche use of military forces in civilian law enforcement in the U.S.19
According to an essay for the Encyclopedia Brittanica:20
The willful use of the army or air force as a posse comitatus or otherwise to execute the laws is a felony, unless the use is expressly authorized by the Constitution or an act of Congress.
The PCA directly applies only to the army and air force, without mentioning the navy, the Marine Corps, the Coast Guard, or the National Guard.
The National Guard is subject to Article I, section 8 of the Constitution, “To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.”
The National Guard is under state control until called into federal service, and is authorized to enforce the laws upon the request of a governor.
Because the Coast Guard has a law enforcement function and is not under the control of the Department of Defense, it is not subject to the PCA.
Although the naval service is not mentioned in the PCA, Department of Defense regulations extend the PCA to the navy and Marine Corps.
Establishment of the U.S. Northern Command After 9/11
After terrorist attacks on the U.S. mainland on Sept. 11, 2001 (9/11), the U.S. Northern Command was established Oct. 1, 2002.
According to a 2008 report to Congress by the Congressional Research Service,
“In 2002, President Bush signed a new Unified Command Plan (UCP) establishing United States Northern Command (NORTHCOM) to provide command and control of the Department of Defense’ (DOD’s) homeland defense efforts and coordinate military support to civil authorities.”21
NORTHCOM’s area of responsibility includes the continental United States, Alaska, Canada, Mexico, and surrounding waters out to approximately 500 nautical miles, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Straits of Florida.
Headquartered at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, the NORTHCOM Commander also commands North American Aerospace Defense Command.22
U.S. Northern Command’s mission is to deter, prevent and defeat threats and aggression aimed at the United States, its territories, and interests. To this end personnel from the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard are assigned to coordinate the protection of North America from external threats, drawing on the full capabilities of all U.S. military services, including the National Guard and Coast Guard, as necessary.
Additionally, the command is charged with providing defense support for civil authorities when approved by the President or Secretary of Defense. U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) also provides military resources and support to federal, state and local authorities.23
According to the USNORTHCOM website, so far it “has not had to respond to a large scale threat calling for military intervention” in U.S. territory.
It has primarily been used to respond to natural or manmade disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, earthquakes and a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, emphasizing that “the philosophy behind USNORTHCOM’s participation in defense support for civil authorities was to be prepared at all times but only to act when requested and to depart just as soon as their support was no longer required.”24
The Feb. 12 DoD directives to the Navy and Marine Corps indicated that officials of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) made the request to DoD and USNORTHCOM to get involved in anticipation of widespread coronavirus infections in the U.S. and that combatant commanders implementing DoD’s Global Campaign Plan for Pandemic and Infectious Diseases would be following directions from HHS and state and local public health officials.
Post 9/11 Model State Emergency Health Powers Act
After terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001 (9/11), and subsequent reports of biological warfare threats against U.S. citizens, federal health officials immediately began preparing for mass anthrax and smallpox vaccination campaigns in the U.S.
At the same time, model state legislation entitled the Model State Emergency Health Powers Act (MSEHPA) was introduced in multiple states to rewrite state public health laws and give federal and state public health officials sweeping new power over citizens when public health “emergencies” were declared by the Secretary of HHS and state governors.
The CDC had given Professor Lawrence Gostin, PhD, of the Center for Law and the Public’s Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins University, funding to develop the model legislation, which is why MSEHPA could be quickly introduced in the states the month after 9/11.25 Among its provisions, MSEHPA gave power to public health officials to:
take control of all roads leading into and out of cities and states;
seize homes, cars, telephones, computers, food, fuel, clothing, firearms and alcoholic beverages for their own use (and not be held liable if these actions result in the destruction of  personal property);
arrest, imprison and forcibly examine, vaccinate and medicate citizens without consent (and not be held liable if these actions result in death or injury).
The ACLU and other NGO’s defending civil liberties,26 27 including the National Vaccine Information Center,28 29 opposed the MSEHPA for giving too much power to government health officials to detain, isolate and force vaccination and other medical interventions on citizens without their voluntary informed consent.30
The ACLU described the proposed model legislation as being “replete with civil liberties violations” and failing to “adequately protect citizens against the misuse of the tremendous powers that it would grant [government health authorities] in an emergency.”31
In August 2002, Professor Gostin and his colleagues at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities argued for compulsory quarantine and treatment of individuals in an article for the Journal of the American Medical Association:32
Coercive powers are the most controversial aspects of any legal system… There similarly may be a need to exercise powers over individuals to avert a significant threat to the public’s health. Vaccination, testing, physical examination, treatment, isolation, and quarantine each may help contain the spread of infectious diseases. Although the vast majority of people probably will comply willingly (because it is in their interests and/or desirable for the common welfare), some compulsory powers are necessary for those who will not comply.
In 2003, Gostin replied to critics of the MSEHPA, pointing out that “The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in Healthy People 2010, similarly argued that strong laws are a vital component of the public health infrastructure and recommended that states reform their outdated statutes.”
He defended restraint of individual liberty in service to the public health: “When government acts to preserve the public’s health, it can interfere with property rights (e.g., freedom of contract, to pursue a profession, or to conduct a business) or personal rights (e.g., autonomy, privacy, and liberty).
The history of public health is littered with illustrations of trade offs between public health and civil liberties.” 33
Gostin questioned American values about “personal and proprietary freedoms” at the turn of the 21st century that opposed “substantial government presence in social and economic life,” and he expressed the opinion that 9/11 “reawakened the political community to the importance of public health:”
American values at the turn of the 21st century fairly could be characterized as individualistic. There was a distinct orientation toward personal and proprietary freedoms and against a substantial government presence in social and economic life. The attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon and the anthrax outbreaks reawakened the political community to the importance of public health. Historians will look back and ask whether September 11, 2001 was a fleeting scare with temporary solutions or whether it was a transforming event.
By 2011, 44 states had passed some form of the MSEHPA.34
After 9/11 Congress Gave More Power to Executive Branch
After 9/11, immediately there were allegations that terrorists possessed weaponized smallpox and anthrax that could be used against the U.S. mainland population. Pressure was placed on Congress to create legislation to protect the American public from future bioterrorism attacks.
Congress passed and President George W. Bush signed a series of new laws between 2002 and 2006 that gave expanded powers to the Executive Branch of the federal government and especially strengthened the authority of HHS during declared public health emergencies that involve disease control.
The Homeland Security Act of 200235 created the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which assumed authority over existing federal agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Immigration and Customs Service (ICE), U.S. Secret Service, Transportation Security Administration (TSA), among others. DHS works closely with HHS to respond to public health emergencies.
The National Vaccine Information Center opposed certain provisions in the Homeland Security Act of 2002.36
The Project Bioshield Act of 2004 (“Bioshield 1”)37 38 and Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 (“Bioshield 2”)39 40 set up and funded a public-private financial partnership between private pharmaceutical companies and HHS to research and develop bioterrorism and pandemic vaccines for use by U.S. civilian populations. The 2006 Act amended the Public Health Service Act to require the Secretary of HHS to lead all federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies.
The National Vaccine Information Center opposed sections of the 2004 and 2006 Bioshield legislation, calling for responsible congressional oversight on expanded authority granted to federal public health officials by Congress after 9-11.41 42
In the 2004 Bioshield Act, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was given an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)43 that allows experimental drugs and vaccines designated as medical countermeasures (MCM) to be fast tracked to licensure during a federally declared public health emergency.
The Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act of 2006 established the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) under HHS as the central point of authority within the federal government responsible for conducting advanced research to develop civilian medical countermeasures in collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry.
BARDA is shielded from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Drug companies are shielded from liability if the drugs or vaccines developed for and used in HHS declared public health emergencies cause injury or death and so are persons forcing civilians to use the products.44
In 2019, Congress passed The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act, strengthening the original 2006 Act.45 This new law increased funding for HHS programs and BARDA research to develop genetically engineered vaccines to respond to emerging pandemics and antimicrobial resistance.46
In addition, the government’s official “isolate and quarantine” list was expanded between 2003 and 2014 to include Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers, such as Ebola, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS),47 adding pandemic influenza in 2005.48
In 2014, the Presidential Executive Order did not name a specific disease that would warrant detention and quarantine, it simply described “diseases associated with fever and signs and symptoms of pneumonia or other respiratory illness” that have “the potential to cause a pandemic” or are “highly likely to cause mortality or serious morbidity if not properly controlled.”49
In 2016, using rule making authority to amend the Public Health Service Act, HHS expanded their police powers to apprehend individuals or their minor children entering the U.S. or traveling across state borders by airplane, ship, bus or train, and isolate or involuntarily quarantine them if they have minor symptoms of illness that could indicate “they are or may become infected with quarantinable infectious diseases.”50
In a public comment to HHS, the National Vaccine Information Center opposed sections of the proposed amendment giving HHR more power to detain, involuntarily quarantine and compel individuals to submit to vaccination as condition for release:51
Health officials in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), have more than enough authority under the U.S. Constitution and the Public Health Service Act to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of a short list of serious communicable diseases with very high mortality rates, such as hemorrhagic fevers.
However, this NPRM makes a point of equating non-quarantinable vaccine-targeted diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, with quarantinable diseases, such as tuberculosis and smallpox. It expands the list of minor illness symptoms that could trigger the use of police power by government health officials to apprehend and involuntarily quarantine individuals, who can be asked to consent to vaccination as a condition of release from government custody.
Microsoft News: Coronavirus Vaccine Will Eliminate Need for Quarantines

On Feb. 6, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced that it is pledging up to $100 million to combat coronavirus and “help find a vaccine for the virus, limit its spread and improve detection and treatment of patients.”
Immediately, $20 million will go to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization.52
Since the Gates Foundation was established in 2000, with a primary goal of funding global public health initiatives, more than $3 billion has been given to fund global vaccination programs.53
Microsoft News, which is owned by Microsoft, a corporation co-founded by Bill Gates, stated that a coronavirus vaccine would end quarantines:
First appearing late December of 2019, the new coronavirus (called the COVID-19) managed to kill almost 1,400 people and infect several thousands more in Mainland China alone in a mere two months, putting people to pin their hopes on one of the most effective disease-fighting tools: a vaccine.
Having one would mean that there would no longer be a need to quarantine people nor close off cities and monitor airports because people would be protected from the virus even before they get exposed.54

Dr. Brownstein: Politicians Making Big Decisions Based on Fear and not Based on Data,"       
Coronavirus XII: There Is Good News
by David Brownstein, M.D.
DrBrownstein.com
I was at Costco yesterday and did NOT enjoy my experience. The tension was palpable everywhere. (Note: This had nothing to do with Costco.) There were shoppers wearing N95 masks. That irritated me. The masks are in short supply for front-line health care workers and there is simply no reason to wear that at Costco. COVID is not passed that easily through the air.
Folks, the fear level out there is beyond reason. Unfortunately, my Governor and the rest of our lawmakers, including those in Washington, are making big decisions based on fear and not based on data. As I have been writing to you, the data is out there that COVID-19 is serious but only to a small percentage of our population—when all is said and done, less than 1%.
Could I be wrong? Of course, it wouldn’t be the first time. But, I have learned to do my own research and trust myself with the conclusions I come to. I utilize my research and my practical experience in order to make an appropriate decision about how to treat my patients or how to approach this COVID-19 pandemic.
I have been practicing medicine for over 25 years. During that time I have become a much better physician than I was at the beginning (at least I hope so). In medical school you learn far too many things that have no relevance in the real practice of medicine. Only when you get out in the real world does the real teaching begin. But, medical school did teach me important tools to become a competent physician.
One of the main things I was taught in medical school was to observe my patients. That was an important lesson. I observe how they look, walk, sound, and act. And, I observe recurring patterns with respect to diseases.
I have found it useful to observe disease patterns since many diseases consistently appear and disappear according to the calendar. One pattern that consistently repeats itself is that the flu season (for most) seems to start around the winter solstice (December 20-23) and ends around the spring equinox (March 19-21). This year the spring equinox was on March 20, 2020.
I have seen the reports that COVID-19 may be going on for up to 18 months. Some commentators are saying that we need to quarantine for at least six months to a year to get rid of it.
I SAY, HOGWASH!
Look at the following chart from the CDC that summarizes the peak month of flu activity from 1982-2018:
You can see the season starts in October and November with low numbers, peaks in January and February and begins to decline in March. The peak month of activity can change between the months of January, February and March. Keep in mind, this chart is an average of the activity between 1982-2018.

I have observed, on a yearly basis, that my patients begin to get less colds and other influenza-like illnesses around the spring eqionox. Some go into April and few go into May with viral infections, but they are usually fewer and fewer the further away from the spring solstice date. My four partners—Drs. Ng and Nusbaum, Jenny and Taylor all concur with this assessment. Between all of us, we have over 100 years of experience seeing this pattern.
So, what does this have to do with COVID-19? COVID-19 is more contagious than the common flu, but not that much more contagious. The ‘R naught’ (RO) is an estimate for how many other people one sick person is likely to infect. The RO for the common flu is 1.3 meaning one person can spread it 1.3 others. The RO for COVID-19 is 2-3.11 meaning one infected person can spread it to 2-3.1 others. For comparison, the RO for measles is 11-18. COVID-19 is more contagious than the common flu but much less contagious than measles. This should limit how long the illness lasts.
Coronaviruses do not like warm temperatures and higher humidity. As we warm in the spring, that should help. But, as previously stated, I have seen the spring equinox lower the incidence of flu-like illnesses for over 25 years. Some years, it takes a little while longer than others. However, I am only referring to a few weeks after the equinox.
Let me finally jump off my cliff here without a parachute. (BTW, I had an interesting parachuting experience when I was 18—that is for another time.) I predict that COVID-19 will be begin to recede in its lethality over the next 2-3 weeks. The number of cases may still rise during this time because we have a back-log of tests and are testing more. I also predict the number of cases will begin to decline in 3-4 weeks–regardless of what we do. We are coming to the end of the flu season and I see no reason why COVID-19 would behave differently than any other flu-like virus.
Could I be wrong? Yes. The virus could mutate to a more aggressive strain. But, it could also mutate to a less lethal strain as well. Most highly aggressive and lethal viral strains eventually fade out after a short time on their own.
Time will tell if I am right. Unless this virus is markedly different than the other 200 or so flu-like viruses, we should be in for much better times very soon.
Don’t let your fear rise when all the new cases are reported. They are being reported in increasing numbers because we are testing more. The death rate is continuing to decline, just as I predicted it would. As of this writing (3.22.20), there have been 349 deaths and 29,270 infected. That results in a death rate of 1.2%. Initially, the US COIVD-19 fatality rate was between 2-3% (though I can’t cite this, I am taking this from my memory). This rate continues to decline because there are many more who recover uneventfully from COVID-19. The media only sensationalizes the very ill and dying. The headline on MSN right now epitomizes the fear-based reporting by stating, “US Death Toll Rises…” It is a true headline as more have died over the last 24 hours. Perhaps a better headline could read, “Death rate for COVID-19 falls as more are tested.”
Folks, I know this is serious stuff. People have died and more will die. It is important to not let fear guide your decisions. Fear is guiding our Government right now and that is not going well for us. Take your supplements. See a holistic doctor. Eat well—avoid refined sugar! Maintain optimal hydration. These are some of the holistic steps you can take to avoid becoming a statistic in this crisis. We will overcome this, and I think better times are coming soon.
To All Our Health,

"Coconut Oil’s History in Destroying Viruses, Including Coronaviruses","       

Comments by Brian Shilhavy
Editor, Health Impact News
People living in the Philippines, a country of islands not very far off the coast of China, remember all too well the last time a deadly coronavirus epidemic broke out in China.
It was 2003 when the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus broke out in China. It infected over 7000 people in China with over 600 recorded deaths.
Even with its close proximity to China and large Chinese population in the Philippine nation of about 80 million people, only 14 cases of SARS was reported with two recorded deaths.
Canada, many thousands of miles away, had far more cases and more deaths recorded due to SARS infection from China than neighboring Philippine Islands.
One of the theories put forward at the time as to why the Filipino people had so few cases, was the country’s predominant use of cooking oil: Coconut Oil.
The Philippines is the world’s largest producer of coconut oil, with about 70% of the world’s coconut oil being exported from the country.
The medium chain fatty acids of coconut oil, and primarily lauric acid, have been known to destroy enveloped viruses by researchers for many years.
Dr. Fabian Dayrit, Ph.D. and Dr. Mary Newport, M.D. have just published a paper regarding coconut oil’s potential to also combat the new coronavirus currently infecting people in China.
The Potential of Coconut Oil and its Derivatives as Effective and Safe Antiviral Agents Against the Novel Coronavirus (nCoV-2019)

Read the research of Professor Emeritus Dr. Fabian Antonio Dayrit (GS’67, HS’71, BS Chemistry ’75) and Dr. Mary Newport of Spring Hill Neonatolody, Inc. on the potential use of coconut oil as a safe antiviral agent against the novel coronavirus.
As we write this, the World Health Organization has declared a global emergency over the novel coronavirus, nCoV-2019, that has spread beyond China. There is still no cure for nCoV-2019. nCoV-2019 has been shown to be related to SARS (Zhou et al., 2020), a coronavirus which caused an outbreak in 2003.
Several researchers have been designing drugs to specifically target protease enzymes in coronavirus, but testing for these drugs is many months away. What if there is a treatment candidate against the coronavirus that might already be available and whose safety is already established?
Lauric acid (C12) and monolaurin, its derivative, have been known for many years to have significant antiviral activity. Lauric acid is a medium-chain fatty acid which makes up about 50% of coconut oil; monolaurin is a metabolite that is naturally produced by the body’s own enzymes upon ingestion of coconut oil and is also available in pure form as a supplement.
Sodium lauryl sulfate, a common surfactant that is made from lauric acid, has been shown to have potent antiviral properties. Lauric acid, monolaurin, and sodium lauryl sulfate (which is also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate) are used in a wide range of products for their antiviral properties.
Mechanisms of action
Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antiviral activity of lauric acid and monolaurin: first, they cause disintegration of the virus envelope; second, they can inhibit late maturation stage in the virus replicative cycle; and third, they can prevent the binding of viral proteins to the host cell membrane.
Disintegration of the virus membrane. The antiviral activities of lauric acid and monolaurin were first noted by Sands and co-workers (1979) and later by Hierholzer & Kabara (1982). In particular, Hierholzer & Kabara showed that monolaurin was able to reduce infectivity of 14 human RNA and DNA enveloped viruses in cell culture by >99.9%, and that monolaurin acted by disintegrating the virus envelope. Thormar and co-workers (1987) confirmed the ability of lauric acid and monolaurin to inactivate viruses by disintegration of the cell membrane. Sodium lauryl sulfate has been shown to be able to solubilize and denature the viral envelope (Piret 2000, 2002).
Inhibits virus maturation. The Junin virus (JUNV) is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. In a comparison among the saturated fatty acids from C10 to C18 against JUNV infection, Bartolotta and co-workers (2001) showed that lauric acid was the most active inhibitor. From mechanistic studies, it was concluded that lauric acid inhibited a late maturation stage in the replicative cycle of JUNV. From transmission electron microscope images, JUNV is an enveloped virus featuring glycoproteins that are embedded in the lipid bilayer forming viral spikes (Grant et al., 2012); this is similar to nCoV-2019.
Prevents binding of viral proteins to the host cell membrane. Hornung and co-workers (1994) showed that in the presence of lauric acid, the production of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus was inhibited in a dose-dependent and reversible manner: after removal of lauric acid, the antiviral effect disappeared. They observed that lauric acid did not influence viral membrane (M) protein synthesis, but prevented the binding of viral M proteins to the host cell membrane.
Although lauric acid accounts for much of the reported antiviral activity of coconut oil, capric acid (C10) and monocaprin have also shown promising activity against other viruses, such as HIV-1 (Kristmundsdóttir et al., 1999).
Capric acid accounts for about 7% of coconut oil. Thus, at least two fatty acids in coconut oil, and their monoglycerides, have antiviral properties. Hilarsson and co-workers (2007) tested virucidal activities of fatty acids, monoglycerides and fatty alcohols against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV2) at different concentrations, times and pH levels.
They reported the most active compound tested was monocaprin (C10), which also showed activity against influenza A virus and significant virucidal activities even at a concentration as low as 0.06-0.12%.
Use of coconut oil and C12 derivatives in animals and humans
Coconut oil and its derivatives have been shown to be safe and effective antiviral compounds in both humans and animals. Because of the antiviral and antibacterial protection that it provides to animals, coconut oil, as well as lauric acid and monolaurin, is used in farm animals and pets as veterinary feed supplements in chicken, swine and dogs (Baltic et al., 2017).
Monolaurin has been shown to effectively protect chicken against avian influenza virus (van der Sluis, 2015). Li and co- workers (2009) prepared a gel containing monolaurin and found it to be highly active against repeated high viral loads of Simean immunodeficiency virus in macaques and Kirtane and co- workers (2017) developed a 35% gel of monolaurin for application in the female genital tract to protect against HIV.
Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) has been used at low concentrations to inactivate viruses in milk of farm animals (de Sousa et al., 2019). SLS is the active constituent in commercial disinfecting wipes and standard laboratory disinfectants, and is an emulsifying agent and penetration enhancer in pharmaceutical preparations.
Coconut oil itself has been shown to have anti-HIV properties in small clinical studies. The first clinical trial using coconut oil (45 mL daily) and monolaurin (95% purity, 800 mg daily) against HIV-AIDS was conducted in the Philippines. This study involved 15 HIV patients, aged 22 to 38 years, 5 males and 10 females, for 6 months. There was only one fatality and 11 of the patients showed higher CD4 and CD8 counts after 6 months (Dayrit, 2000).
In another study, 40 HIV subjects with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts less than 200 cells/microliter were divided into a virgin coconut oil (VCO) group (45 mL daily) and control group (no VCO). After 6 weeks, the VCO group showed significantly higher average CD4+ T lymphocyte counts versus control (Widhiarta, 2016).
Conclusion
Several in vitro, animal, and human studies support the potential of coconut oil, lauric acid and its derivatives as effective and safe agents against a virus like nCoV-2019. Mechanistic studies on other viruses show that at least three mechanisms may be operating.
Given the considerable scientific evidence for the antiviral activity of coconut oil, lauric acid and its derivatives and their general safety, and the absence of a cure for nCoV-2019, we urge that clinical studies be conducted among patients who have been infected with nCoV-2019 (see below). This treatment is affordable and virtually risk-free, and the potential benefits are enormous.
On the other hand, given the safety and broad availability of virgin coconut oil (VCO), we recommend that VCO be considered as a general prophylactic against viral and microbial infection.
A proposed clinical study
We can propose that a clinical study be conducted on patients infected with nCoV-2019 accordingly:
Group 1: Control group, standard care
Group 2: standard care + VCO (45 mL, approx. 3 three tablespoons, daily or higher,)
Group 3: standard care + Monolaurin (95% purity, 800 mg daily). Monolaurin is recognized as GRAS by US FDA.
Group 4: standard care + Monocaprin (95% purity, 800 mg daily). Monocaprin is recognized as GRAS by US FDA.
Group 5: standard care + SLS (pharmaceutical grade, 100 mg/kg/day). SLS toxicity: lowest NOAEL (repeated dose, rat): 100 mg/kg/day (hepatotoxicity) (Bondi et al., 2015).

Family Court Shutdown due to Coronavirus Could Cause Termination of Parental Rights for Countless Families,"       

by Allie Parker
Health Impact News
Federal laws require states to initiate termination of parental rights when a child has been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months. With family courts shutting down across the country due to the Coronavirus outbreak, delaying reunification and adjudication hearings, could families face termination of their parental rights without due process?
Family Reunification on “Indefinite” Hold
In a story by Abigail Kramer for Center for New York City Affairs, March 30th, Kramer reports,
“Amid the chaos caused by Covid-19, New York City parents with kids in the child welfare system have lost access to the Family Court judges normally entrusted with protecting their rights.”
Kramer found,
“at least one case where the child welfare agency for New York City held custody of a child for more than a week without seeking permission from a judge, according to family members who were desperate to bring the child home.”
CPS must have a signed order by a judge in order to remove a child from their home, unless the agency feels a child is in imminent danger, at which time the agency can proceed with an “emergency removal.” The agency must then seek the approval of a judge on the following business day. At that time, the family is likely assigned an attorney or has already sought legal counsel to contest the removal and petition the court to return the child home. 
With the potential spread of COVID-19, family courts have closed or reduced caseloads. According to the report by Kramer, regarding a statement from the New York State Office of Court Administration, judges are holding hearings by phone and video, only on “essential/emergency” matters. The administration did not respond to the author’s request for further comments on their story.
Kramer states, according to attorneys who represent parents, judges are continuing to hear petitions from the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) seeking to remove children from their homes and place them in foster care, but they are not willing to hear motions by parents seeking to return children home.
The attorneys claim the results of this will be,
“Children may be held unnecessarily, away from parents who have little legal recourse or protection.”
Emma Ketteringham, managing director of the Family Defense Practice at The Bronx Defenders, is quoted in an email statement as stating,
“ACS continues to take children away from their parents. Yet the court has built a system where government power will go unchecked and children and parents have almost no ability to challenge their continued separation.
This approach denies Constitutional rights, does irreparable harm to the children the system claims to protect, and is a message to the world that the families in the child welfare system, the vast majority of whom are low-income and of color, are not ‘essential.”
If parents go to the Family Court building, they find a sign on the door offering phone numbers for people looking for an order of protection, but there is not contact information for child protection matters, reports Kramer.
The story continues by explaining how attorneys are left to rely on ACS to give them the parents’ phone numbers, “which often happens less than an hour before the agency files a motion with the virtual Family Court.” 
A hearing is then held over “Skype for Business.” The problem that now arises, according to Kramer, is, 
“Many families don’t have access to the necessary technology; attorneys say they’re resorting to holding cell phones up to computer speakers, through which parents strain to hear the decisions made about their children.”
ACS was unable to tell the reporter how many children have been removed from their homes since family courts lowered its caseloads in the wake of the coronavirus, but the agency does continue to request children in foster care be returned home.  
The story reports, according to an agency spokesperson, 
“If all parties agree to the return of a child or modification of any order, the parties email a signed stipulation and the judge will review it and schedule a hearing if necessary.”
Kramer claims, 
“ACS files new petitions in Family Court involving about 1,000 children each month.”
Family Court judges are tasked with overseeing dozens of hearings a day. These hearings, according to Kramer, “are necessary to move forward with ongoing cases,” but when the court dockets are already overbooked with hearings, the reporter claims, advocates are now worried the Courts will have an impossible backlog.  
This backlog would cause children currently in the foster care system to remain there for months, possibly years. Either way, children will be left in foster care longer than necessary. 
Lauren Shapiro, director of the Family Defense Practice at Brooklyn Defender Services, is quoted as saying,
“Hundreds of children are going to stay separated from their families indefinitely given these court delays, even though if a judge was to hear the facts of the case, they could probably go home to their families.”
The story claims,
“At least one child in Queens was kept for a week in the agency’s Children’s Center with no court oversight at all, according to family members.”
“The child” is reported to be 14-year-old Ruby, a severely autistic child who came into ACS custody when her mother was hospitalized in early January 2020, then transferred to a rehabilitation facility after suffering a stroke.  
Ruby was placed with her 24-year-old sister, but Ruby had, 
“frequent outbursts at school and home that resulted in emergency room visits and hospital stays.”
According to the report:
“(Ruby’s adult relatives requested anonymity for this story, but shared multiple documents from ACS that corroborate their account of the investigation and the child’s week-long placement in the Children’s Center.)
Throughout its two-month investigation, ACS agreed to let Ruby remain at home, under the care of her sister and an adult cousin who took her on weekends. The agency also said that it would seek services, such as a home health aide, to help the family cope until Ruby’s mother could return home. But those services never materialized. Instead, ACS picked Ruby up from a hospital stay on March 19th and brought her to the agency’s Children’s Center in Queens.”
The case was never brought to Family Court, which meant the family had no attorney. Ruby’s cousin is quoted as saying,
“It was horrible,” says Ruby’s cousin. “I would talk to her on the phone and she kept saying, ‘Come get me, I’ll be good, please come get me.”
Kramer reports that after a week, Ruby was finally released to her cousin’s home who is already caring for her own four children and a niece. With the closure of schools due to the coronavirus pandemic, all the children are home full-time.  
Ruby’s cousin is quoted as saying,
“Services are shut down because of the virus, so the caseworker said I’m pretty much on my own.”
“It’s a lot,” the cousin said. “I’m really not trained to give her the help she needs. But I was not going to leave her in the system.”
What about those families and children who don’t have a choice about being in the system?
November 19, 1997, Congress approved the “Adoption and Safe Families Act” (ASFA), which was signed into law by then president Bill Clinton.
ASFA marked a profound change to child welfare and the thinking surrounding it.  
One of the lead sponsors for ASFA, Republican Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, is quoted in a publication from November 1997, by Katharine Q. Seelye from The New York Times, as saying,
“We will not continue the current system of always putting the needs and rights of the biological parents first.”
The New York Times continued with other details about the legislation which include,
“The legislation also would provide cash bonuses to states that increase their adoptions, giving them $4,000 for each child adopted above the previous year’s number and $6,000 for each adoption of a child who is older or has some physical or emotional disability.”
Not only did the legislation allot cash incentives to states that obtain more adoptions, which would only be possible if more parents had their parental rights terminated, it made it easier for states to terminate the rights of parents whether they had the right to due process or not.
Section 103 (E) of ASFA states,
“In the case of a child who has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for 15 of the most recent 22 months, the State shall file a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child’s parents.”

With the overload of cases in the family courts already causing custody cases and hearings to go on for an average of 15-18 months, the new coronavirus pandemic delaying hearings is just cause for concern of any family dealing with CPS at this time.  
Children’s Bureau sends out letter urging courts and judges to preserve family time
March 27, 2020, the Federal Department of Health & Human Services, Children’s Bureau (CB), released a letter to Child Welfare Legal and Judicial Leaders which states the Children’s Bureau cannot waive statutorily required judicial proceedings, but expects courts and states work together to balance child-safety related requirements against public-health mandates.  
The letter also suggests courts use flexible means of convening required hearings.
Page three of the letter tells how the Bureau is,
“aware of instances where judges have issued blanket orders suspending or drastically reducing family time (visitation) between children in foster care and parents, sometimes indefinitely.  Family time is important for child and parent well-being, as well as for efforts toward reunification. Family time is especially important during times of crisis. CB strongly discourages the issuance of blanket orders that are not specific to each child and family that suspend family time; doing so is contrary to the well-being and best interest of children, may contribute to additional child trauma, and may impede the likelihood of reunification.”
The letter lists several ways in which all courts, Court Improvement Programs (CIPs), and administrative offices can preserve family time.
After all, 
“Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws” – Amendment 14 of the United States Constitution
