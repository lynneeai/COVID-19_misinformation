Coronavirus … Panic or Pandemic?,"Does anyone remember the words of FDR:  “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself”?
I wonder what he’d say today in light of the current state of PANIC over the coronavirus…
The coronavirus has absolutely dominated the news for the past couple of weeks. Travel has come to a standstill, states are forcing businesses to close, and some parts of the country are already under quarantine. Millions of people are out of work and panicked shoppers have left grocery store shelves bare.
Check out the photos that I took in our local grocery store yesterday. This was the bread aisle, but most of the other aisles were also barren.

If you’ve been to the grocery store lately, you’ve probably seen something similar. The impact on our social lives and the global economy has been massive, especially in the first few weeks of March. Major events have been postponed, thousands of businesses have been forced to close, and the stock markets have taken a major blow.
In an attempt to help slow the spread of the virus, health officials have asked people to practice “social distancing,” where we avoid group events and contact with one another as best we can. Several major sport leagues, including the NBA, MLB, NHL, and Champions League have postponed their seasons indefinitely. The NCAA basketball tournament known as March Madness was originally going to play the games without fans in attendance but has decided to scrap the tournament altogether.
More recently, state and local governments have issued emergency orders banning bars, restaurants, gyms, and other social gathering places from remaining open. Many of these went into effect at midnight on March 17th, dealing a huge blow to the hospitality industry just before St. Patrick’s Day.
In the midst of all that’s happening in the world, there is one underlying disease: FEAR.
People are panicking … begging the government to protect and save them.
But here’s the question few people seem to be asking…
“Do we have enough data to support the panic?”
In a recent article by John P.A. Ioannidis (professor of medicine, of epidemiology and population health, of biomedical data science, and of statistics at Stanford University), he made some good points…
The current coronavirus disease, Covid-19, has been called a once-in-a-century pandemic. But it may also be a once-in-a-century evidence fiasco. … The data collected so far on how many people are infected and how the epidemic is evolving are utterly unreliable. Given the limited testing to date, some deaths and probably the vast majority of infections due to SARS-CoV-2 are being missed. We don’t know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of three or 300. Three months after the outbreak emerged, most countries, including the U.S., lack the ability to test a large number of people and no countries have reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in a representative random sample of the general population.”
He continued:
In the absence of data, prepare-for-the-worst reasoning leads to extreme measures of social distancing and lockdowns. … If we decide to jump off the cliff, we need some data to inform us about the rationale of such an action and the chances of landing somewhere safe.”
Regardless of whether we have enough data or not, it seems like the mention of the “V” word is getting more and more frequent. Make no mistake… a coronavirus VACCINE is coming! Will it be “mandatory”?  Will anyone who refuses the vaccine be ostracized from society or be prohibited from traveling?
In a LA Times article from March 18th, they tell the story of Edward Jenner, crediting him with “saving the most lives ever” with the smallpox vaccine. Then they claim that the anti-vaxxers have “forgotten” about how successful the smallpox vaccine was.
According to the article:
This collective amnesia has allowed for the rise of the anti-vaccine movement, whose irresponsible adherents believe vaccines exist to line the pockets of Big Pharma. They ignore the fact that the smallpox vaccine was so overwhelmingly successful at eradicating the disease that it no longer is routinely given.  Are anti-vaxxers ready to start believing in vaccines again?
Please allow me to retort to this wildly inaccurate article…
Vaccinations became mandatory in England in 1853, and by 1857, fines and imprisonment awaited people who refused to be vaccinated against smallpox. And as Dr. Humphries just mentioned, once smallpox vaccination became mandatory in England, massive epidemics began to occur.  According to official figures of the Register General of England, between 1857 and 1859, there were over 14,000 deaths from smallpox. Then, between 1863 and 1865, there were over 20,000 smallpox deaths. A few years later, there were almost 45,000 smallpox deaths between 1870 and 1872.
Let’s just say that based on those death statistics, the smallpox vaccine was far from “overwhelmingly successful” as the article claims. I’d call that an abysmal failure!
According to Dr. Suzanne Humphries (in her book “Dissolving Illusions”) an interesting phenomenon occurred in a city called Leicester in England, which saw a massive outbreak of smallpox in 1871, despite an almost 100% vaccination rate. Over the next 15 years, the smallpox vaccine was mandatory and they continued to have outbreaks. However, on March 23, 1885, what became known as the “Great Demonstration” against mandatory vaccination took place in Leicester. The residents of Leicester were fed up and held a rally with over 80,000 people participating. They protested mandatory vaccines and actually won their freedom of choice. Over the next eight years, the vaccination rate went from approximately 95% to only 5%. During that period, if someone had smallpox, everyone in the “infected” house was placed in strict quarantine and the house thoroughly disinfected. And guess what happened! The death rates drastically decreased and there were no more outbreaks!
So the lessons we can learn from Leicester and smallpox is that the vaccine did NOT work, but actually CAUSED further outbreaks. Whereas quarantine and isolation were successful at mitigating the spread of disease.
And while quarantine and isolation are good ideas, what about FORCED quarantine and isolation?
Could that be considered “Medical Martial Law”?
More on that in a moment…
The Coming Coronavirus Vaccine
There are lots of promising, natural treatments available to help combat the virus, but nearly all global effort and funding has been dedicated to the development of a vaccine. In 2015, a patent was filed by The Pirbright Institute for the live, attenuated coronavirus. The application claims that the new virus could be used to create a vaccine for treating or preventing respiratory viruses. The patent was awarded in 2018.
Now, The Pirbright Institute is funded by the UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, the WHO, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. All of these entities have been loud supporters of mandatory vaccinations and more government control based on “health concerns.”
And for several years, Bill Gates has been telling us that a pandemic is coming, and in November of 2019, collaborating with the World Economic Forum, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation hosted “Event 201” where they ran a simulation of a coronavirus pandemic.
But the push for the vaccine has even the staunchest vaccine advocates and scientists worried.
“I understand the importance of accelerating timelines for vaccines in general, but from everything I know, this is not the vaccine to be doing it with,” Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told Reuters.
Hotez worked on development of a vaccine for SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the coronavirus behind a major 2003 outbreak, and found that some vaccinated animals developed more severe disease compared with unvaccinated animals when they were exposed to the virus.
“There is a risk of immune enhancement,” said Hotez. “The way you reduce that risk is first you show it does not occur in laboratory animals.”
The researchers at Pitt are even considering attaching the coronavirus to a genetically modified measles vaccine. Ummm….yeah…. that sounds like a “great idea.” (sarcasm intended)
But the vaccine won’t be available for at least a year, so in the meantime, we’re hearing some bizarre recommendations … like ….
“GET A FLU SHOT!”
We’re hearing the “doctors” on TV and major newspapers (like the New York Times) recommending that you should get a FLU vaccine to protect against Coronavirus.

But a 2017-2018 study published in the prestigious journal “Vaccine” (a peer-reviewed medical journal) revealed the following:
Examining non-influenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals (OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively)” 
In other words, the flu shot increases your risk of contracting coronavirus by 36%!

But What About Italy? 
A recent article in Bloomberg (titled “99% of Those Who Died From Virus Had Other Illness”) illustrates an overlooked variable in the “corona-panic” equation. And that variable would be the status of the immune system in those who are exposed.
The study found the following:
More than 99% of Italy’s coronavirus fatalities were people who suffered from previous medical conditions, according to a study by the country’s national health authority.”  
Moreover:
The Rome-based institute has examined medical records of about 18% of the country’s coronavirus fatalities, finding that just three victims, or 0.8% of the total, had no previous pathology. Almost half of the victims suffered from at least three prior illnesses and about a fourth had either one or two previous conditions. More than 75% had high blood pressure, about 35% had diabetes and a third suffered from heart disease.”
The Bloomberg article also pointed out that the primary threat is to the elderly (the average age of someone who died was 79.5) and that the fatality rate may have been significantly overblown. Rather than 8%, the fatality rate may, in fact, be closer to the global average of about 2%.
This new report challenges much of the global reporting on the topic which presents a unilateral narrative that simply being exposed (within six feet) to someone who may have tested positive for the virus is life-threatening, independent of one’s health status and other precautions one might take, such as supporting one’s immune system.  Elderly people, already taking multiple prescription drugs for chronic diseases, are highly susceptible to opportunistic infections due to their chronic conditions, the adverse effects of pharmaceuticals, and subsequently weakened immune systems.
Below is a table indicating the COVID-19 fatality rate by age.

As is evident, those who are younger than 60 years old have less than 1% chance of death if exposed.
What About the PCR Test?
According to David Crowe (a Canadian software and telecommunications engineer with a degree in biology who is an expert in global infections such as SARS, Ebola, and flu), the coronavirus panic is an irrational panic, based on an unproven RNA test called “polymerase chain reaction” (PCR).
In his own words:
The coronavirus test is based on PCR, a manufacturing technique. When used as a test it does not produce a positive/negative result, but simply the number of cycles required to detect genetic material. The division between positive and negative is an arbitrary number of cycles chosen by the testers. If positive means infected and negative means uninfected, then there are cases of people going from infected to uninfected and back to infected again in a couple of days.
In layman’s terms, Mr. Crowe suggests that since the PCR test looks for RNA, there is no proof that it detects a virus.  Furthermore, there is no proof that the virus causes disease. He asserts that the data is being interpreted to benefit the viral theory, and there is zero concern for false positive results. He concludes that medical papers are propaganda to increase panic.
He continues:
The world is suffering from a massive delusion based on the belief that a test for RNA is a test for a deadly new virus, a virus that has emerged from wild bats in China, supported by the western assumption that Chinese people will eat anything that moves. If the virus exists, then it should be possible to purify viral particles. From these particles RNA can be extracted and should match the RNA used in this test. Until this is done it is possible that the RNA comes from another source, which could be the cells of the patient, bacteria, fungi etc. There might be an association with elevated levels of RNA and illness, but that is not proof that the RNA is from a virus. Without purification and characterization of virus particles, it cannot be accepted that an RNA test is proof that a virus is present.
Mr. Crowe mentions “false positives” and there is a shocking new Chinese scientific paper that calculated the false positive rate for asymptomatic patients as … (wait for it) … 80%!! 
And here’s a scientific study published less than 2 weeks ago which shows just under 50% false positives!
So, is this really a pandemic, or are people panicking based on a test which is producing anywhere from 50% to 80% false positives?
Medical Martial Law?
In times of crisis, it’s not uncommon for citizens to willingly give up their rights in the name of “safety” and “the greater good.” The coronavirus scare is no exception. Around the world, tens of millions of people have been placed under quarantine.
Since the outbreak of the virus a few months ago, government officials have exercised unprecedented authority to monitor and detain citizens. The effort to control media coverage has reached a fevered pitch, and there doesn’t seem to be any sign that the nanny state is going anywhere.
The efforts to quarantine those suspected of carrying the coronavirus seem to have had little effect on its global transmission. Nevertheless, millions of people in China and around the world have been put on lock-down. These people are confined to their homes, ships, or temporary “quarantine zones” with no due process.
And although you may expect this kind of authoritarian response in communist China, the west is facing similar detention efforts.
In New York City, thousands of people are currently under quarantine. Although New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio claims that most of the quarantines are “voluntary,” many of them aren’t. We saw during the measles “epidemic” last year that Mayor de Blasio has no problem with violating the freedom of American citizens when he tried to force unvaccinated families to receive their shots.
Although New York Governor tried to assure reporters that there are no plans to quarantine New York City amid the coronavirus outbreak, Mayor de Blasio said in an interview on CNN that “We’re absolutely considering that. We’re going to look at all other options, but it could get to that for sure for the whole country.”
San Francisco has already implemented such a quarantine. Officials in six San Francisco Bay Area counties issued a sweeping shelter-in-place mandate Monday affecting nearly 7 million people, ordering residents to avoid any unnecessary travel by any method and only leave their homes for food, medicine and exercise.
“BUT IT’S AN EMERGENCY!”
The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times and under all circumstances.”   – Ex parte Milligan, U.S. Supreme Court (1866)
Today the “coronavirus-panic” gives government fuel and cover for its assaults on freedom and poses a question the government does not want to answer: If liberty can be taken away in times of crisis, then is it really liberty; or is it just a license, via a temporary government permission slip, subject to the whims of politicians in power?
The government has no authority to dictate how many people choose to congregate for any peaceful purpose.
Our First Amendment states:
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble.
Telling people to not attend church is a violation of the constitutional clause, “prohibiting the free exercise thereof.”
Telling people they cannot gather in groups of more than 20 or 30 (or whatever arbitrary number) is a clear violation of the constitutional clause, “no law . . . prohibiting . . . the right of the people peaceably to assemble.”
The coronavirus or any other “emergency” does NOT cancel or negate the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
We have far more to fear from “Big Government” tyranny than we do from any virus. Moreover, liberty is natural and personal. You can sacrifice yours, but you cannot sacrifice mine.
The Good News! 
There are natural ways to fight off viral infections and keep your immune system healthy, one of which is vitamin C, which is currently being used in China against COVID-19 coronavirus and has been officially recommended by the Shanghai government.
The coronavirus can be dramatically slowed, or stopped, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C. Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.
Is vitamin C a “cure” for coronavirus? The reality is that there is no “cure” for coronavirus (or any virus for that matter). We are exposed to literally thousands of ‘harmful’ viruses each and every day, but with a functioning immune system and intake of natural antivirals, we shouldn’t have to worry about any of the viruses … including coronavirus!
That’s why we are taking PuraThrive Liposomal Vitamin C each and every day. Why liposomal? Because it is the only route of administration that’s as “bioavailable” (absorbable) as IV injections, and it’s much cheaper and less invasive.

Want proof that vitamin C may be an answer? Anyone saying that vitamin therapy can stop coronavirus is already being labeled as “promoting false information” and promulgating “fake news.” Even the sharing of verifiable news, and direct quotes from credentialed medical professionals, is being restricted or blocked on social media.
Another supplement we take every day is iodine (specifically Detoxadine, formulated by Dr. Edward Group). Iodine exhibits activity against bacteria, molds, yeasts, protozoa, and many viruses. Interestingly, of all the antiseptic preparations suitable for direct use on humans and animals and upon tissues, only iodine is capable of killing all classes of pathogens (gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, yeasts, viruses and protozoa).

According to Dr. David Brownstein:
Iodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine.”
One of the main problems with coronavirus is that it creates a “cytokine storm,” which is induced by the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes.  According to a recent article from Italy, melatonin inhibits the NLRP3 inflammasome, so it may be a truly unique molecule to fight against COVID-19. Simply stated, adequate melatonin levels may reduce the infectiousness of coronavirus and may also diminish the chances of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury.
Also, silver has been utilized as a medicine since ancient times to treat scores of ailments, including the bubonic plague. It works by interfering with the enzymes that allow a virus to utilize oxygen thus, in essence, suffocating it so it cannot do damage in the body. Silver nanoparticles have proven to exert antiviral activity against HIV-1 at non-cytotoxic concentrations, but the mechanism underlying their HIV-inhibitory activity has not been not fully elucidated. In this study, silver nanoparticles are evaluated to elucidate their mode of antiviral action against HIV-1 using a panel of different in vitro assays.
Interestingly, a little over 100 years ago, during the infamous Spanish flu epidemic of 1918-19, it has been estimated that 50 million people died worldwide. In the USA alone, 550,000 people died, which was approximately 10% of the people afflicted with the flu. Homeopathic physicians documented then more than 62,000 patients treated with homeopathy resulting in a mortality of 0.7%. For people who were sick enough to be hospitalized, conventional medicine had a mortality of 30% while with 27,000 documented hospitalized cases, homeopathy was reporting a mortality of 1.05% (Journal of the American Institute of Homeopathy 1921; 13:1028-43).
Remember … when it comes to the coronavirus (or any other bacteria or virus for that matter) …
Don’t worry … BE HEALTHY!

7 Benefits of Vitamin C,"Growing up, we always had a bottle of vitamin C on the kitchen table, conveniently found on the “lazy Susan.” As I remember, they were chewable, orange-flavored tablets and they were yummy! Taking one with breakfast, along with a multivitamin with minerals was just part of the Bollinger family’s morning routine at breakfast.
Vitamin C is an essential vitamin, meaning your body can’t produce it.
It’s an antioxidant and confers the following benefits (among many others):
Helps maintain your skin, bones, and connective tissue
Promotes wound healing
Helps with high blood pressure
Lowers risk of heart disease
Strengthens immunity
Helps the body absorb iron
Potent anti-viral activity.
When we are challenged with a viral infection, our need for vitamin C can rise dramatically, depending on the body’s immune function, level of injury, infection, or environmental toxicity. Vitamin C has been shown to be one of the most potent anti-viral agents, especially to influenza virus, through increased production of IFN-α/β. It can also enhance the production of interferon, which helps prevent cells from being infected by a virus.
Interestingly, three research studies in China have approved vitamin C for treating coronavirus (COVID-19). Confirmation has also been obtained that 50 TONS of vitamin C has been shipped to Wuhan province, and on March 3rd, the Shanghai government officially recommended Vitamin C for COVID-19.
There’s little doubt that vitamin C is of great benefit to the human body. However, how you consume vitamin C makes a huge difference in the amount your body is able to absorb and use (a feature of all supplements called “bioavailability”).
When taken orally, most of the vitamin C you take (either from food or supplements) isn’t absorbed by the gut. However, liposomal vitamin C is a groundbreaking option for high-dose vitamin C that is the closest thing to “intravenous vitamin C.”
Being wrapped in essential phospholipids, vitamin C is absorbed like dietary fats. This being so, liposomal vitamin C is much better absorbed than traditional vitamin C supplements.
As a matter of fact, liposomal vitamin C is almost as “bioavailable” (absorbable) as IV injections, and it’s much cheaper, more convenient and less invasive.

Man-Made Coronavirus Kills Hundreds (Bill Gates has a Vaccine for That),"It’s been 2 weeks since we first wrote about the novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) originating in China. Since then, the official numbers have skyrocketed from 630 infections and 17 deaths to over 24,000 infections and roughly 500 deaths.
NaturalNews reports that China is actually keeping two sets of numbers, and that the actual numbers are much higher than the “official” numbers, with over 154,000 infected and almost 25,000 dead. Several nations have evacuated their citizens from china, while airlines have shut down flights to China and other countries.
On January 31st, President Trump declared that the novel coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States. That same day, under the guidance of the CDC, the White House Coronavirus Task Force announced a 14-day quarantine for Americans who recently visited Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
Over the last two weeks, the Chinese government has quarantined roughly 50 million people in over a dozen cities – the largest quarantine in human history. Cruise liners carrying infected passengers have been denied entry into Japan and passengers will be quarantined on the ships for at least two weeks.
Major manufacturers like Apple and Adidas have shut down their stores and plants in China, and airlines have placed over 30,000 employees on unpaid leave. In the U.S., hundreds of Americans have been evacuated from the Wuhan area and will be immediately quarantined on military bases.
The measures being taken by governments around the world are drastic and unprecedented. The authority that these institutions are willing to assume in the face of a “health emergency” is concerning… and it’s only the beginning.
Social Media Increases Censorship
In the wake of the new virus, Facebook announced that it would remove any content about the coronavirus “with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities,” saying such content would violate its ban on misinformation leading to “physical harm.”
This is a much more aggressive policy than Facebook has taken before. Up to this point, censorship efforts have mostly involved restricting search results and advertising while still allowing the content to remain published. The ban will also apply to Instagram, which will subject users to pop-up ads when they click on hashtags related to the virus.
Google has followed suit, pushing updates from the WHO to the top of search results involving the coronavirus. YouTube, owned by Google, will also make it harder to find independent information about the virus, promoting videos from public health organizations and mainstream media outlets.
Twitter said Wednesday that it would begin prompting users who search for the coronavirus to first visit official channels of information about the illness. In the United States, for example, Twitter directs users to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, beneath a bold headline that reads: “Know the facts.”
The campaign is running in 15 locations, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia, and “will continue to expand as the need arises,” the company said in a blog post.

Twitter has even banned financial market website Zero Hedge from the social media platform after it published an article linking a Chinese scientist to the outbreak of the fast-spreading coronavirus last week.
Zero Hedge had their account permanently suspended for violating “platform manipulation policy”. The account had 670,000 followers as of its suspension. The suspension was in response to a complaint by Buzzfeed which said Zero Hedge had released the personal information of a scientist from Wuhan in an article that made allegations about coronavirus having been concocted “as a bioweapon.” The article was titled “Is This the Man Behind the Global Coronavirus Pandemic?”
Tik-Tok, a Chinese-owned company, already removes posts and blocks users. This is standard practice in communist China, where state-run media and extreme surveillance of its citizens makes it easy to control what information is released.
The Digital Police State
The effort in China to silence free speech and control the narrative regarding coronavirus has been aggressive. According to a Reuters report:
At least 16 people have been arrested over coronavirus posts in Malaysia, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Hong Kong, while Singapore has used its controversial new “fake news” law, POFMA, to force media outlets and social media users to carry government warnings on their posts and articles saying they contain falsehoods.
“Fortunately, we now have POFMA to deal with this fake news,” said Lawrence Wong, one of the ministers heading a Singapore government task force to halt the spread of the virus.
At least five people were arrested and released on bail in India’s southwestern state of Kerala over WhatsApp messages, said Aadhithya R, District Police Chief of Thrissur. Six people were arrested in Malaysia on suspicion of spreading false news.
In Vietnam, where an army of cyber-censors tracks social media comments for the communist government, at least nine people have been fined and three celebrities asked to explain their actions over posts about coronavirus.
Thailand hailed the success of an “anti-fake news centre” it set up last year. Dozens of staff reviewed nearly 7,600 posts in four days from Jan. 25 – leading to 22 posts being highlighted as false on its website and two arrests under computer crimes laws.
“The anti-fake news centre is working intensively to verify these rumours and communicating truth to the people,” said Digital Minister Puttipong Punnakanta.
To make matters worse, it turns out that Chinese officials arrested 8 medical professionals who tried to warn people of the disease back in December. Each detainee was part of a medical school’s alumni group on WeChat, a popular social network in China, and they were concerned that SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, was back. (SARS is a type of coronavirus.)
According to The Daily Beast:
It wasn’t long before police detained them. The authorities said these eight doctors and medical technicians were “misinforming” the public, that there was no SARS, that the information was obviously wrong, and that everyone in the city must remain calm. On the first day of 2020, Wuhan police said they had “taken legal measures” against the eight individuals who had “spread rumors.”
Since then, the phenomenal spread of the virus has created cracks even within the normally united front of the Chinese Communist Party. “It might have been fortunate if the public had believed the ‘rumor’ and started to wear masks, carry out sanitization measures, and avoid the wild animal market,” a judge of China’s Supreme People’s Court wrote online last Tuesday.
Li Wenliang, a doctor who was among the eight people who tried to sound the alarm before the coronavirus infected many thousands and killed hundreds, was diagnosed as someone infected with the coronavirus and is being treated at a hospital. Authorities are still actively censoring social-media posts and news articles that question the government’s response to the outbreak. One Wuhan man, Fang Bin, uploaded footage of corpses in a van and a hospital in Wuhan and was then tracked down and taken into custody. His laptop was confiscated, and he had to pedal for three hours on a bicycle to get home after he was questioned, warned, and released. His coronavirus video went viral.
Experts agree that this kind of aggressive censorship could make the virus even more lethal. Leaders within the Chinese government have put their political interests before the good of their people, and the results have been catastrophic thus far.
In recent days, medical experts have found evidence that the origin of the outbreak was not a seafood market in Wuhan, as the Chinese government initially reported. That evidence also suggests that the first human infections occurred in November, if not earlier, rather than in early December.
The true scope of the disease may be worse than we’ve been told. Public officials have been deleting investigative reports by journalists in the area, while many patients who have died of “regular pneumonia” were never tested for coronavirus.
Given the rapid spread of the virus and the enormous economic effects expected, censorship and propaganda are certain to continue — and to extend beyond China’s borders — as the regime seeks to protect its hold on power and international reputation. While Chinese authorities assure domestic and international audiences that their efforts will contain the outbreak, censors are busily deleting social media posts and journalists’ reporting that contradict the official narrative.
An International Conspiracy
Lies and secrecy are common in most communist nations, and China is no exception. It is well-documented that the information released during the SARS outbreak of 2003 was significantly redacted to minimize its true impact.
But what about here in America?
We’ve already reported that, in 2015, a patent was filed by The Pirbright Institute for the live, attenuated coronavirus. The application claims that the new virus could be used to create a vaccine for treating or preventing respiratory viruses. The patent was awarded in 2018.
The Pirbright Institute is funded by the UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, the WHO, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. All of these entities have been loud supporters of mandatory vaccinations and more government control based on “health concerns.”
And for several years, Bill Gates has been telling us that a pandemic is coming, and in November of 2019, collaborating with the World Economic Forum, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation hosted “Event 201” where they ran a simulation of a coronavirus pandemic.
It should come as no surprise that – just yesterday – Bill and Melinda Gates announced that they would be donating $100 million to coronavirus vaccine research and treatment efforts, which were announced as part of the World Health Organization’s (WHO) request for $675 million in global contributions to fight the spread of the disease.
You can bet your bottom dollar that this vaccine will be heavily pushed on all Americans, and probably mandated in some states and cities. But what’s the truth behind the coronavirus?
The Truth About Coronavirus
Officials would have you believe that the new coronavirus began when someone ate contaminated bat soup at a Wuhan seafood and animal market, but that is a flat-out lie. And a paper published in The Lancet last week has the proof.
The paper, written by a large group of Chinese researchers from several institutions, offers details about the first 41 hospitalized patients who had confirmed infections with what has been dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In the earliest case, the patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no reported link to the seafood market, the authors report.
“No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases,” they state. Their data also show that, in total, 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace. “That’s a big number, 13, with no link,” says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University.
Lucey says if the new data are accurate, the first human infections must have occurred in November 2019—if not earlier—because there is an incubation time between infection and symptoms surfacing. If so, the virus possibly spread silently between people in Wuhan—and perhaps elsewhere—before the cluster of cases from the city’s now-infamous Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was discovered in late December. “The virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace,” Lucey asserts.
The much more likely scenario is that a weaponized version of the virus was released (whether intentionally or not) by Wuhan’s Institute of Virology – a level-4 biohazard lab which was studying “the world’s most dangerous pathogens.”
The institute even has an ad for researchers to help use “bats to research the molecular mechanism that allows Ebola and SARS-associated coronaviruses to lie dormant for a long time without causing diseases.”
The job is for a lab run by Dr. Peng Zhou, Ph.D., a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and Leader of the Bat Virus Infection and Immunization Group. Since 2009, Peng has been the leading Chinese scientist researching the immune mechanism of bats carrying and transmitting lethal viruses in the world.
His primary field of study is researching how and why bats can be infected with some of the most nightmarish viruses in the world including Ebola, SARS and Coronavirus, and not get sick. As part of his studies, Peng also researched mutant Coronavirus strains that overcame the natural immunity of some bats; these are “superbug” Coronavirus strains, which are not resistant to any natural immune pathway, and now appear to be out in the wild.
The institute is about 13 miles away from the market that China claims as the source of the outbreak.
A study by 5 Greek scientists (published 1/27/2020) examined the genetic relationships of nCoV-2019 and found that “the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus,” and has an unusual middle segment never seen before in any coronavirus.
What exactly does that mean?  Basically, this means that we are dealing with a brand new type of ‘man-made’ coronavirus. The study’s authors rejected the original hypothesis that the virus originated from random natural mutations between different coronaviruses.
Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biological warfare, has also linked the virus to China’s covert biological weapons program. Mr. Shoham holds a doctorate in medical microbiology. From 1970 to 1991, he was a senior analyst with Israeli military intelligence for biological and chemical warfare in the Middle East and worldwide.
“Certain laboratories in the institute have probably been engaged, in terms of research and development, in Chinese [biological weapons], at least collaterally, yet not as a principal facility of the Chinese BW alignment,” Mr. Shoham told The Washington Times. Work on biological weapons is conducted as part of dual civilian-military research and is “definitely covert,” he said.
In a sad turn of events, the Chinese doctor who tried to warn others about the Wuhan coronavirus, has died. Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old doctor working in Wuhan, raised the alarm about the novel coronavirus on December 30th. Soon after he posted the message, Li was accused of rumor-mongering by the Wuhan police. He was one of several medics targeted by police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly virus in the early weeks of the outbreak. Li was hospitalized on January 12th after contracted the virus from one of his patients, and he was confirmed to have nCoV-2019 on February 1st.
The question is … If the Chinese made this virus in a lab, what was their purpose? And why did they arrest the doctor who tried to inform the rest of the world?
The world needs an answer.
Wolves in Sheep’s Clothing
As long as we continue to believe the lies promulgated by communist state-run media, we’re going to stay in the dark. Government agencies around the world have been happy to sensationalize the virus as an excuse for extreme control over their citizens.
People are being detained and quarantined. Travel and business have been seriously disrupted. The global economy is in turmoil. Scientists and journalists are being silenced and even arrested. And social media companies founded in the freest country on earth are deleting any content that suggests that this is a man-made problem.
People are scared. Tens of millions have had their lives put on hold. Hundreds have died in the last week.
But don’t worry… be healthy! There are herbs and natural substances that can have a profound effect on viruses and your immune function.
Surprise surprise!  Bill Gates, the WHO, and everyone else in the medical industry are working on a nCoV-2019 vaccine … a vaccine that they patented half a decade before the virus appeared … a virus that was created in a lab.
But that’s just a “coincidence,” right?
Here’s another incredible “coincidence” …
For several years, Bill Gates has been telling us that a pandemic is coming, and on October 18, 2019 (collaborating with the World Economic Forum), the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation hosted “Event 201” where they ran a simulation of a coronavirus pandemic.
A meeting of the “globalist health minds” occurred on November 6th to discuss its findings with 9 recommendations.
Surprise surprise!  One recommendation, of course, included deleting/erasing/censoring “disinformation” in the WHO’s eyes.
But that’s just another “coincidence,” right?

National Health Emergency Declared,"Today (Friday, Jan. 31, 2020), President Trump declared that the novel coronavirus presents a public health emergency in the United States. Also yesterday, under the guidance of the CDC, the White House Coronavirus Task Force announced a 14-day quarantine for Americans who recently visited Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. This will begin at 5pm ET tomorrow (Sunday). The 195 evacuated Americans (including a group of U.S. government workers and private citizens) will remain at a military base in Southern California until mid-February.
The U.S. government has not issued a quarantine like this in over 50 years.
On Thursday, the W.H.O. declared that the coronavirus is a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” (PHEIC).
India has reported its first case.
Russia has closed part of its border with China, and more than 7,700 cases have been reported, with 170 deaths.
Things seem to be ratcheting up!
What Is a Coronavirus (CoV)?
The name “coronavirus” comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope.
Coronavirus is transmitted through the air and primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. Though most of the members of the coronavirus family only cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can infect both upper and lower airways and cause severe respiratory illness and other complications in humans.
It has yet been determined whether the latest coronavirus is as lethal as SARS. SARS is another outbreak that began in China in 2002, infecting people through 2004. More than 700 people died worldwide of SARS.
This new coronavirus (nCoV-2019) causes similar symptoms to SARS and MERS. People infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response. Both SARS and MERS are classified as “zoonotic” viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. Now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person.
Here’s a very technical article written by James Lyons-Weiler which suggests that the nCoV-2019 is likely a human modified virus which the Chinese created using SARS spike glycoprotein.
DON’T WORRY… BE HEALTHY!
But it’s not time to fret or worry. It’s time to become educated about this outbreak. And it’s time to make sure you are doing everything you can to get and stay healthy, as the most likely people to suffer the most are those who are already immune compromised.
Also, research over the past two decades shows that certain herbal medicines and plants can fight the new Wuhan coronavirus contagion.
Sayer Ji recently published an article written by Dr. Case Adams about plants that have been shown to inhibit coronavirus, so here is the list:
Amaryllis (Hippeastrum hybrid)
Snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis)
Daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus)
Red spider lily (Lycoris radiate)
Leek (Allium porrum)
Ramsons (Allium ursinum)
Taro (Colocasia esculenta)
Cymbidium orchid (Cymbidium hybrid)
Twayblade (Listera ovata)
Broad-leaved helleborine (Epipactis helleborine)
Tulip (Tulipa hybrid)
Black mulberry tree (Morus Nigra)
Tobacco plant (Nicotiana tabacum)
Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica)
Other Possible Remedies
Recently, a novel antiviral compound (K22) that inhibits replication of a broad range of animal and human coronaviruses was reported to interfere with viral RNA synthesis by impairing double-membrane vesicle (DMV) formation.
Silver has been utilized as a medicine since ancient times to treat scores of ailments, including the bubonic plague. It works by interfering with the enzymes that allow a virus to utilize oxygen thus, in essence, suffocating it so it cannot do damage in the body. Silver nanoparticles have proven to exert antiviral activity against HIV-1 at non-cytotoxic concentrations, but the mechanism underlying their HIV-inhibitory activity has not been not fully elucidated. In this study, silver nanoparticles are evaluated to elucidate their mode of antiviral action against HIV-1 using a panel of different in vitro assays.
An extract from red algae (called “Griffithsin”) can fight SARS and MERS infections. Griffithsin contains mannose-binding lectins, which have been shown to penetrate and break down the shells that surround this class of viruses – which includes nCoV-2019 virus.
According to Sayer Ji,
Griffithsin is “not the only species of red algae that contains mannose-binding lectins. Another mannose-binding lectin found to be antiviral against these viruses is the Scytonema varium red algae, also called Scytovirin. Another one was found in the Nostoc ellipsosporum algae species – called Cyanovirin-N. A 2019 study from France’s Institut de Recherche et Développement tested a number of other species, and found the Ulva pertusa algae species contained lectins that fight these viruses. They also found the Oscillatoria agardhii blue-green algae halt replication of these viruses.”
Also, licorice root has been used for thousands of years for lung infections with similar symptoms as viral infection, and has been shown to be effective at reducing MERS and SARS replication.
Lastly, several types of essential oils have been shown to possess antiviral effects, including eucalyptus, clove, grapefruit, cinnamon leaf, tea tree, and lemon balm.

20 Million Quarantined as “Deadly” Coronavirus Reaches the U.S.,"In the wake of a new respiratory virus, Chinese authorities have shut down at least 5 cities, impacting tens of millions of people. The coronavirus, which first appeared only a month ago, has infected more than 630 people and is responsible for at least 17 deaths so far. The World Health Organization (WHO) is expected to declare a global health emergency sometime today.
The virus is believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan – home to 11 million people and a major port of travel. According to air traffic data collected by The New York Times, about 30,000 people fly out of Wuhan on an average day.
This weekend is also the Lunar New Year holiday, for which Chinese citizens typically travel in greater numbers. But as reports of the virus have spread to Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Japan, and the U.S., severe travel restrictions have left the city in an implied quarantine.
In addition to Wuhang’s 11 million residents, the neighboring city of Huanggang – home to 7 million – has also been placed on lockdown. By the end of the day, authorities also plan to suspend travel from the cities of Ezhou, Chibi, and Zhijang, home to about 2 million combined citizens.
Schools have canceled events and the capital canceled two of the nation’s largest Lunar New Year temple fairs. Airports around the world are conducting additional screening, and hundreds of millions of holiday travelers have been affected.
A government statement said that residents of the quarantined cities would not be allowed to leave without special permission.
The shut down of Wuhang alone is record-breaking. “The lockdown of 11 million people is unprecedented in public health history,” said Gauden Galea, the WHO’s Beijing representative.
The Chinese government is attempting to quarantine roughly 25 million people – more than the entire population of Florida.
But health officials feel these are necessary steps, fearing that the transmission rate will accelerate with the holiday travel. The coronavirus seems to have an extended incubation period, which means there could be many people carrying and transmitting the virus before they begin to show any symptoms.
Neil Ferguson, a professor at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, says that there are substantially more cases than have been confirmed so far. Based on the 5-6 day incubation period and 4-5 day delay from the start of symptoms to a diagnosis, the true number of people infected could be over 20,000.
The quarantine is not limited to China, as the first confirmed patient in the U.S. remains in isolation. He arrived in Seattle just over a week ago after traveling to China. After suffering from breathing difficulty and fever, he reached out to doctors and has been trapped at the hospital ever since.
He is not allowed to leave.
Coronavirus Spreads to the States
Just a few hours before publishing this article, another man arrived at LAX who is suspected of carrying the virus. Arriving on a flight from Mexico City, he was hospitalized and isolated for a precautionary evaluation.
Barbara Ferrer, director of the Department of Public Health, said there have been an average of 40 to 60 passengers daily arriving at LAX from the Wuhan area since the health screenings began. So far, none have been flagged for additional testing.
We are told that this outbreak could be massive. From The Washington Post:
A bigger outbreak is certain,” said Guan Yi, a virologist who helped identify severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003. He estimated — “conservatively,” he said — that this outbreak could be 10 times bigger than the SARS epidemic because that virus was transmitted by only a few “super spreaders” in a more defined part of the country.
We have passed through the ‘golden period’ for prevention and control,” he told Caixin magazine from self-imposed quarantine after visiting Wuhan. “What’s more, we’ve got the holiday traffic rush and a dereliction of duty from certain officials.”
Several U.S. airports are now screening passengers, and a middle school in Virginia has cancelled its Chinese exchange student program. The Chinese students landed at John F. Kennedy airport yesterday (one of the airports conducting “enhanced health screenings” – and were told in a letter that they would not be attending the school.)
Instead, they will be heading to Washington, D.C. to participate in “cultural and educational activities.”
Although experts believe the virus originated from animals, it is now transferable from human to human. Most coronaviruses cause mild symptoms such as the common cold that patients easily recover from. Other strains of the virus – such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) – can cause pneumonia and possible death.
SARS killed 770 of 8,000 people infected in 2002-2003. MERS killed about three or four out of every 10 people infected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said. Human coronaviruses are passed through coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, touching objects with the virus on it and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes before washing your hands.
Because this new disease is viral, antibiotics would not be a viable option for treatment. However, nebulizing silver may be an effective remedy, as well as essential oils and chlorine dioxide.
“Millions Could Die”?
Over the past couple of decades, we’ve seen lots of “possibly deadly” viruses unleashed …
“Watch out for Swine Flu!”
“SARS pandemic coming!”
“Ebola could wipe out humanity!” 
“This could be the big one and millions could die.” 
But then they didn’t …
I’m not saying this is the case with the coronavirus, because it certainly could be deadly, and it appears that it may have been “bioengineered” and possibly weaponized. I’m just saying that we need to remember that fear makes people do things that they may not normally do otherwise … like accepting a “coronavirus vaccination.”
According to Jon Rappoport:
Epidemics are good for business. Pharmaceutical business, inducing fear business, shutting down travel business, diverting the public from key events business, surveillance and quarantine business, and so on.”
Freedom? Forget it. Public safety is the ace in the deck. It wins every time. Hell, we may need a good epidemic in the US, so we can exert more control over the unruly citizenry. The doctor is king. Do what he says. Always. How many vaccines are there now? Take all of them. Everyone must.”
Look what we’ve seen in the USA! An “outbreak” of measles that resulted in zero fatalities, massive abuse of power, and legislation that flies in the face of our constitutional freedom.
New York City tried to force families to receive vaccines or be fined. Electronic health records have been used to hunt down families who aren’t vaccinated. Religious and personal exemptions are being stripped away at a rapid pace. Even doctors have been forced to surrender medical decisions to the government.
We’ve seen the government strip children away from their parents and force them to receive chemotherapy. We’ve seen new laws that would allow doctors to vaccinate children without their parents’ consent or knowledge. How long before Child Protective Services comes knocking on your door asking to see your child’s vaccination records?
Coronavirus Patent & Vaccine
In 2015, a patent was filed by The Pirbright Institute for the live, attenuated coronavirus. The application claims that the new virus could be used to create a vaccine for treating or preventing respiratory viruses. The patent was awarded in 2018.
Now, The Pirbright Institute is funded by the UK Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, the WHO, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. All of these entities have been loud supporters of mandatory vaccinations and more government control based on “health concerns.”
And for several years, Bill Gates has been telling us that a pandemic is coming, and in November of 2019, collaborating with the World Economic Forum, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation hosted “Event 201” where they ran a simulation of a coronavirus pandemic.
Interesting…
Don’t tell me, let me guess … Bill Gates just happens to have a vaccine all ready for this coronavirus outbreak, right?
The Bottom Line
Please be vigilant and stay tuned for updates. This type of virus could be extremely dangerous given how long it takes to incubate and its ability to mutate and form new versions of itself. So-called “experts” have said that this could be 10 times worse than the SARS outbreak earlier this century. China is attempting the largest single quarantine in history.
About 10 months ago, I wrote an article about the pending medical tyranny. Sadly, many of my concerns have already come to fruition. These changes are happening everyday RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES. And mark my words:
The coronavirus will pave the way for new legislation and new attacks on our freedom.
You’ve heard about frogs and boiling water? If you drop a frog into a pot of boiling water, he will quickly hop out and save himself. But if you place the frog in lukewarm water, slowly turning up the temperature one degree at a time, the frog will acclimate until he is boiled alive.
Don’t be a frog.
The temperature has been increasing for years now, and it’s time to get out of the pot. No matter how this disease started or how far it spreads, I can promise you that someone will find a way to profit, and we will soon see legislation and emergency measures that trample on our freedom of speech, freedom to choose our medical care, and freedom to make decisions for our children.

"Coronavirus: Detention, the Demise of Freedom, the Perils of 5G & Personal Protection","(PLEASE SHARE THIS ARTICLE WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY)
The World Health Organization has declared a pandemic, as the global infection count stemming from the coronavirus has now exceeded 137,000 and has been attributed to over 5,000 deaths worldwide. More and more countries are facing outbreaks as governments scramble to contain its spread and find a cure. But what if there’s more to this virus than meets the eye? What if the deadly virus that has spread to 100 countries has a more sinister origin?
Government Tracking and Control
Since the outbreak of the virus in Wuhan, China, government officials have exercised unprecedented authority to monitor and detain citizens. The effort to control media coverage has reached a fevered pitch, and there doesn’t seem to be any sign that the nanny state is going anywhere.
Media Censorship
Tech companies have stepped up the effort to control the narrative, and basic freedom of speech is at stake. Even worse, efforts by the Chinese government to silence citizens and news outlets may have played a role in the spread of this virus.
Chinese officials arrested 8 medical professionals who tried to warn people of the disease back in December. Each detainee was part of a medical school’s alumni group on WeChat, a popular social network in China, and they were concerned that SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, was back. (SARS is a type of coronavirus.)
According to The Daily Beast, it wasn’t long before police detained them. The authorities said these eight doctors and medical technicians were “misinforming” the public, that there was no SARS, that the information was obviously wrong, and that everyone in the city must remain calm. On the first day of 2020, Wuhan police said they had “taken legal measures” against the eight individuals who had “spread rumors.”
Since then, the phenomenal spread of the virus has created cracks even within the normally united front of the Chinese Communist Party. “It might have been fortunate if the public had believed the ‘rumor’ and started to wear masks, carry out sanitation measures, and avoid the wild animal market,” a judge of China’s Supreme People’s Court wrote online last Tuesday.
Li Wenliang, a doctor who was among the eight people who tried to sound the alarm before the coronavirus infected many thousands and killed hundreds, was diagnosed as someone infected with the coronavirus and has since died. Authorities are still actively censoring social-media posts and news articles that question the government’s response to the outbreak.
One Wuhan man, Fang Bin, uploaded footage of corpses in a van and a hospital in Wuhan and was then tracked down and taken into custody. His laptop was confiscated, and he had to pedal for three hours on a bicycle to get home after he was questioned, warned, and released. His coronavirus video went viral.
Experts agree that this kind of aggressive censorship could make the virus even more lethal. Leaders within the Chinese government have put their political interests before the good of their people, and the results have been catastrophic thus far.
Videos of workers soaking entire cities in bleach have been quietly removed or hidden on social platforms, and leaked footage of police training to “capture” a suspected patient have resulted in the poster’s arrest.

In recent days, medical experts have found evidence that the origin of the outbreak was not a seafood market in Wuhan, as the Chinese government initially reported. That evidence also suggests that the first human infections occurred in November, if not earlier, rather than in early December.
Mandatory Quarantine or Illegal Detention?
The efforts to quarantine those suspected of carrying the coronavirus seem to have had little effect on its global transmission. Nevertheless, millions of people in China and around the world have been put on lock-down. These people are confined to their homes, ships, or temporary “quarantine zones” with no due process.
And although you may expect this kind of authoritarian response in communist China, the west is facing similar detention efforts.
In New York City, over 2,700 people are currently under quarantine. Although New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio claims that most of the quarantines are “voluntary,” many of them aren’t. We saw during the measles “epidemic” last year that Mayor de Blasio has no problem with violating the freedom of American citizens when he tried to force unvaccinated families to receive their shots.
The U.S. government is detaining many travelers at military bases for up to 14 days… whether they like it or not. On January 29, a flight carrying nearly 200 Americans from Wuhan landed at the March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California. The evacuees were placed under a 14-day quarantine in the base’s living quarters. None of them tested positive for the virus, and the evacuees were released.
On a Princess cruise ship, thousands of passengers were confined to their cabins for nearly a month. Many passengers were trapped in windowless cabins totaling about 150 square feet (about 3 times larger than a prison cell). By the end of the failed quarantine, hundreds of passengers had been infected. Six of them died.
In Australia, things may be even worse. After the first human-to-human transmission of the novel coronavirus in Australia, the federal attorney general has made clear the government already has powers to detain people – against their will if necessary – to prevent the spread of the virus.
Under changes made to the Biosecurity Act in 2015, government authorities designated by the chief medical officer can make a “human biosecurity control order” to require an individual to do or not do certain things, including:
Provide contact details
Regularly update an officer of their health status
Restrict movement by remaining at the individual’s place of residence for a specified period
Undergo decontamination
Provide body samples for diagnosis
Undertake treatment or receive a vaccination
To remain in Australia for up to 28 days
Be isolated at a medical facility
An individual must comply with an isolation measure or a traveler movement measure for the first 72 hours while a direction is being sought. If an individual refuses to comply with a requirement to stay at a particular place or isolate themselves, there is a power for police to detain them.
On Tuesday the attorney general, Christian Porter, said it is “not inconceivable” that control orders could lead to detention if individuals refused control orders, but this was intended as a “last resort.”
He suggested the powers were most likely to be used to require people visiting sick relatives to undergo decontamination, to prevent them entering or exiting a medical clinic, or to answer questions at a hospital in the same way they do when entering or exiting Australia.
In addition to control orders, there are powers for the health minister enlivened by emergencies involving threats or harm to human health on a nationally significant scale, called human ‘biosecurity’ emergencies.
These powers allow the minister to “determine any requirement that he or she is satisfied is necessary” to prevent entry or spread of a disease.
They are subject to safeguards that the requirement must be “likely to be effective”, is “appropriate and adapted” to its purpose and is “no more restrictive or intrusive than is required in the circumstances”.
Offenses for failing to comply are punishable by five years in prison or 300 penalty units (about $63,000, indexed to inflation); the same penalties apply to failure to comply with a control order.
The Chinese Surveillance State
Chinese have long been aware that they are tracked by the world’s most sophisticated system of electronic surveillance. The coronavirus emergency has brought some of that technology out of the shadows, providing the authorities with a justification for sweeping methods of high-tech social control.
Artificial intelligence and security camera companies boast that their systems can scan the streets for people with even low-grade fevers, recognize their faces even if they are wearing masks and report them to the authorities.
If a coronavirus patient boards a train, the railway’s “real name” system can provide a list of people sitting nearby.
Mobile phone apps can tell users if they have been on a flight or a train with a known coronavirus carrier, and maps can show them locations of buildings where infected patients live.
Although there has been some anonymous grumbling on social media, for now Chinese citizens seem to be accepting the extra intrusion, or even embracing it, as a means to combat the health emergency.
“In the circumstances, individuals are likely to consider this to be reasonable even if they are not specifically informed about it,” said Carolyn Bigg, partner at law firm DLA Piper in Hong Kong.
This rollout of the world’s most sophisticated surveillance network should alarm you. Sure, it seems like a great way to help contain the virus and identify people who may have been exposed, but at what cost? This system wasn’t built in response to the virus – it already existed. Now that the government has an excuse, they’re finally able to flex their technology muscles.
The new reality in China (and around the world) is that we are constantly being watched, tracked, and listened to. Our devices are capable of marking our exact location, listening in on our conversations, and even transmitting video feeds. The age of privacy has come to an end, and the age of government tracking is upon us.
But cameras and GPS tracking aren’t the only tools that are being deployed.
Coronavirus and 5G
It’s first important to know that the coronavirus did not originate from a bad batch of bat soup at a local market.
The paper, written by a large group of Chinese researchers from several institutions, offers details about the first 41 hospitalized patients who had confirmed infections with what has been dubbed 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). In the earliest case, the patient became ill on 1 December 2019 and had no reported link to the seafood market, the authors report.
“No epidemiological link was found between the first patient and later cases,” they state. Their data also show that, in total, 13 of the 41 cases had no link to the marketplace. “That’s a big number, 13, with no link,” says Daniel Lucey, an infectious disease specialist at Georgetown University.
Lucey says if the new data are accurate, the first human infections must have occurred in November 2019—if not earlier—because there is an incubation time between infection and symptoms surfacing. If so, the virus possibly spread silently between people in Wuhan—and perhaps elsewhere—before the cluster of cases from the city’s now-infamous Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was discovered in late December. “The virus came into that marketplace before it came out of that marketplace,” Lucey asserts.
But here’s where it gets interesting…
The Truth About 5G
Did you know that Wuhan was one of the first cities to roll out the 5G network? For those of you who are unfamiliar, 5G is the latest high-frequency network and is being rolled out aggressively around the world.
To enable 5G deployment, wireless providers will use submillimeter and millimeter waves in frequency ranges above 6 GHz to 100 GHz and beyond, so that much more data can be transmitted in the same amount of time.
However, these high-frequency waves can’t carry data very far. To use them, wireless companies will have to build a massive infrastructure of literally thousands of small transmitters to increase signal range and capacity. It is estimated that a transmitter will need to be placed every two to ten homes apart.
Non-ionizing electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are generated by devices that emit radiofrequency radiation (RF), including cell phones, cordless phones and their base stations, Wi-Fi, broadcast antennas, smart meters, and even baby monitors. Electronic devices and infrastructures used to deliver electricity that generate extremely-low frequency electromagnetic fields also produce EMF.
Published, peer-reviewed, scientific evidence indicates that even the current wireless technologies often lead to radiofrequency exposures which pose a serious health risk to humans, animals, plants, and the environment.
For instance, wireless frequencies in the millimeter and submillimeter range have been shown to interact directly with our skin, specifically sweat glands. Our skin is our largest organ. The ICNIRP, while developing recommendations for public exposure limits, appears to be planning to classify our skin as an extremity. In other words, our skin would be categorized as belonging to our limbs rather than head or torso, permitting it to be exposed to more radiation than would otherwise be allowed.
In her report “A 5G Wireless Future: Will it give us a Smart Nation or Contribute to an Unhealthy One?” Dr. Cindy Russell raises further concerns about the basic safety of currently used wireless technologies. She points out that the proposed 5G frequencies have not been tested for short- or long-term safety.
What does this have to do with coronavirus?
The 5G-Coronavirus Connection
In 2007, a report titled The BioInitiative was published. It was republished again in 2012, and there have been ongoing updates between 2014 and 2019. Its website states that:
The BioInitiative 2012 report has been prepared by 29 authors from ten countries, ten holding medical degrees (MDs), 21 PhDs, and three MsC, MA or MPHs. Among the authors are three former presidents of the Bioelectromagnetics Society, and five full members of BEMS.
These are highly respected scientists coming from some of the world’s most respected universities and institutes.
The BioInitiative further warns that “evidence for risks to health has substantially increased since 2007 from electromagnetic fields and wireless technologies (radiofrequency radiation). The Report reviews over 1800 new scientific studies…. Health topics include damage to DNA and genes, effects on memory, learning, behavior, attention, sleep disruption, cancer and neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s disease. New safety standards are urgently needed for protection against EMF and wireless exposures that now appear everywhere in daily life.”
What has not been apparent in the news reports is the fact that China in its rush to take the lead in the 5G race, had by the end of 2019 (and mostly within the last several months leading up to the COVID-19 outbreak) installed 130,000 5G antennas throughout the country, with at least 10,000 antennas installed in Wuhan alone. (As a comparison, the USA only has approximately 10,000 5G antennas presently installed throughout the whole country.)
Wireless radiation from 1G to 5G have all emitted modulated “Radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs)” and there are literally thousands of studies showing biological effects from exposures to man-made electromagnetic waves, and out of these, hundreds showing biological effects on the immune system.
To give just one example, research by Kolomytseva, et al. found that “with whole-body exposure of healthy mice to low-intensity extremely-high-frequency electromagnetic radiation (EHF EMR, 42.0 GHz, 0.15 mW/cm2, 20 min daily)… phagocytic activity of peripheral blood neutrophils was suppressed by about 50% (p < 0.01 as compared with the sham-exposed control) in 2-3 hours after the single exposure to EHF EM” and that this “effect persisted for 1 day after the exposure, and then the phagocytic activity of neutrophils returned to the norm within 3 days.”
The researchers concluded that “the results indicated that the whole-body exposure of healthy mice to low-intensity EHF EMR has a profound effect on the indices of nonspecific immunity.”
Are Bigger Networks to Blame for Outbreaks?
Interestingly, at one point in this saga, the second most hit (with the COVID-19) provinces were Zhejiang and Guangdong Provinces, (though as of this writing, Zhejiang has now been taken over by Henan). The provinces listed below, in Chinese, and in order of most cases, are Hubei, Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang, and Hunan.
It has been so bad in Zhejiang Province that Japan, on Feb. 12th, even extended its entry restrictions to virus-hit Zhejiang (at the time was third in number of COVID-19 cases).
It includes the cities of Hangzhou and Wenzhou, which have among the country’s highest concentrations of coronavirus cases. Hangzhou hosts the headquarters of Alibaba Group Holding, while Wenzhou is famed as a cradle of small business.
These cities (Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and Ningbo) have also been cities selected to trial the 5G in Zhejiang province.
In the city of Hangzhou, all three Chinese telecoms are providing 5G service in the city; whereas in Ningbo, only two are, and in Wenzhou, only one (China Mobile) is.
The three cities in Zhejiang Province with the most cases have been Hangzhou (168 cases), Ningbo (156 cases), and Wenzhou (503 cases), 50 which are also curiously the cities selected to trial the 5G. The city proper of Wenzhou itself (though when one includes the outer-lying prefectures the total comes 9 million), for example, with only 200,000 people, has an inordinately high number of people infected with COVID-19, and the city has been on lockdown.
While there are still plenty of questions, we do know a few things:
5G radiation negatively impacts the immune system
Patients living outside of 5G zones are more likely to have milder symptoms or no symptoms at all
In the months leading up to the coronavirus outbreak, there were over 10,000 5G antennas installed in Wuhan
Cities with the highest rates of coronavirus infection tend to also have recently deployed 5G networks
There has been virtually no testing on the effects of 5G on people, plants, and animals
And 5G may even be making the virus more severe.
Is 5G Making Coronavirus Worse?
An Asia Times article from 2019 stated that there were 31 different 5G base stations in Wuhan at the end of 2018. There were plans developed later to place 10,000 5G antennae by the end of 2019, with most of those being on 5G LED smart street lamps.
The first such smart streetlamp was put in place on May 14, 2019, but large numbers only started being put in place in October 2019, such that there was a furious pace of such placement in the last 2 ½ months of 2019.
These findings show that the rapid pace of the coronavirus epidemic developed at least roughly as the number of 5G antennae became extraordinarily high. So, we have this finding that China’s 1st 5G smart city and smart highway is the epicenter of this epidemic and this finding that the epidemic only became rapidly more severe as the numbers of 5G antennae skyrocketed.
Are these findings coincidental or does 5G have some causal role in exacerbating the coronavirus epidemic? In order to answer that question, we need to determine whether the downstream effects of VGCC activation exacerbate the viral replication, the effects of viral infection, especially those that have roles in the spread of the virus and also the mechanism by which this coronavirus causes death.
This virus has stoked international fear. Governments are exercising unprecedented power over their citizens, social and mainstream media outlets are being silenced and censored, and innocent people are being detained for fear that they may have the virus. Scientists are feverishly working on a vaccine to combat the virus (an entirely separate issue that we’ll write about in more depth soon).
Are There Solutions?
Based on the 5G-COVID-19 connection, it is apparent that mitigating exposure to wireless radiation is imperative. Here in the Bollinger household, we are using “Qi” technology to create a “safe home” environment.  Qi Technologies is a German-patented technology that cancels out the EMF frequency. This gives you a safe EMF-free zone for you and your family.
There are 12 research studies indicating that Qi technology is effective at mitigating EMF by up to 70%. That’s a HUGE improvement in your home living environment! (See below for links to 2 of the studies)

There are natural ways to fight off viral infections and keep your immune system healthy, one of which is vitamin C, which is currently being used in China against COVID-19 coronavirus and has been officially recommended by the Shanghai government.
The coronavirus can be dramatically slowed, or stopped, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C. Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.
Is vitamin C a “cure” for coronavirus? The reality is that there is no “cure” for coronavirus (or any virus for that matter). We are exposed to literally thousands of ‘harmful’ viruses each and every day, but with a functioning immune system and intake of natural antivirals, we shouldn’t have to worry about any of the viruses … including coronavirus!
That’s why we are taking PuraThrive Liposomal Vitamin C each and every day. Why liposomal? Because it is the only route of administration that’s as “bioavailable” (absorbable) as IV injections, and it’s much cheaper and less invasive.

Want proof that vitamin C may be an answer? Anyone saying that vitamin therapy can stop coronavirus is already being labeled as “promoting false information” and promulgating “fake news.” Even the sharing of verifiable news, and direct quotes from credentialed medical professionals, is being restricted or blocked on social media.
Another supplement we take every day is iodine (specifically Detoxadine, formulated by Dr. Edward Group). Iodine exhibits activity against bacteria, molds, yeasts, protozoa, and many viruses. Interestingly, of all the antiseptic preparations suitable for direct use on humans and animals and upon tissues, only iodine is capable of killing all classes of pathogens (gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, mycobacteria, fungi, yeasts, viruses and protozoa).

According to Dr. David Brownstein:
Iodine is essential to not only fighting off an infection it is necessary for proper immune system functioning. There is no bacteria, virus, parasite or fungus that is known to be resistant to iodine.”
Remember … when it comes to the coronavirus (or any other bacteria or virus for that matter) …
Don’t worry … BE HEALTHY!

Three Intravenous Vitamin C Research Studies Approved for Treating COVID-19,"originally published on www.orthomolecular.org by Andrew W. Saul, Editor
Vitamin C used for COVID-19
Intravenous vitamin C is already being employed in China against COVID-19 coronavirus. I am receiving regular updates because I am part of the Medical and Scientific Advisory Board to the International Intravenous Vitamin C China Epidemic Medical Support Team. Its director is Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD; associate director is Hong Zhang, PhD. Among other team members are Qi Chen, PhD (Associate Professor, Kansas University Medical School); Jeanne Drisko, MD (Professor, University of Kansas Medical School); Thomas E. Levy, MD, JD; and Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD. (Professor, Kyorin University, Tokyo). CLICK HERE to read the treatment protocol information.

Direct report from China
OMNS Chinese edition editor Dr. Richard Cheng is reporting from China about the first approved study of 12,000 to 24,000 mg/day of vitamin C by IV. The doctor also specifically calls for immediate use of vitamin C for prevention of coronavirus (COVID-19).

A second clinical trial of intravenous vitamin C was announced in China on Feb. 13th. (VIDEO) In this second study, says Dr. Cheng, “They plan to give 6,000 mg/day and 12,000 mg/day per day for moderate and severe cases. We are also communicating with other hospitals about starting more intravenous vitamin C clinical studies. We would like to see oral vitamin C included in these studies, as the oral forms can be applied to more patients and at home.”
And on Feb 21, 2020, announcement has been made of a third research trial now approved for intravenous vitamin C for COVID-19. (VIDEO).

Dr. Cheng, who is a US board-certified specialist in anti-aging medicine, adds:
Vitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2,000 people have died of the COIV-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard large dose intravenous vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.”
He adds that:
Early and sufficiently large doses of intravenous vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but also involved in virus killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose intravenous vitamin C is not just at antiviral level. It is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that kills most people from coronaviral pandemics (SARS, MERS and now NCP). ARDS is a common final pathway leading to death. We therefore call for a worldwide discussion and debate on this topic.”
News of vitamin C research for COVID-19 is being actively suppressed
Anyone saying that vitamin therapy can stop coronavirus is already being labeled as “promoting false information” and promulgating “fake news.” Even the sharing of verifiable news, and direct quotes from credentialed medical professionals, is being restricted or blocked on social media. You can see sequential examples of this phenomenon at my Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/themegavitaminman .
Indeed, the World Health Organization (WHO) has, literally, met with Google and Facebook and other media giants to stop the spread of what they declare to be wrong information.
Physician-directed, hospital-based administration of intravenous vitamin C has been marginalized or discredited. Scientific debate over COVID-19 appears to not be allowed.
Ironically, Facebook, blocking any significant users’ sharing of the news of approved vitamin therapy research, is itself blocked in China by the Chinese government. As for the internet, yes, China has it. And yes, it is censored. But, significantly, the Chinese government has not blocked this real news on how intravenous vitamin C will save lives in the COVID-19 epidemic.
Medical orthodoxy obsessively focuses on searching for a vaccine and/or drug for coronavirus COVID-19). While they are looking for what would be fabulously profitable approaches, we have with vitamin C an existing, plausible, clinically demonstrated method to treat what coronavirus patients die from: severe acute respiratory syndrome, or pneumonia.
And it is available right now.

TTAC Comments:
Three research studies in China have approved vitamin C for treating COVID-19. Confirmation has also been obtained that 50 TONS of vitamin C has been shipped to Wuhan province, and on March 3rd, the Shanghai government officially recommended Vitamin C for COVID-19.
Sharing information on COVID-19 vitamin therapy research has now been systematically blocked and censored by Facebook and other social media giants and labeled as “false information” or “fake news.” However, all OMNS releases are duly referenced to the research literature. Since when is properly referenced medical literature “fake news”?
Case in point — Rob Schneider merely tweeted a screenshot of the scientific studies, and his tweet was blocked!

"CORONAVIRUS: “The Good, the Bad, and the Answers!”","Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past few weeks, you’ve likely heard about and been appropriately “terrorized” by reports of a novel, deadly coronavirus that is sweeping the globe. Today, we want to share with you some bad news, some good news, and some answers!
We’ve written a few articles on the new coronavirus (nCoV-2019) over the past few weeks, so feel free to hit the links below to “catch up” on what’s been going on.
 20 Million Quarantined as “Deadly” Coronavirus Reaches the U.S.
 National Health Emergency Declared
 Man-Made Coronavirus Kills Hundreds (Bill Gates has a Vaccine for That)
Read on as we unmask the truth behind the coronavirus outbreak and bring you up to speed on the good, the bad, and the ugly answers. 😉
THE BAD NEWS
In China, people are literally being physically dragged out of their homes and are being forcibly relocated to “mass quarantine camps” with multitudes of other very sick people. There are also some very disturbing videos of what appears to be people being shot for not complying with the quarantine.

There are also reports (from NaturalNews and CNN) that the death toll is drastically understated, with possibly over 50,000 dead.
The United States government is preparing for a pandemic. That’s reality.
The Department of Defense already has quarantine centers at Fort Carson in Colorado, Travis Air Force Base and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in California, and Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.
The military is also preparing 11 new quarantine centers across the country.
JB Pearl Harbor-Hickam, HI (HNL)
Great Lakes Training Center Navy Base, IL (ORD)
Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base, TX (DFW)
March ARB, CA (LAX)
Travis AFB, CA (SFO)
Dobbins ARB, GA (ATL)
Fort Hamilton, NY (JFK)
Naval Base Kitsap, WA (SEA)
Joint Base Anacostia, DC (IAD)
Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, NJ (EWR)
Fort Custer Training Center, MI (DTW)
Hundreds of evacuees from China have been flown to various U.S. locations, including the city where we were married – San Antonio! The CDC is quarantining the evacuees for 14 days, after which they will be released to return to their homes.
MORE BAD NEWS
The 14 day quarantine period is based on an assumption that the nCoV-2019 has a maximum 2 week incubation period.
But what if that assumption was wrong?
What if the incubation period was actually 24 days?
If that were the case, the CDC would, in reality, be releasing people into the population 10 days too early!
Guess what? That’s exactly what’s happening!
According to a science paper published on the MedRxIV website, the incubation period ranges from zero to 24 days!
OOPS!
But that’s not the only mistake the CDC has made. According to a February 11th article posted on The Hill, they admittedly (“accidentally”) released an evacuee from Wuhan, China, who was under federal quarantine in San Diego, long before the 14-day quarantine requirement.
According to a brief statement released by UC San Diego Health on Feb 11th:
Four patients admitted to its isolation units last week were discharged back to their quarantine quarters at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar after the CDC said coronavirus tests came back negative. Further testing revealed that one of the four patients tested positive for coronavirus.
According to Dr. Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC:
It turns out there was probably a mix-up, and the original test wasn’t negative.
She did not provide any information about how the ‘mix-up’ happened. She also apparently has an issue with double negatives. Why not just admit that the test was “positive” (rather than “not negative”)?
OK, maybe I’m nitpicking…
But all is well … I mean … he DID come back to quarantine after being ordered to do so by the CDC. I’m sure he didn’t come into contact with anyone after he was accidentally released due to a ‘mix-up’ with the “not negative” testing results. I’m sure he didn’t spread the virus … yeah right!
OOPS!
Oh yeah, one more thing… The CDC is now admitting that its own test kits (which were widely distributed to hospitals and clinics across all 50 states) are inaccurate.
According to Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of one of the CDC’s centers:
State labs reported some inconclusive lab results.
OOPS!
In the words of Mike Adams:
The test kits are a joke, producing 50% – 70% false negatives, which means people who have the coronavirus are falsely confirmed to be virus-free.

THE GOOD NEWS
The good news is that you do NOT need to be afraid. God has given us all we need to be healthy in nature. That includes providing us with natural antivirals and botanicals that can be very effective at treating coronavirus.
You see, when a virus infects the body, it first finds a cell and latches onto a protein on the cell’s surface called a receptor. The virus then enters the cell via a vesicle called an “endosome.” From inside this vesicle, it releases its RNA into the cell’s cytoplasm, and then the virus hijacks the human cell’s machinery to produce the viral proteins needed for replication, and it uses its own viral enzyme to copy its RNA. Finally, the viral proteins and RNA assemble into a structure that lets the virus leave the cell and move on and infect the next cell… and so on… and so on.
Antivirals target various points in this process of viral replication. Below are a few potent antivirals with supporting research study links.
Silver Nanoparticles (STUDY, STUDY)
Licorice Root (STUDY)
Essential Oils (eucalyptus, clove, grapefruit, cinnamon leaf, tea tree, and lemon balm)
Orange Peel (STUDY)
Oregano (STUDY)
Garlic (STUDY)
Ginger (STUDY)
Elderberry Extract (STUDY, STUDY)
Selenium (STUDY)
Not surprisingly, in multiple studies, turmeric has also been shown to be effective at treating SARS coronavirus (STUDY, STUDY). Niclosamide (a prescription medication used to treat tapeworms) is one of the prescription drugs used to treat SARS coronavirus that could be considered for treating nCoV-2019 (STUDY).
ANSWERS “HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT”!
What if one of the answers for coronavirus was “hidden in plain sight” … in CHINA? Our good friend, Mike Adams, recently wrote an article about a phytochemical called “savinin” which is found in plants that grow in China and are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Savinin has been shown to possess potent antiviral activity against SARS coronavirus (STUDY).
In other words, the people of China are living among the very herbs that could possibly cure them, but since China has been overtaken by Big Pharma and TCM is no longer practiced, they don’t know that savinin could help them!
How ironic … and how SAD!
There are likely thousands of Chinese people dying right now from the coronavirus pandemic, even as this herb grows all around them.

Many of these botanicals, roots, and molecules mentioned in this article actually target the coronavirus “3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL) enzyme” which is well known as a molecular target when searching for coronavirus inhibitors.
For example, a study published in BMC Structural Biology discusses the role of 3CL and why inhibiting this enzymatic function is a valid method for blocking coronavirus replication (STUDY).
If you do a web search for “inhibition of SARS-CoV 3CL protease” you’ll discover some of the potent plant compounds that can inhibit 3CL, including two of my favorites – Quercetin and Epigallocatechin Gallate aka EGCG from green tea (STUDY).
Mike Adams has also identified 3 natural molecules that inhibit coronavirus replication by inhibiting the 3CL protease enzyme (STUDY).
Herbacetin (found in flaxseed)
Rhoifolin (found in citrus peels)
Pectolinarin (found in “tickberry” weeds)
His research is backed up by a recent study which confirmed that these 3 flavonoids had the best inhibitory effects against SARS coronavirus (STUDY). A January 2020 paper published in the Journal of Enzyme Inhibition and Medicinal Chemistry also confirms that these 3 flavonoids were found to efficiently block the enzymatic activity of SARS coronavirus (STUDY).
Many other research papers already exist on the inhibition of SARS coronavirus via the 3CL protease pathway (LINK).
DON’T WORRY … BE HEALTHY!
It’s time to become educated about this outbreak. And it’s time to make sure you are doing everything you can to get and stay healthy, as the most likely people to suffer the most are those who are already immune-compromised.
Remember, God has provided all we need in Creation!

You just gotta know where to look, Honey!

5 Cancer-Fighting Essential Oils & 5 Ways to Use Them,"Essential oils are one of the most potent forms of plant-based medicine in the world. From killing viruses (like coronavirus), to promoting relaxation, to soothing skin scrapes, to supporting the immune system, essential oils offer countless benefits to your life.
To be clear – the use of these oils is no “fad.” Essential oils have thousands of years of history in traditional medicine, in the most ancient of cultures. The Egyptians, the Chinese, the Greeks… they all used essential oils.
From the times of Biblical medicine on through to today, essential oils are used throughout the world. Until fairly recently they’ve been better accepted and popular outside of the United States… but I’m happy to see that so many Americans are catching on to the immense benefits of these healing oils.
One of my favorite examples of the long history and effectiveness of essential oils is about a group of thieves in England who, despite daily contact with corpses who had succumbed to the Black Death (the plague), didn’t get sick.
The story goes that the King heard about these men who would enter the homes of those taken by the plague, rob them of all their valuables, yet did not fall ill from the highly contagious disease. The King had these thieves captured and when they were brought in front of him, he demanded they reveal their secret.
They confessed to being from a family of a long line of apothecaries. They were familiar with the immune protection provided by certain blends of oils, which they would rub all over their bodies, before going thieving. They say the King forced the men to reveal their recipe and then subsequently used the oils to protect himself and his family from the ravages of the Black Death. They also say the recipe is still in the Royal archives to this day.
Now I don’t know if all this is all true or not, but the moral of the story is certainly sound. My own personal appreciation of the wide variety of benefits of essential oils (including their ability to protect the body from harm) began during my initial travels for The Quest for the Cures and A Global Quest documentary series. It was then that I realized how truly overlooked essential oils are as a component of the puzzle that is health and healing from disease.
These days, my family and I use essential oils in a variety of ways on a daily basis. Our uses for these therapeutic powerhouses are wide-ranging. I’ll list out more further down, but a few ways we personally use essential oils include as medicines, for personal care products, as our cleansing agents, and more.
Why do we believe everyone should follow in our footsteps and rely on essential oils, too?
It’s simple. My family has opted to use safe, natural remedies that have thousands of years of history proving their benefits, over a dependence on prescriptions of synthetic drugs that have a long list of side effects which are nothing short of dangerous.
Likewise, we prefer to use personal care products and household cleaners that are superior alternatives to those containing toxic ingredients. We get the same, or even better results, while losing the risk of damaging our bodies.
Charlene and I are frequently asked about what essential oils we favor, and also how we use them. So, I thought I’d share with you some of our favorite anti-cancer oils and some tips for uses. Before I list our favorite essential oils for preventing and healing from cancer, just a reminder that when you are choosing essential oils to always look for the highest quality. You want oils that are certified organic, with 100% purity.
5 Amazing Anti-Cancer Essential Oils (in alphabetical order)
1. Frankincense 
Frankincense may well be my number one favorite essential oil for its anti-cancer properties. It is anti-inflammatory, for one, which is vital in the quest to heal from all cancers. Specifically, frankincense has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme responsible for inflammation in the body.
Frankincense essential oil also helps boost immune function and prevent illness by dangerous pathogens by multiplying white blood cells and modulating immune reactions.
It also helps improve circulation, and reduce stress (it has sedative properties), as well as being a known pain reliever. Oil of frankincense has been shown to contract and tone tissues, which helps to speed regeneration.
Frankincense is also shown to provide neurological support, including the ability to destroy toxins that may lead to neurological damage.
However, this essential oil has several benefits beyond cancer treatment, including easing arthritis pain, balancing hormones, encouraging skin health, and aiding digestion.
2. Lavender
As I’ve written elsewhere on The Truth About Cancer site, lavender essential oil contains the phytochemicals perillyl alcohol and linalool, both found to support cancer healing. Not only is lavender a known pain reliever, true lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is anti-tumoral, and has demonstrated significant results in resetting the programmed cell death usually lacking in cancer cells. It has been observed to reduce the weight of tumors, and inhibit cell growth.
Lavender essential oil reduces stress and supports the function of the immune system. Quality of sleep is improved. Depression and anxiety are relieved. All of these go towards supporting the immune system in the often immuno-compromised cancer patient. Yet lavender oil has several direct antibacterial properties, as well.
Studies have shown lavender essential oil to be effective against many common germs, as well as the more serious ones such as Staphylococcus aureus (“golden staph”). It does so by supporting the macrophages and phagocytes systems in the body, as well as helping the body fight the infection through its influence on genetic activity.
3. Myrrh
Myrrh is one of those somewhat obscure essential oils that has a variety of powerful healing properties that should not be overlooked. In terms of cancer, myrrh essential oil exhibits notable effects on cancer cell growth, and contains anti-inflammatory properties.
In addition, myrrh is known to support healthy hormone balance, which can be essential in cancer healing. Like lavender and frankincense, myrrh oil has long been used as a pain reliever. It is also anti-fungal. With all these qualities, myrrh is a potent therapeutic support for your health.
4. Peppermint
Peppermint is another “wonder-oil,” with a wide range of benefits. This essential oil’s cancer benefits come from its phytochemicals limonene, phytochemicals beta-caryophyllene, and beta-pinene, which have defined cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory effects.
Studies have also shown peppermint essential oil to reveal antioxidant and cancer inhibiting properties, suppressing growth of tumors. In addition, peppermint oil contains antiangiogenic properties, which prevent tumors from developing their own blood supply.
Peppermint essential oil is a well-known antiseptic, with antimicrobial components that benefit respiratory infections (such as bronchitis), open wounds, tonsillitis, and laryngitis. Peppermint is so powerful it’s even useful against stronger bacterias such as Staphylococcus aureus and others that are often antibiotic resistant.
5. Turmeric (Curcumin)
In labs, curcumin has been found to inhibit enzymes such as COX-2 that cause inflammation which can lead to cancer, to activate a gene that suppresses tumors, cut cancer cells off from their fuel and oxygen sources, to kill large B-cell lymphoma cells, prevent cancer stem cells from regrowing, and stop the spread of cancer (metastasis).
Turmeric essential oil has been shown in studies to differentiate between normal and cancerous cells, while promoting apoptosis (cancer cell death).
This power-house oil has other benefits as well, including: helping to regulate blood sugar, help wounds heal faster, prevent Alzheimer’s disease, prevent help you lose weight, and ease arthritis.

5 Tips for Using Essential Oils for Heath & Healing
Using essential oils is so integral to my family’s life, it’s hard to list every way we use them! However, here are some top tips for using essential oils in your daily life. [Be sure to check my list of precautions below to get the most from your oils.]
Put a drop behind your ears. For example, every day Charlene uses myrrh and frankincense behind her ears and on her lymph nodes as a prophylactic (preventative protection). Lavender or peppermint would be good for respiratory issues, or simply to relax. You can rub on the back of the skull, the breasts, or the bottoms of your feet.
Use a cold diffuser. We love to diffuse essential oils throughout our home. We do it for added mental clarity, and immune support for the entire family. My office is always filled with the therapeutic aromas of a variety of essential oils.
Massage into the skin. Some essential oils, like peppermint and clove, are very strong and you’ll do well to choose a good “carrier oil.” You use a good quality, organic (preferably cold-pressed) oil like coconut, olive, or jojoba to mix in a few drops of the essential oil of your choice. You can then massage this simple “body butter” onto your skin. For a bit fancier body butter, use a mixer to whip solid coconut oil with essential oil. Use this mixture to apply directly to affected areas (such as with pain, arthritis, or digestive issues), and for quick absorption and overall health benefits.
Ingest Internally. One of my favorite, refreshing drinks I like to make is a “Peppermint Lemonade.” I simply take 2-3 drops of peppermint essential oil, 3-4 drops of lemon (or orange or tangerine oils, depending on my mood), add water, some organic green stevia, and ice in a large pitcher. It’s a super-fast, healthy beverage that I love. It’s also delicious as a hot beverage (use hot water and omit the ice). If you’re just making one cup at a time, use only 1 drop of peppermint + 1 drop of a citrus oil. Essential oils are powerful and a little goes a long way! You can also use a few drops of essential oils in an empty gel capsule and swallow it.
Toothpaste. You can make a variety of personal products using organic essential oils and other non-toxic ingredients: lotions, face washes, mouthwash, soaps. A toothpaste is easy to make using high quality, certified organic frankincense, myrrh, and coconut oil. Maybe add in some baking soda if you prefer, too.
Precautions for Using Essential Oils:
Quality. This is so important that it bears repeating. Always use a top-quality, medicinal grade oil. It should be certified organic, and 100% pure. Check the reputation of your supplier, and ensure there are no fillers or additives.
Keep oils away from sensitive areas. Essential oils are nature’s powerhouses. Keep in mind they are 40-50 times more potent than the plant itself. Some oils are more “spicy” than others. Some taste better than others. Oregano is one that can burn a bit when you ingest it directly. Peppermint requires caution, and usually does best with a carrier oil when applying to the skin. Never apply essential oils to sensitive areas of the body, including the genitals or near your eyes.You should also test new oils to ensure there are no reactions before applying too liberally. You can start by doing a sniff test of the oil in the bottle. If that seems fine, then apply a dab of carrier oil to the inside of your wrist or arm, add a drop of oil and wait to see if there is any redness, itching, or swelling. Everybody and every body is different so you may need to try different oils to see which ones feel best to you.
Do not heat oils. You’ve probably seen or even have one of those oil burners for using essential oils. What you may not know is that heating these oils destroys their healing properties. It’s always best to use a cold diffuser. These are plentiful and economically priced online.
Children. Always be cautious when using essential oils with children. Diffusion is safest. For direct application, it’s important to dilute the stronger oils, especially with a good carrier oil. When making body butters or massage oils for children, use 1 drop of essential oil to 4 tablespoons of carrier oil. This will dilute the essential oil enough to make it more tolerable and safer for your child. Be very careful not to place near the eyes and always do a sensitivity test first.
