"5 Million Potential Coronavirus Carriers Have Already Left Wuhan, Mayor Reveals","Meanwhile, Chinese health officials ­warn “there are signs showing the virus is becoming more transmissible.”
Wuhan’s mayor Zhou Xianwang revealed on Sunday during a press conference that about 5 million residents had already left the city before the lockdown because of the coronavirus outbreak and the Spring Festival holiday.
As the SCMP reports, many of Wuhan’s residents had already left the city for the holiday, while others rushed out after the lockdown was announced on Wednesday night.


As a result, only 9 million people were remaining in the city after the lockdown, with roughly a third of the population—including countless cases of coronavirus—having already spread across China.

Meanwhile, Chinese health officials ­warned the virus’ ­ability to spread was ­getting ­stronger. Ma Xiaowei, the minister in charge of China’s National Health Commission (NHC), told a press conference that battling the outbreak had become especially complicated, after it was discovered that the new virus could be transmitted even during incubation period, which did not happen with Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome).
In other words, as many as tens if not hundreds of thousands of Coronavirus carriers quietly fled, and may have infected as many as 3-4 other people each, depending on the R0 of the virus.
From observations, the virus is capable of transmission even during incubation period,” Ma said, adding that the incubation period lasted from one to 14 days. “Some patients have normal temperatures and there are many milder cases. There are hidden carriers,” he said.




As for the piece de resistance, Ma said also that the virus had adapted to humans and appeared to have become more transmissible:
“There are signs showing the virus is becoming more transmissible. These walking ‘contagious agents’ [hidden carriers] make controlling the outbreak a lot more difficult.“
Even China’s authorities sounds like they are giving up: Li Bin, deputy minister of the NHC said the authorities that the severe measures they had taken to control the spread of the virus – such as issuing travel bans and locking down cities – would at least delay the peak and “buy time to combat the next stage of the outbreak”, according to SCMP.
Yes, China is already bracing for “the next stage of the outbreak.”
To help tackle the epidemic, which has closed off 17 cities, Ma said that 2,360 military and civilian doctors and nurses had been sent to Wuhan, the city in which the outbreak was first detected at the end of last month. As the pressure has mounted on the city’s hospitals, the medical system has moved ever closer to collapse.
Many people who developed feverish symptoms were turned away by hospitals earlier in the week because there were not enough beds, local residents said earlier. Medical practitioners are also running seriously short of protective kits and are being forced to recycle goggles and masks. Ma said 2,400 hospital beds had been added in Wuhan, and the government was planning to add 5,000 more over the next three days.
Wang Jiangping, China’s vice-minister of industry and information technology, said China had the capacity to produce a maximum of 30,000 protective outfits per day, but that was less than a third of what was needed in Hubei.
Meanwhile, the hunt for the real source of the pandemic continues. China imposed a nationwide ban on wildlife trade on Sunday, as the outbreak was originally suspected to have originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, which also sold wild animals.
However, that appears to not be the source. A research paper published by medical journal The Lancet on Saturday said the first confirmed case of the viral infection was a person who had not been to that market.

3.5% People With Coronavirus Die – Live Map Let’s You See & Track Coronavirus Outbreak In Realtime,"The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is constantly evolving with new developments and reports emerging by the hour. If you want to get a reliable overview of some of the latest insights, you can check out a live map and dashboard created to track some of the latest updates from the outbreak.
Researchers at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering have created a live map and dashboard, allowing you to track the global spread of the deadly coronavirus that began in Wuhan, China. The map updates data daily from the World Health Organization and the respective centers for disease control in the U.S., Europe, and China, among others.
As explained in a blog post by Johns Hopkins, the data is scooped from a number of sources, including the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the European CDC, the Chinese CDC, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, and other Chinese aggregator sites. Updates to the dashboard are not instantaneous, but it’s generally revised every hour or so as fresh reports come in.


Confirmed cases are shown on the map with a red-orange dot – the larger the circle, the higher the number of cases. For example, you can see that Hubei, the Chinese province where the outbreak started, has over 2,700 confirmed cases. You can also click the circle to get more information on each country or region.
The right side of the dashboard also features the confirmed deaths (currently standing at 107) and the number of recovered patients (currently 63). The left shows the number of confirmed cases by country and region, along with a small graph highlighting the increased rate of cases.




Currently known as 2019-nCoVs, the pathogen belongs to the coronavirus family, which also includes SARS. The first reports of the infection started in December 2019 in Wuhan, a city of 11 million and the capital of Hubei province in central China. Since then, the pneumonia-like illness has spread at an ever-increasing rate.
At least 4,474 confirmed cases of the deadly infection have been reported worldwide as of 16:00 UTC on January 28, 2020, according to the dashboard. On January 27, there were less than 3,000 confirmed cases. The huge majority of cases are in mainland China with approximately 4,409 cases, but it has now been reported in 15 countries around the world, with 8 cases reported each in Hong Kong and Thailand, 6 in Macau, 5 each in Australia, Singapore, the US, and Taiwan, 4 each in Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia, 3 in France, 2 in Vietnam, and 1 in Canada, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Germany.

Coronavirus: Black Light Images Show How Important It’s Now To Wash Your Hands Thoroughly,"A number of recent photos have appeared on social media, showing the importance of washing your hands properly.
As the Coronavirus, also known officially as ‘Covid-19’, continues to spread around the world, health organizations are asking people to take basic protective measures to contain the spread of the deadly disease, including and especially hand washing.
While it may seem obvious, the following black light photos show that there is a difference between hand washing and thorough hand washing.


American actress Kristen Bell shared a collage of six pictures on Instagram that show the difference between unwashed hands and hands washed with soap for 30 seconds.

“My mother sent me the comparison to washing my hands with the black light photos. 30 SECONDS WITH SOAP, SEE HERE !!! ”is Bell’s caption.
Each of the six photos shows how many bacteria were on a woman’s hand using black light and a cream called Glo-Germ, a mineral oil that sticks to germs and is only visible under UV light.
The pictures show the hands in various stages of cleanliness, including “before washing”, after washing “only with water”, after “six seconds and without soap” and “30 seconds with soap”.
The first photos show that a large number of bacteria had been left behind, and although they are more similar, there was also a clear difference between a 15-second wash with soap and a 30-second wash.
The Instagram post published on Bell’s Instagram page has since collected more than 428,000 likes and received thousands of comments from people, many of whom are parents who plan to show the photos to their children.
“I can well imagine what my five-year-old’s hands look like under this thing,” commented one person.
Another added: “I’ll show it all to my kids, hopefully it works.”
According to the general recommendation of the health authorities, we should all wash our hands for at least 20 seconds, or as long as it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” twice.
Moisturize your hands with water before applying enough soap to cover your hands and rub them together.
The right technique should be to rub the back of the other hand with one hand and clean between the fingers before rubbing the back of the fingers against the palms.
It is recommended to wash your hands after using the toilet, before and after handling raw food, before eating or handling food, and after blowing your nose, sneezing or coughing.

Canada’s First Coronavirus Vaccine Made Is Now In Testing Stages
While the world is making monumental changes in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, a vaccine is being worked on in Canada. And now, a Saskatchewan coronavirus vaccine is officially in the testing stages. Although there is still a long road ahead for human use, officials are working hard as more grant money comes in.




Back in January 2020, it was announced that the University of Saskatchewan received permission from the Public Health Agency of Canada to start working on a vaccine for COVID-19.
Since then, researchers have been accepting grants to help the process along.
While it could take up to a year to complete, CJWW has confirmed with the University of Saskatchewan’s Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization-International Vaccine Centre that the vaccine is now being tested on animals.
As of now, there is no timeline as to when it could be ready for human use.
Volker Gerdts, CEO and Director of VIDO-InterVac, told CJWW that everything learned from the first SARS outbreak gives the researchers an idea of what the vaccine will have to look like.

He also added that as they are now a few weeks away from finishing research stages, he is positive the vaccine will work.
Once the animal testing is complete, the research team will then need to send any viable vaccine away for clinical studies before being confirmed as safe for humans.

This massive milestone comes just after an announcement that the Saskatchewan research team was granted almost $1 million to develop the coronavirus vaccine.
According to a press release posted on March 6, the VIDO-InterVac team was part of a $2.67 million federal rapid research funding initiative aimed at contributing to global efforts for combating COVID-19.
This money will then help the 12-person team develop the best suitable vaccine.
According to the researchers, animal models are helping scientists to evaluate vaccines, antiviral medications, and drugs to protect animals and humans.
“The global race is on to find out which is the best animal model for replicating the disease observed in humans. Is it mice, hamsters, or ferrets? Whichever model works best is the one we’re going to use. Once the model is developed, we will then be able to test our vaccine candidates for effectiveness,” said Gerdts in the press release.
“We will make the models available to other investigators who have leading candidate vaccines, antiviral drugs and immunity-boosting therapies.”
Numbers of infected individuals are on the rise and as of March 12, the first child in Canada was diagnosed with COVID-19 in Calgary.
It is estimated that up to 70 percent of Canadians could be impacted by the pandemic, should it not be contained.",2020-03-15,https://medicine-today.net/coronavirus-black-light-images-show-how-important-its-now-to-wash-your-hands-thoroughly/

How Do I Know If I Have Coronavirus? 5 Questions Answered,"Editor’s note: The author of this article, Dr. Catharine Paules, is a Infectious Disease Specialist and Associate Professor of Medicine at Pennsylvania State University.
The new coronavirus, 2019 n-CoV, continues to spread in China, and cases are being diagnosed in many other countries, including the U.S.
With initial symptoms that resemble other diseases, many people are wondering how to know whether to seek medical help.


The biggest risk factors for being infected with the new coronavirus are travel to China, particularly Wuhan and other areas of Hubei Province, and close contact with a person who has a suspected or confirmed n-CoV case. Without those risk factors, the chance for the general American public of catching this virus is low.
However, the outbreak is rapidly changing, and it is unclear how the situation in the U.S. will evolve in upcoming weeks.
Most cases of 2019 n-CoV have had fever and signs of pneumonia, like cough or shortness of breath. In some cases people are not able to breathe on their own and require the use of a ventilator. A small percentage of people die.




If you experience any of these symptoms within 14 days of travel to China, or within 14 days of coming in close contact with an individual infected with the coronavirus, you should immediately call your health care provider. It is best to call ahead before going to a clinic or emergency room.
Your health care provider will evaluate you with the help of your state’s public health department and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If your travel history and reported symptoms fit with n-CoV infection, you may be tested for the virus. Right now that test can be performed only at the CDC, so your health care provider would send samples to the CDC for testing.
At this time of year many respiratory viruses are circulating in the community, including influenza, RSV, rhinovirus and human coronaviruses, which are different from the 2019 n-CoV virus. It is much more likely that you have one of these viruses than the 2019 n-CoV virus, even if you have traveled to China.
Yes. There are four human coronaviruses that circulate each year in the U.S. They cause 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract illnesses in the U.S., with mild symptoms akin to the common cold. Health care labs can test for these coronaviruses – but not for 2019 n-CoV.

Biolab for “Most Dangerous Pathogens on Earth” Opened in Wuhan Before Outbreak,"The Wuhan coronavirus—now called 2019-nCoV—is spreading rapidly at an alarming rate. There are an estimated 900 cases and 26 deaths in China alone in addition to confirmed patients in at least 9 countries with several potential cases inside the United States.
About 56 million people in several Chinese cities have been placed on quarantine due to the sudden outbreak of a deadly SARS-like virus called 2019-nCoV.
The illness is said to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan and quickly spread to other areas of China, then Japan, Thailand, South Korea, and the United States. Suspected cases have been reported in Australia and Scotland. However, it is possible that there is more to the story as Chinese authorities have been running a censorship campaign to prevent the spread of information about the virus that deviates from official statements.


One very strange coincidence in the development of this outbreak is the fact that a new biolab, tasked with studying the most dangerous pathogens on earth, recently began operating in Wuhan, where the illness is said to have originated.
Another thing #Chinaisgoodat Wuhan police said on January 1 that it had summoned eight people who spread “rumors” about the coronavirus situation for questioning and punishment. Says a quib,”The virus is not a social media post so can’t just be deleted.” Where are the 8 people? https://t.co/OBqNNhZBLH pic.twitter.com/o3g6hWGWUm

Back in 2017, just before experiments at the lab began, the prestigious science journal Nature published an article expressing concerns about pathogens escaping from the new Wuhan lab. The laboratory is a biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) facility, which is the highest level of biocontainment. BSL-4 facilities must meet rigid standards for decontaminating the area as well as workers after every experiment. However, BSL-4 labs remain extremely controversial because critics argue that these measures may not be enough to prevent a virus from escaping.
According to Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, the SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times.

In May of 2019, less than a year before the outbreak began, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a press release that gave an overview of the projects that the new lab was currently working on. The projects included SARS, Ebola, Hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, avian influenza A(H5N1), Rift Valley fever, and others.
Scientists have examined the genetic code of the new virus and have found that it is more closely related to SARS than any other human coronavirus. In BSL-4 labs, researchers can tweak or combine deadly viruses to create mutated strains of the original illness. A 2013 report in Nature indicated that scientists in China were creating hybrid viruses in labs.
“A team of scientists in China has created hybrid viruses by mixing genes from H5N1 and the H1N1 strain behind the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and showed that some of the hybrids can spread through the air between guinea pigs,” the article revealed.
The results of the hybrid virus experiment were published in the journal Science.
Such experiments are usually intended to teach scientists more about certain illnesses so they can be treated and prevented better, but other research has involved intentionally making certain viruses even more deadly than they already were. Regardless of the motivation, exposing people to these pathogens, even in the most secure of settings, can be risky especially considering the fact that contagions have escaped from secure labs in the past.

Coronavirus Has Mutated Into More Aggressive Disease According To New Study,"Coronavirus has evolved into two major lineages and it is possible to be infected with both, a new study shows.
Researchers at Peking University’s School of Life Sciences and the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai discovered that the virus has evolved into two major lineages – which have been branded “L” and “S” types. The team of experts from Beijing and Shanghai said the newer “L-type” strain spreads quickly and accounts for around 70 per cent of cases. However, the older “S-type”, which was the first known strain, appears to be milder, less infectious and is now becoming the more common strain people are being infected with.
A man who had undergone a genetic analysis after he tested positive on January 21 proved that it’s possible to be infected by both strains. In the paper the researchers, led by Professor Jian Lu and Dr Jie Cui, said: “Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020.



“Human intervention may have placed more severe selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly.
“On the other hand, the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure.”
This “human intervention” is thought to be the hospitalisation of people with the virus and the lockdown of areas where it was spreading fast.
Unfortunately, this new development hinders attempts to develop a vaccine.
Dr Stephen Griffin, of the Leeds Institute of Medical Research and chair of the virus division at the Microbiology Society, said developers would need to test whether their prototype vaccines would still neutralise both viruses.

He added the variations between the strains were “fairly limited” and may not be a “huge hurdle”.
“It is usually the case that when RNA viruses first cross-species barriers into humans they aren’t particularly well adapted to their new host – us.” Griffin said.
“Thus, they usually undergo some changes allowing them to adapt and become better able to replicate within, and spread from human-to-human.”
Virologist Professor Jonathan Ball told Telegraph UK that he believed a larger study needed to be done before worrying about vaccine hurdles.
“At the moment we don’t have hard evidence that the virus has changed with regards to disease severity or infectivity so we need to be cautious when interpreting these kinds of computer-based studies, interesting as they might be,” he said.
Dr Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at the University of Exeter Medical School, said it was impossible to know why the more aggressive strain has slowed down.
“We don’t really know the true picture in China,” he said. “Is the lower number of cases a true reflection? It could be the virus mutating to a less dangerous form, or it could be the superhuman lockdown measures.
“Or there could be a third reason which is genetic drift. RNA viruses are quite mistake-prone so over time they become not very good at replicating.”",2020-03-05,https://medicine-today.net/coronavirus-mutation/
Chinese Doctor Who Was Silenced for Warning About Coronavirus Has Died From the Virus,"Wuhan Central Hospital has officially announced the death of whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang.
Chinese doctor Li Wenliang, who blew the whistle on the novel coronavirus back in December and was later arrested by authorities in China, had died as a result of contracting the virus after Chinese state media reported his death, causing an uproar on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Corporate media quickly picked up the story and ran with it, clearly communicating that Li was a victim of 2019-nCoV.
However, Wuhan Central Hospital quickly denied reports of Li’s death, claiming he was still alive but in critical condition. It has now been revealed that the hospital and Chinese state media walked back on the initial report and ordered the deceased doctor be put back on life support in an attempt to control the narrative, after seeing the reaction on Weibo. U.S. corporate media immediately took note and changed their headlines and reports to fall in line with what Chinese state media was reporting. Almost instantly TMU was inundated with comments on our social media platforms labeling this article as fake news.


It appears that not long after, Chinese officials became aware that their efforts to control the narrative failed and again walked back on their reports. After confirming his death, yet again, corporate media changed their headlines and their reports yet again.
BBC’s Ross Atkins explained what happened:

This series of events is an excellent example of what independent media outlets like the Mind Unleashed deal with on a daily basis, albeit on a larger and more urgent scale. Fact checkers on social media platforms like Facebook are scanning our content daily looking for details they can flag as false, thus forcing us to jump through hoops to remove these strikes that inhibit our readers from seeing our content in their feeds. But today’s reporting on Dr. Li Wenliang showed us that news consumers are now acting as fact checkers themselves. The fake news scare has been so successful that readers are buying into the “if you see something, say something” marketing ploy resulting in comments and reports at the behest of the establishment narrative.
What this experience also showed was that U.S. corporate media is more than willing to report whatever China’s government and state media reports as fact despite a wealth of evidence that China’s government censors and issues false information in order to keep a tight grip on their preferred narrative. In the midst of a deadly pandemic is not the time to blindly trust reports from a not typically trustworthy source. In the midst of a deadly pandemic is the time to use resources and people power to investigate and search for hard proof. Unfortunately independent media does not have the same resources as corporate media giants but we do have a strong enough set of morals to not simply parrot the establishment narrative and flip flop our headlines simply because another country’s state media does.
Despite early praise from the World Health Organization (WHO) for China on their response to the recent novel coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese government is facing increasing backlash for its treatment of whistleblowers and journalists sharing news about the illness.
For public health situations such as this, the Chinese government has a strict bureaucracy in place to ensure that any information or direction comes directly from the authorities, which means that anyone sharing information different from official statements is considered a risk to national “harmony” or “security.”
Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old doctor working in Wuhan, was among the first of these whistleblowers who attempted to get the word out about the virus before it spread throughout the country. Today, global media reports have indicated that Li is the most recent victim of the virus, having just passed away after contracting 2019-nCoV.
The doctor first learned about the virus in late December when seven patients came through his hospital with a “SARS-like illness” and were subsequently quarantined.
The doctor sent out a post in his medical school alumni group on the Chinese messaging app WeChat about the situation, telling his friends to be careful. Screenshots of the post quickly went viral across WeChat before reaching global social media.




On January 3rd, Li and a few other medics at the hospital were arrested by the Wuhan police for rumor-mongering.
After an intense interrogation, Police allowed Li to return to home and to work after signing a statement promising not to commit further “unlawful acts.”
By January 12, just over a week after he was interrogated, Li was hospitalized and was suspected of having the virus. However, he did not test positive for the virus until February 1, after being hospitalized for nearly an entire month. Less than a week later, on February 6, he was reported to have died.
 

 
Li’s death is as tragic as it is concerning given that he was a young and healthy adult—not the typical immunocompromised cases we expect to see from something that people have been comparing to the flu—and was battling the virus on the frontlines.
One of the few U.S. citizens being vocal about their experience in quarantined Wuhan, being evacuated from China, and their resulting quarantine in the U.S. has expressed her suspicions about the situation on Twitter.
The CV whistle blowing doctor dying seems completely normal, and not at all suspicious….

Just moments ago, Wuhan Central Hospital denied reports of Li Wenliang’s death and claimed he was still alive but in critical condition.

Coronavirus Update: Five Things You Need to Know,"We’ve sifted through hundreds of articles and pulled out the most important developments of the last 24 hours.
News about the novel coronavirus spreading throughout the United States and across the world is developing rapidly.
It can be difficult and overwhelming to keep up with everything happening so we’ve sifted through hundreds of articles and pulled out what we feel are the most important developments of the last 24 hours so you don’t have to.


Here are five huge developments that you need to know about the global outbreak of COVID-19 and the novel coronavirus.


🦠 The Latest COVID-19 Updates You Need to Know! 🦠
Posted by Emma Leigh on Thursday, March 5, 2020
Yale professor, radiologist, and healthcare management expert Howard Forman warns, “There is absolutely going to be an explosion in the number of identified cases. But how fast that number increases is highly dependent on how fast we can test.” Forman said that testing for coronavirus is an integral part in controlling the spread, adding that the U.S is not doing enough and efforts thus far have been “woefully inadequate.”
King County, Washington has encouraged its 2.2 million residents to stay home for the next three weeks. The county that includes the city of Seattle, is suggesting that anyone over the age of 60 stay indoors, that people telecommute rather than physically go into work, and that residents refrain from licking their mail-in ballots for the upcoming March 10 primary. 
Placer County, California declared a local health emergency after reporting a second confirmed case of the virus. The newest case was traced to a Grand Princess cruise ship that had departed San Francisco in mid-February. While the patient had been reported to be “critically ill,” it was later confirmed that the elderly man passed away.
This latest death brings the U.S. official death count to eleven, according to the La Times.
The Grand Princess cruise ship is expected to arrive off the coast of San Francisco on Thursday as the CDC investigates a “small cluster” of coronavirus cases associated with its previous voyage. California’s Governor said in a Wednesday press conference that the ship will be held off the coast and not allowed to dock.
Los Angeles County, California also declared a state of emergency as six new cases of the virus were confirmed on Tuesday night.  
NBC reported that a CDC contractor tasked with screening passengers at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) just tested positive for the virus.
California Governor Newson has now declared a state of emergency for the entire state of California after the state confirmed a total of 53 cases of COVID-19 as of Wednesday afternoon. Newsome said in a statement, “The State of California is deploying every level of government to help identify cases and slow the spread of this coronavirus. This emergency proclamation will help the state further prepare our communities and our health care system in the event it spreads more broadly.”
More than 8,000 people are being monitored in California, according to the Independent.
A New Hampshire hospital worker became the state’s first case on Monday and was ordered to self-isolate. However, the patient who was confirmed to be infected defied orders and instead attended a local event. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement, “The first patient, despite having been directed to self-isolate, attended an invitation-only private event on Friday.” Healthcare works warned all attendees at the event that took place in Vermont to “follow the recommended 14-day self-isolation.”
New Jersey has announced its first COVID-19 case. The patient, a male in his 30s, has been hospitalized since March 3.

And in New York, 1,000 people have been told to self-quarantine following new cases in Westchester, New York.
The U.S military has confirmed two new cases of the virus found in relatives of troops in South Korea. At the same time South Korea has declared what it is calling a “special care zone” around a second city hit by the virus.




The Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China thought to be ground zero for the deadly outbreak of COVID-19 has reportedly been demolished two months after it was shuttered. According to a Lancet study, 66 percent of patients suffering from the virus in Wuhan hospitals as of early January had been exposed to the market. Conflicting reports about the market’s involvement in the outbreak continue to emerge.

In Israel, around 100,000 people are currently in quarantine. During a press conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “We have to understand, we are in the midst of a global epidemic, the most dangerous of these epidemics in the last 100 years.”
Iraq has reported the country’s first two confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the BBC.
As what Germany’s Health Minister Jens Spahn is now calling a “worldwide pandemic” grows, researchers have identified two different strains of the virus. One strain is reportedly less aggressive than the other. According to the study, 30 percent of strains studied were the aggressive type. Researches say the aggressive virus began to decrease in prevalence in early 2020.
China has reported that a 36-year-old recovered COVID-19 patient fell ill five days after recovering and being discharged from the hospital and died. It is unclear which strain of the virus he had.
Panic buying across the world continues as people prepare for possible quarantine and shortages of goods. On Wednesday, Australia’s biggest supermarket chain announced a limit on the amount of toilet paper that could be purchased. Woolworths said, “to ensure more customers have access to the products,” customers would be limited to four packs of toilet paper per person. The chain has also moved hand sanitizers behind the service counter and has placed a limit of two per person.
Across social media, Americans are sharing stories of finding empty store shelves but online retailers are also feeling the stress of panic buying. Amazon Prime Now, Instacart, and Walmart have all been overwhelmed by the increase in orders and are expecting delivery delays. Social media users have reported dousing items they’ve ordering online in products like Lysol before opening.
Amidst the increase in buying, the World Health Organization suggested that contaminated money may be spreading the virus that remains on surfaces for days and suggested people use “contactless payment methods” instead.
Italy’s COVID-19 death toll rose to 79 as the country orders all classrooms throughout the country to close until mid-March. Italy also plans to close theaters and ban public events across the country, according to Yahoo.
Almost 300 million students throughout the world are home from school this week.
Greece is the latest country to close schools and universities as well as cancel large public gatherings.
Despite recording the highest numbers of cases and deaths in the United States, Washington officials have not yet ordered schools to close in the state. King County health officer Jeffrey Duchin acknowledged the need to “keep our society functioning, our businesses functioning and schools functioning.” Duchin said schools in county will close only after there is a confirmed case associated with that school.
However, Facebook Inc. has decided to close its Seattle office after a contractor was diagnosed.

Major U.S. City Declares State of Emergency to Prepare for Coronavirus Outbreak,"“Disruption to everyday life might be severe.”
The city of San Francisco, California, has declared a state of emergency in response to the growing COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. On Tuesday, San Francisco Mayor London Breed announced the city is going to start preparing now as the “global picture is changing rapidly.”
“We see the virus spreading in new parts of the world every day, and we are taking the necessary steps to protect San Franciscans from harm,” Mayor Breed said.

— Mark Matthews (@MarkMatthewsNBC) February 25, 2020

While there have been no confirmed cases in San Francisco, the move comes after a day of press conferences from various agencies that gave mixed messages in regards to recommended responses to the outbreak.
Nancy Messonier, director of the CDC’s National Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a statement:




“As more and more countries experience community spread, successful containment at our borders becomes harder and harder. It’s not a question of if this will happen but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses.”
She added, “disruption to everyday life might be severe.”
The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) recommended taking a more of a “wait and see” approach during their Tuesday press conference.
HHS Secretary Alex Azar said:
“The immediate risk to the general American public remains low, but that has the potential to change quickly.”
“Part of preparedness is an educated population thinking about the future,” he added.
Harvard University epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch has predicted in an interview with the Atlantic that the virus will eventually infect somewhere between 40 and 70 percent of the entire world, because it has now become “uncontainable.” However, Lipsitch does not believe that the virus will be deadly to all of these people because some cases will be mild or asymptomatic.
A case study published this week by Chinese researchers in the journal JAMA has shown that a 20-year-old woman from Wuhan passed the illness on to five of her family members but never became sick herself—so it appears that it possible for someone to transmit the virus without showing symptoms. To make matters even more confusing, the young woman initially tested negative for the illness before testing positive days later.

Coronavirus Update: According To WHO Food Transmission Could Be Possible,"According to the latest report by the World Health Organization (WHO), an investigation has been launched to determine whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be transmitted when food is imported worldwide.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which triggers the COVID-19 virus, could “occur on food worldwide” and “play a potential role of food in the transmission of the virus,” says the recently published WHO management report.
“As a rule, the consumption of raw or uncooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, raw milk or raw animal organs should be handled with care to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked food, ”the organization warns repeatedly.


This follows the reports from Iran, which reports the 18th case within 24 hours, and South Korea, which increases to 204 cases with 2 fatalities. The United States and Australia have also reported an increase in cases with 35 and 19 positive COVID-19 tests, although the strict travel bans have already been tightened.
Outside of China, Italy reported one death, while Iran, Japan and Hong Kong each had two deaths.
Health centers generally advise you to stay at home as much as possible and always pay attention to hand hygiene, especially washing and disinfecting your hands thoroughly. Do not consume raw or undercooked foods. If you have a cold, use common sense and use a mask as a precaution.

Despite unprecedented measures, the corona virus continues to spread in China. What is the pathogen that keeps the world in suspense? The main answers.
Since its appearance in December, the new corona virus 2019-nCoV has been intensively researched. In a number of studies, researchers are gathering knowledge about the risk of infection and genetics, for example. What is known so far – and what is not:
How contagious is the new corona virus?
This question is currently difficult to answer. It is clear that the virus spreads through droplet infection – for example when coughing and speaking. “The pathogen is significantly more infectious than originally thought,” says infection epidemiologist Lars Schaade, Vice President of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI).
According to scientists, the new corona virus is much more contagious than previously thought.
Many details of the infection are still unclear, says virologist Christian Drosten of the Berlin Charité. «This cannot be exactly reconstructed. You probably get the virus similar to how you catch a cold. » Drosten considers it rather unlikely that symptom-free people can also be infectious, as occasionally reported.
According to Chinese doctors, the virus may also spread through the digestive system. They found the pathogen in stool samples after finding that some patients had diarrhea instead of the usual fever. According to RKI information, however, it has not yet been conclusively clarified whether you can actually be infected in this way. According to the information available in China, the virus is also likely to be transmitted from mother to newborn.




What is striking is the discrepancy between the rapid spread in China and the fact that so far only a few people have been infected in other countries. The virologist Thomas Schulz from the Hannover Medical School (MHH) also explains this by saying that the pathogen in China probably circulated weeks before the authorities took rigorous measures. “If you had done this a month earlier, the situation would probably not have escalated so much,” says Schulz.
What are the symptoms of the new corona virus?
The pathogen primarily infects cells of the lower respiratory tract. As a result, some symptoms of a cold, such as runny nose, do not appear to occur. In general, the symptoms of the new lung disease are non-specific. Fever, dry cough and breathing problems can also occur with flu. “It is not enough just to test feverish people,” says Drosten. “Some people only have mild cold symptoms with chills and sore throats.” Sometimes patients can have headaches or diarrhea.
The incubation period – the period between infection and the onset of symptoms – is 2 to 14 days. Therefore, suspected cases are isolated for two weeks. Infection is usually demonstrated by the detection of the genome of the coronavirus in the sputum, the slimy sputum when coughing.
How dangerous is the pathogen?
It is difficult to answer that at the moment. According to current data, the proportion of infected people who die from lung disease in China is around 2 percent – higher than that of the flu. In the flu pandemics of 1957 and 1968, the mortality rate according to Drosten was around 0.1 percent.
The expert explains the high value in China by the fact that mainly serious cases are known there. “Many people in China only report when they are really sick. These cases are not representative. »
“We don’t know the actual number of cases,” says Schaade. Fall mortality is currently lower outside of China. The low death rate is encouraging at first, “but we have to continue to monitor this,” says Schaade.
Clemens Wendtner, who looks after seven infected people at the Munich Clinic Schwabing, assumes that “mortality is significantly less than one percent, more likely even in the alcohol range”. “It doesn’t have much to do with a very, very dangerous illness,” he says.
How can the new lung disease be treated?
There is no special therapy for the disease. Seriously ill patients are treated symptomatically: with antipyretic agents, the therapy of any additional bacterial infections and sometimes mechanical ventilation.
Can the epidemic be stopped with the existing actions?
The coronavirus epidemic will peak in mid to late next week, Zhong Nanshan, chief of the national team of experts in the fight against coronavirus, said Monday. According to German experts, it is difficult to assess whether this is realistic. “I don’t know the Chinese data and models,” says Schulz, but he tends to be skeptical. “At the moment the curve is going up steeply.” Infection epidemiologist Schaade agrees: “I would be very careful with prognoses.”
Drosten adds: “It is crucial whether China manages to stop the transmissions. I can already imagine that. » But there is also a second question, he emphasizes: does the virus take root in countries with poor health systems, such as Africa or Asia, where it can hardly be controlled? Then there is a permanent threat of a new lung disease in the world.
Schulz suspects that the disease in China will decrease with the start of the warmer season – similar to flu and colds.

WHO says virus will ‘soon be in all countries’
The Santa Clara Public Health Department confirmed Friday the nation’s second coronavirus patient with no relevant travel history or clear link to another infected person or at-risk group, indicating that the virus may be spreading undetected in local communities.
“This new case indicates that there is evidence of community transmission but the extent is still not clear,” Dr. Sara Cody, director of the County of Santa Clara Public Health Department, said in a statement Friday. “I understand this may be concerning to hear, but this is what we have been preparing for. Now we need to start taking additional actions to slow down the spread of the disease.”


The new case brings the total number of coronavirus cases in California to 10 and the total number of cases in the U.S. to at least 63.
“We also don’t have any evidence to suggest this case is linked to any other case in California,” Cody told reporters at a press conference. There are two other cases in the county, the health department said. But this one is different because the patient, an elderly woman, doesn’t have a travel history or any known contact with a traveler or infected person.
Cody said local schools should plan for students calling out sick and “explore options for tele-learning and enhance surface cleaning.” She added that the department of public health started conducting a contact investigation after receiving the test results from the woman last night and has been working closely with the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.




“We’re conducting a traditional contact investigation as we do for an infectious disease, which means tracing all the places that the person may have been while infectious,” Cody said. “We are especially concerned about people who might be a high risk contact, like if they were a household member for example,” Cody said.
U.S. health officials confirmed Wednesday the first suspected community transmission case in the U.S. — a resident of Solano County who’s receiving medical care in Sacramento County. A day prior, the city of San Francisco declared a local emergency to prepare for the spread of infections, although there had no recorded cases at the time.
U.S. California Governor Gavin Newsom said Thursday that the state is currently monitoring more than 8,400 people for the coronavirus. He added that California health officials have 200 testing kits on hand and will be receiving more over the next few days.
A bulk of the 63 confirmed cases in the U.S. are people who were evacuated from Wuhan, China or the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined off the coast of Japan.
As of Friday, there have been 4,351 cases and 67 deaths across at least 48 countries outside China, where the outbreak began, WHO Director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters during a press conference.",2020-02-29,https://medicine-today.net/second-us-coronavirus-case-of-unknown-origin-confirmed-in-california-live-updates/
Alarming Study Shows That Humans Can Transmit Coronavirus Without Showing Symptoms Themselves,"Now it’s official: The coronavirus can be spread by people who have no relevant symptoms themselves.
Numerous studies on the virus have been published in the two months since the onset of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. Unfortunately, not all studies have been peer reviewed, and many of them contradict each other. Even those studies that have been reviewed by professionals are still controversial, and it appears that different studies have produced different results. However, numerous case studies in infected patients have shown that containment of the outbreak may be more difficult than previously thought.
A case study published this week by Chinese researchers in JAMA magazine showed that a 20-year-old woman from Wuhan passed the disease on to five of her family members, but she was not sick herself. To make things even more confusing, the young woman was tested negative for the disease before a test days later was finally positive.


A report from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention last week found that around 1.2% of officially confirmed cases in China showed no symptoms.
Meanwhile, more than half of the people who tested positive on the Diamond Princess cruise ship had no symptoms. Indeed, 322 of the 621 people tested showed no symptoms on the cruise ship. This leads many researchers to suspect that there are more asymptomatic cases than we are aware of, as the numbers in the report by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention do not include people who have not gone through the hospital system were.
In a briefing earlier this month, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, suspected that many of the asymptomatic cases will not be covered unless the patient goes to the hospital himself.
“It is obvious that the people included in the numbers of these studies are the ones who introduce themselves in a hospital. However, there is another large group of people who are either asymptomatic or only slightly symptomatic, ”said Fauci.
Doctors believe that the woman from the latest case study had an incubation period of 19 days. Other studies have shown that the incubation period could be up to 24 or even 27 days. Because of the complicated nature of the disease and its symptoms, Harvard University epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch recently predicted that the disease could infect between 40% and 70% of the world’s population.

Harvard Epidemiologist Says Coronavirus Outbreak is Bad—”Thermonuclear Pandemic Level Bad”,"Dr. Feigl-Ding described the outbreak as “thermonuclear pandemic level bad… I’m not exaggerating.”
Harvard public health scientist Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding is describing the current coronavirus outbreak as bad—”thermonuclear pandemic level bad.”
The virus, now known as 2019-nCoV, has killed 82 people, infected almost 3,000 more, and spread to multiple other countries—and Dr. Feigl-Ding has been tweeting about it non-stop since last week. It is the third time since 2003 that a coronavirus has made the jump from animals to humans.


Feigl-Ding, who holds a dual doctorate in epidemiology and nutrition, began by expressing that he is “deeply worried” about the outbreak and indicated that it may be “silently contagious“—a fact that has now been confirmed by China’s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei.
I’ll be honest – as an epidemiologist, I’m really deeply worried about this new coronavirus outbreak. 1) the virus has an upward infection trajectory curve much steeper than SARS. 2) it can be transmitted person to person before symptoms appear — I.e. it is silently contagious! pic.twitter.com/5Kjo6DkbQj
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 23, 2020

On Friday, Dr. Feigl-Ding prefaced his calculations that the reproductive value (R0) of the virus is 3.8 by saying “HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.” Others have estimated that the R0 is 3.3 and 2.6 while the World Health Organization (WHO) has put the R0 somewhere between 1.4 and 2.5
The R0 value, which represents the number of secondary cases which result from every new infection, is the key variable when determining how infectious a virus truly is.
Dr. Feigl-Ding went on to describe the outbreak as “thermonuclear pandemic level bad… I’m not exaggerating.”
“Our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99 percent effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9 percent.”
11/ REFERENCE for the R0 attack rate (reproductive coefficient) of 3.8 and the 99% containment models come from this paper: https://t.co/KrQfuAfS4l
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 25, 2020

Eric Toner, Senior Scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Senior Scientist in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, also expressed during an interview with CNBC that China’s efforts to contain the outbreak are “unlikely to be effective.”

Researchers in the U.K. have estimated that only 5.1 percent of cases in Wuhan have been identified.
3/ … We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by 21 January a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan….
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 25, 2020





As rumors and misinformation about the virus, the outbreak, the true conditions in China, and even simulations that took place months prior, Dr. has come under harsh criticism for his tweets. However, the epidemiologist contends he is not “trying to incite fear.”
Some folks think I’m trying to incite fear. I’m not trying—I’m a scientist. This #coronavirus #WuhanCoronovirus is serious. Over 50 million people are quarantined + case counts will go up much more. Predict @WHO will declare emergency. Let’s hope for the best, prepared for worst. https://t.co/H3UcR9eAjs
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 25, 2020

It is important to remember that the above estimates are just that and are based on assumptions amidst a rapidly changing situation that could continue to change in various and even unknown ways without a moment’s notice. While it currently appears that 2019-nCoV is far more infectious than previously known coronaviruses and may be on par with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed 20 to 50 million people around the world, it may switch gears at any time. However, the R0 value for the Spanish flu was a mere 1.8, so even if the estimates putting 2019-nCoV’s R0 value closer to 2.8 are more accurate, it’s “still super bad.”
14/ Let’s pretend the 3.8 estimate is too high (there’s unpublished estimates of 2.5). even if this virus’s R0=2.5, that’s still 2x higher than seasonal flu’s 1.28 (ref above), and higher than 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic of 1.80 that killed millions. So 2.8 is still super bad folks
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 25, 2020

On Monday, Feigl-Ding touched on and attempted to clarify the conflicting R0 estimates:
5) CONFLICTING R0 NUMBERS: Lots of conflicting reports of Wuhan #coronarovirus R0 (reproductive number) — not all the R0 estimates are the same! The @MRC_Outbreak’s R0=2.6 is the most reliable since they used WHO data as @WHO research center. Most other used generic online data.
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 27, 2020

In Dr. Feigl-Ding’s latest tweets he calls on the WHO to “finally” declare an emergency.
8) Overwhelming #coronavirus data suggests: A- High R0 between 2.6-2.9 (best sources). B- Has “higher pandemic risk than SARS”. C- Contagious even w/out symptoms (unlike SARS). D- Cases increasing rapidly overseas. E- Countries need time to prepare. @WHO needs to declare🚨 now!
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 27, 2020

UPDATE 4:55pm EST — On Monday, the WHO “admitted an error” in assessing the risk of the coronavirus. A Sunday night situation report listed the risk as “very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level,” according to the AFP. The WHO admits that the agency “incorrectly” listed the global risk as moderate in reports on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.
