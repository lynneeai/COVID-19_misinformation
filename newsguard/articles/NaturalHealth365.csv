Vitamin C infusion for the treatment of severe 2019-nCoV infected pneumonia,"(NaturalHealth365) As public health officials all over the world desperately scramble to deal with the cold, pneumonia and flu season, doctors in Wuhan are using a not-so-novel treatment to combat the current coronavirus outbreak: vitamin C infusion therapy.
According to latest coronavirus updates (the “official” updates, anyway), there are over 78,000 confirmed worldwide cases of 2019-nCoV and almost 2,500 people have lost their lives to this deadly virus.  In China as many as 150 million people (about 10 percent of the population) are facing lockdown, and half are facing travel restrictions.
Yet, in the face of such social upheaval and uncertainty, could something as simple – yet as powerful – as  ascorbic acid be an answer to the 2019-nCoV epidemic?
A natural way to wipe out the threat of pneumonia
Over 2 years ago, NaturalHealth365 reported on a study out of New Zealand which found that critically ill patients had catastrophically low levels of vitamin C – even if they were supplemented with the “recommended daily intake” of around  65 to 90 milligrams.  Keep in mind, most integrative healthcare providers think that amount is way too low for maintaining optimal health.
In line with other evidence – some that dates as far back as the 1970s, when high-dose vitamin C was provided as a natural treatment for patients with cancer – the authors of the study suggested that these extremely low levels developed because the sick patients’ bodies were drawing heavily on vitamin C stores in order to fight the massive infections and inflammation their bodies were dealing with.
Among its many health benefits, vitamin C is a powerful anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant agent … and these patients’ critical illnesses were depleting them of this critical nutrient.

Because of their findings, the researchers suggested that critically ill individuals may need as much as 3 grams (or 3,000 milligrams) of ascorbic acid per day, well over the recommended (conventional) “upper limit” of 2,000 mg and far more than most patients would normally receive in a hospitalized setting.
Yet, delivering this vitamin intravenously would likely prove more beneficial because it could increase the circulating levels of vitamin C more readily and with fewer side effects.
Now, we’re seeing the same logic being brought to the battle against 2019-nCoV.
New clinical trial in China poised to offer relief to people suffering from coronavirus
According to the U.S. National Library of Medicine, China is currently conducting a clinical trial involving a whopping 24,000 mg/day of intravenous vitamin C delivered to patients suffering from a coronavirus-related acute respiratory ailment known as severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). They will receive it for seven days straight at the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University.
In their study description, the researchers mention that vitamin C is known to prevent and reduce the duration of the common cold, and that a deficiency in this vitamin has also been linked with an increased risk of pneumonia and flu. They also note that in severe infection processes, white blood cells can “accumulate in the lungs, destroying alveolar capillaries. Early clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent this process.”
The authors are hopeful that high-dose vitamin C infusion will reverse the fluid overload and vascular injury that has been happening so aggressively in their patients who acquired SARI after becoming infected by 2019-nCoV.
We look forward to hearing how this high-dose vitamin C therapy will impact those suffering with pneumonia.

Coronavirus solution: Shanghai government recommends vitamin C for COVID-19,"(NaturalHealth365) Remember the other day, we reported on three clinical trials being done in China to see how vitamin C would affect coronavirus patients?  Well, it’s official: the government of Shanghai, China is openly admitting that vitamin C is helping to reduce the symptoms experienced by coronavirus patients.
Naturally, we all know that pharmaceutical interests – here in the United States – will never popularize this “action step” in the face of a growing (viral) health crisis.  They would rather focus on the possibility of greater restrictions on personal freedom, quarantines, and (of course) the need for vaccine development.  Fear mongering and maintaining a strong support of (toxic) drug usage seems to be the only areas of interest for conventionally-trained sick care “professionals.”
But, today, we release an official announcement from the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service that we hope will be shared far and wide.
Shanghai Government Officially Recommends Vitamin C for COVID-19
Written by Andrew W. Saul
(OMNS Mar 3, 2020) The government of Shanghai, China has announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C. (1) Dosage recommendations vary with severity of illness, from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 200 mg/kg/day.
These dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV.  This specific method of administration is important, says intravenous therapy expert Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, because vitamin C’s effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally. Dr. Yanagisawa is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy. He says, “Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.”
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, a Chinese-American specialist physician, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities throughout China. He has been instrumental in facilitating at least three Chinese clinical IV vitamin C studies now underway. Dr. Cheng is presently in Shanghai continuing his efforts to encourage still more Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy incorporating high oral doses as well as C by IV.
Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa both recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19 infection.
An official statement from Xi’an Jiaotong University Second Hospital (2) reads:
“On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).”
Why do U.S. media outlets continue to ignore the positive effects of vitamin C?
The answer is obvious.  Time and again, whenever a safe and effective (natural) remedy is presented for a particular illness or condition – it’s immediately marginalized or “discredited.”  And, we’re always reminded to “follow the (drug) advice” of our doctors.  This is all about pharmaceutical industry control over our sick care system.
But, instead of getting angry, we – at NaturalHealth365 – strongly encourage all of our readers to seek out more information that will empower you to make informed decisions about your own health.
By the way, I (personally) do not routinely get IV vitamin C treatments.  But, if I were infected with the coronavirus – I would immediately get it done.
My “normal” routine is to mix vitamin C powder with water or my greens drink – every morning and some more C throughout the day, depending on how I feel.  In addition, as an added immune system boost, I take 1 – 2 teaspoons of liposomal vitamin C for increased absorption into my cells.
Please note: this is just my personal routine.  Everyone has a unique situation and, if you’re not feeling well, you should always seek out the guidance of a well-trained, experienced (integrative) healthcare provider.
Don’t forget, a strong immune system is the ultimate defense against any dis-ease – especially the threat of bacterial or viral infections.  Stay well hydrated, get a good amount of rest, keep physically active, eat well (organic fresh food, as much as possible) and be sure to take plenty of vitamin C – every day.
Stay tuned to NaturalHealth365 for more updates on the coronavirus, as more information becomes available.

Coronavirus UPDATE: The effectiveness of a face mask,"(NaturalHealth365) The novel coronavirus, generally known as COVID-19, has taken the world by storm since it began infecting people in Wuhan, China back in December 2019.  We see people wearing a face mask … the frantic purchasing of extra food, household essentials and nutritional supplements … plus a heightened sense of fear about the future.
The death rate from this virus continues to rise, thousands are suffering from related upper respiratory infections and respiratory distress, and even the stock market has been thrust into a nose dive.  We’re all left with questions, including this one: Do face masks really work as a “first line” of defense?
The answer to this isn’t as straightforward as you may think. And unfortunately, the United States and other nations around the world are now facing a face mask shortage, since so many people are buying them and so many shipments from Asian-based manufacturers simply aren’t being sent out – and officials are saying this could have a dire impact.
Surgeon General “Logic:” If the American public doesn’t stop buying face masks, our community could be at even GREATER risk of coronavirus epidemic
According to a February 2020 paper published in International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, the virus formerly known as COVID-19 has now been renamed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2.  COVID-19 is now officially recognized as the upper respiratory infection caused by the virus. This is similar to how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
Since the virus which causes COVID-19 spreads primarily through the air (in the form of droplets from an infected person’s mouth or nose after coughing or sneezing), people have naturally been trying to stock up face masks to reduce their risk of infection.
There are some serious problems with this. First, and as reported by LiveScience, many disease experts point out that regular masks may not be made of the right kind of material to fully stop SARS-CoV-2 from entering a person’s mouth and nose, especially if the mask is worn incorrectly. In fact, the U.S. Surgeon General recently warned that improperly wearing and handling face masks may actually increase a person’s risk of the disease.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.
Get the BEST indoor air purification system - at the LOWEST price, exclusively for NaturalHealth365 readers.  I, personally use this system in my home AND office.  Click HERE to order now - before the sale ends.
Additionally, the growing shortage of face masks threatens to leave healthcare providers without enough personal protective equipment to use while working with sick patients. This is a huge problem, argues the Surgeon General and others, because if providers working directly with infected patients aren’t adequately protected, the spread of the virus into the community could be accelerated.
And as COVID-19 has “officially” reached a pandemic level, U.S. healthcare workers will need upwards of 3.5 billion face masks – but, the nation only has about 1% of this number at the moment.
So, what’s the bottom line? Face masks can work against something like SARS-CoV-2, but they’re not a 100% guarantee – and they may just give people a false sense of hope that distracts them from taking other necessary steps to reduce their risk of exposure.
Unless you yourself are showing signs of an illness or if you’re around someone who is, you likely don’t need one – at the moment.  But, you should definitely focus on supporting a healthy immune system.
Eat fresh (organic – as much as possible) foods, take high quality nutritional supplements like vitamin C and D, get an adequate amount of rest – every night, maintain a physically active lifestyle, avoid (overly) stressful situations, keep your indoor air space clean with a quality air purifier and avoid the use of toxic (immune suppressing) chemicals for household or personal use.
In case you already bought face masks, here’s how to use it properly
If you are going to wear a face mask – whether that’s a typical surgical mask or a heavier duty N95 respirator – at least be sure to take these precautions to increase their effectiveness:
Clean and sanitize your hands first BEFORE and AFTER touching your mask.
Make sure the stiff upper edge of the surgical mask is pinched securely against the bridge of your nose, and that the bottom of the mask covers your mouth and chin.
Avoid touching the mask while wearing it, and never touch the front of the mask. The front of the mask is considered contaminated. You should only touch the loops that go around your ears.
Instead of or in addition to face masks, follow these other (common sense) tips to stay safe from harm: avoid large crowds for the near future – until things calm down, wash your hands – on a regular basis throughout the day with soap and hot water and (again) be sure you do all you can to keep your immune system healthy and strong.

Oil of oregano is a natural antibiotic and anti-fungal remedy,"(NaturalHealth365) Western medicine relies heavily on antibiotics to treat diseases – and sometimes these drugs are truly needed. But the rise of antibiotic-resistant “superbugs” – along with the serious side effects that can accompany antibiotic use – has triggered an urgent search for naturally-sourced substances, like oil of oregano, to kill pathogens safely and effectively.
Now, recently-published research is revealing the potential of a familiar Mediterranean cooking herb to do just that.  And, the results are stunning.
Oregano oil has potent effects against Candida albicans
A member of the mint family, oregano is scientifically known as origanum vulgare L. The name “oregano” derives from the Greek words for “mountain” and “joy” – and oregano certainly seems to be bringing joy to researchers when it comes to its surprising antimicrobial properties.
In a study conducted at Georgetown University Medical Center and published in Molecular and Cellular Biology, the research team investigated the ability of essential oil of oregano to kill Candida albicans, a fungal yeast overgrowth that can cause joint pain, exhaustion, and digestive problems.
What they found was amazing: at concentrations of .25 mg/ml, the wild oregano oil – a blend known as P73 — completely inhibited both the germination and the mycelial growth of C. albicans in cultures.
Researchers also tested the ability of P73 to treat C. albicans in infected mice, administering a mixture of oregano oil and olive oil – the latter used as a “vehicle.” They found that 80 percent of the oregano-treated mice survived – while mice given only olive oil all died within ten days.

The team credited oil of oregano with “potent’ antifungal effects against C. albicans.
Oil of oregano combats dangerous bacteria and viruses
In a 2012 study, researchers found that oregano essential oil inhibited the growth of 20 different clinical bacterial strains of E. coli – which can cause severe gastrointestinal problems, anemia and even kidney failure – and 20 strains of P. aeruginosa, which can cause ear infections, skin rashes and pneumonia.
The encouraging results led researchers to call for further study on oregano oil as an alternative antibacterial remedy – and to explore its use as an “effective means for the prevention of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.”
And there’s more.
Additional studies have shown that oil of oregano kills at least 30 different strains of disease-causing bacteria – including staphylococcus aureus, the leading cause of skin and soft tissue infections – along with coronavirus, a primary cause of the common cold, as well as a cause of pneumonia and other respiratory infections.
In addition, oil of oregano kills the H. pylori bacterium – a contributory factor in 90 percent of all duodenal ulcers and 80 percent of all gastric ulcers.
What makes this all-natural oil so potent?
Oregano’s two most formidable weapons are a pair of volatile oils, thymol and carvacrol. Carvacrol has also been studied for its therapeutic effects, and a 2016 study published in European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences showed that carvacrol from oregano oil protected against methotrexate toxicity in rats.
Other constituents in oregano include various flavonoids, along with essential vitamins and minerals – including iron, manganese, vitamin E, tryptophan and omega-3 fatty acids. Oregano also contains ursolic acid, a powerful antioxidant and antibacterial agent in its own right.
Even MRSA is no match for oil of oregano
The World Health Organization has classified the advent of “superbugs” as a global public health crisis. Currently, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus – or MRSA – strikes 80,000 people and claims over 11,000 lives worldwide every year.
But the news on oregano oil just keeps getting better, with a team of British and Indian researchers reporting that essential oil of Himalayan oregano – simply, oreganum vulgare that happens to grow in the Himalayas – is effective against the MRSA pathogen.
According to researcher Professor Vyv Salisbury, the essential oil kills MRSA at a dilution of 1 to 1,000. The oil kills MRSA both as a liquid and a vapor, with the antimicrobial ability undiminished by heating in boiling water.
Plans are underway to develop an oregano-based soap to be used in hospitals, both for washing of hands and disinfecting surfaces.
How should I take essential oil of oregano?
P73 oil of oregano is available in capsule form.
Naturopaths and herbal healers advise essential oil of oregano for colds, flu, sinusitis and other respiratory illnesses, as well as for candida and yeast infections.
It can also be used for duodenal and gastric ulcers – in conjunction with other medications that target H. pylori – and, when mixed with coconut oil, can be used topically for athletes’ foot and ringworm.
Because oil of oregano is so potent, you should only use it under the guidance of your trusted naturopathic physician, who can advise the correct dosage for you.  Some experts say oil of oregano should be diluted with water or mixed with coconut oil – and not taken internally for more than two weeks.
Because oregano oil is such an effective antibacterial agent, long-term use can deplete levels of friendly gut bacteria. So it’s wise to make sure you consume sufficient amounts of probiotic foods – such as live-cultured yogurt, miso soup or sauerkraut – along with prebiotic foods such as garlic, onion and raw asparagus.

"New strain of coronavirus currently “as deadly as the Spanish flu epidemic,” expert warns","(NaturalHealth365) One look at the harrowing images coming out of China is enough to leave all of us with the same question on our minds: what is coronavirus?
A mysterious, pneumonia-like illness is spreading around the world, and experts are anticipating this epidemic to be “as deadly as the Spanish flu epidemic” of 1918, which killed an astounding 50 million people.  Stick with us to learn more about this worrisome disease and why you should consider natural remedies like vitamin C and vitamin D as part of your family’s virus prevention plan.
World Health Organization: Wuhan coronavirus epidemic poses a “high” global threat level
In late December 2019, the first cases of a strange and potentially deadly pneumonia-like illness were diagnosed in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. The illnesses – signs of which include fever, cough, breathing trouble, and sudden fainting and collapse – were found to be caused by a mutating strain of a virus called coronavirus, or 2019-nCoV. Its origin is hypothesized to be from a wet market in the Asian city of 11 million.
As of this writing, the death toll from 2019-nCoV has climbed to over 300 people, with 14,000 plus confirmed cases in at least 19 countries, including Australia, Cambodia, Philippines, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Tibet, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and Vietnam (for real-time updates, check out this resource).
Just note: “Official” numbers are always downplayed for obvious business reasons.
In a heavily criticized move, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently stopped short of declaring this outbreak an international health emergency.  Had they done so, it would be easier for global leaders to launch a concerted effort to prevent an epidemic. Failure to declare an emergency may delay care and put even more global citizens in the path of this potentially deadly illness.

Only time will still tell if the international agency will change their stance on the severity of the outbreak. In the meantime, the WHO has conceded that they made a mistake in its risk assessment of the mysterious illness, and have upgraded the threat level from “moderate” to “high” at both the regional and global level (including “very high” in China).
Protect yourself and your loved ones from the flu with these 3 natural remedies
Reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that deaths from seasonal flu-like illnesses are increasing, and have been for some time. With the outbreak of this new mutating virus, it seems more important than ever to protect yourself and your loved ones from illnesses.
Here are 3 ways to keep your immune system health and strong:
Take vitamin C: We know that a vitamin C deficiency has been linked to pneumonia.  On the flip side, getting a sufficient amount of vitamin C can boost immune health and may help people avoid falling ill with flu-like illnesses.  It’s no surprise that the Cebu City Health Office of the Phillipines recently advised people (after the arrival of a 5-year-old boy into the country who tested positive for coronavirus) to take vitamin C.  According to Mayo Clinic, the recommended daily intake of vitamin C for adults is about 65 to 90 milligrams (mg) a day.  But, that’s way too low to help avoid the threat of viral infections.  In many cases, supplementation is a must … but, foods rich in vitamin C include kale, broccoli, peppers, kiwifruit, and citrus.
Take vitamin D: Studies, including a 2017 study published in BMJ, show that vitamin D supplements can bolster people against colds, flus, and other types of respiratory infections. It’s understood – by many integrative healthcare providers – that vitamin D boosts the levels of antimicrobial substances in the lungs called antimicrobial peptides.  The minimum recommended intake for vitamin D is around 400 – 800 International Units (IU) per day, but most studies show that increasing your intake to 1,000 to 2,000 IU/day (or more) is safe and beneficial.  Keep in mind, to get the best absorption rate, it’s best to take a vitamin D supplement that offers the essential cofactors such as, vitamin K2, boron, zinc and magnesium – to name a few.  In addition, foods rich in vitamin D include wild-caught fatty fish and pasture-raised (organic) eggs.
Get enough sleep: Even just one night of sleep deprivation – getting less than the recommended 6 – 8 hours – has been shown to lower a person’s immune function and increase their risk of falling ill with a communicable disease.  To avoid the threat of viral infections, make a commitment with your loved ones that you’ll all prioritize your sleep and practice good sleep hygiene techniques.
Obviously, it’s always a good idea to minimize your exposure to toxic chemicals, unwanted amounts of mental and emotional stress and eat an organic diet rich in antioxidants to support a strong immune system.
The Wuhan coronavirus outbreak is an actively developing story. Stay tuned for future updates on this flu-like epidemic and other major health news at NaturalHealth365.

Homemade hand sanitizer – without toxic ingredients – effective against COVID-19,"(NaturalHealth365) If you’ve ventured out to the local stores lately, you’ve probably already found that hand sanitizer is in short supply – due to the COVID-19 outbreak.  That is … if you can find any at all!
Of course, that’s not entirely “bad” news.  Many hand sanitizers contain chemicals linked to human health issues.  Today, we’ll focus on a better way to stay safe, especially during these challenging times.
A recent Microsoft News article reported that the Singapore Prime Minister’s wife had been closely monitoring the coronavirus pandemic and sharing information and findings via social media. Recently, Ms. Ho shared that using mild, natural disinfectants like lime, lemon, or vinegar also proves effective at killing viruses and bacteria.
Natural disinfectants that tend to kill viruses
Ms. Ho went on to note that coronaviruses tend to be fragile. They are quite easy to destroy because the only defense they have is their outer membrane. As soon as that outer membrane is disrupted, the virus can no longer infect.
Of course, studies back up the use of ingredients like vinegar, lemon, and lime as disinfects, too. One study discovered that vinegar was as effective as many of the top commercial disinfectants when it came to killing bacteria.
Another proved that vinegar did a great job at eliminating the flu virus, too. A more recent study found that vinegar even killed off tuberculosis, which is extremely hard to kill. Scientists noted that if vinegar can kill tuberculosis, it will likely kill off most other types of bacteria, too.

2-ingredient hand sanitizer recipe that’s effective against COVID-19
Even if you didn’t score any hand sanitizer at the store, you can make your own at home with just two ingredients. And it doesn’t include any harsh chemicals that could be a hazard to your health.
All you’ll need is some apple cider vinegar (although you can use any type of vinegar except sweet vinegars), aloe vera gel, and a clean spray bottle. If you don’t love the smell, simply add a few drops of essential oils like peppermint, lemon, or lavender.
Of course, as you use it more, you’ll get used to the smell of vinegar over time.
To make this hand sanitizer recipe, combine your aloe and vinegar in a 2:1 ratio, which means two parts of aloe and one part of vinegar. Mix thoroughly until combined. Store it in a spray bottle.
Along with using it as a hand sanitizer, it can be used to sanitize surfaces, baby toys, and nearly anything else around your home as well to kill bacteria and viruses.

3 of the healthiest fruits in the world,"(NaturalHealth365.com) Vegetables and fruits have unique phytonutrient profiles that have helped them to survive, withstand storms and predators plus disease.  In fact, phytonutrients are the key compounds used by plants to ward off all kinds of threats to their system.
For example, some plants develop a bitter taste to ward off munching insects. Eating plenty of phytonutrients is one way that humans can piggyback off of plants’ defensive compounds and become more resistant to threats to our system such as illness, injury, and infection.
Vegetables versus fruits: Do you know the difference? 
Did you know that bell peppers are actually fruits?  So are pumpkins, tomatoes, string beans, eggplants, and many more foods you might have thought were vegetables.
A fruit is a seed-bearing structure that develops from the ovary of a flowering plant, whereas vegetables are all other plant parts, such as roots, leaves and stems.  According to this definition of fruits then, here are three of the healthiest, most nutrient-dense ones you can eat.
A smart way to protect yourself from harmful pollutants
One large red bell pepper contains 349% of your RDI for vitamin C. We really cannot get enough of this powerful antioxidant, especially as it relates to the coronavirus.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

First, we cannot absorb iron without enough vitamin C in our system.  Secondly, we cannot manufacture collagen without it.  This is a major reason why smokers begin to look older faster – smoking depletes vitamin C in the body, causing a decline in collagen synthesis.
All this vitamin C in red bell peppers helps to protect us from free radical damage – the slings and arrows in our environment caused by toxins that damage our cells and alter DNA in ways that can cause cancer. Antioxidants also protect us against sun damage and help preserve our eye health.
Red bell peppers are also rich in a phytonutrient and antioxidant called lycopene – which helps in the prevention of many cancers, especially lung and prostate cancers. Red bell peppers are also very high in vitamins B6 and contain 100% of our RDI for vitamin A, which is so important for our eyes, along with lutein and, zeaxanthin, two important phytonutrients for the eyes (but not as much as orange peppers).
Consume them with grass-fed butter or make a salad dressing with extra virgin olive oil to make sure you absorb all this fat-soluble vitamin A.
A delicious way to keep your eyes and skin healthy 
Pumpkins are one of the healthiest fruits around. Even their seeds and the pure essential oils extracted from them have powerful nutrients and constituents which have so many benefits for health.
One cup of cooked pumpkin contains 245% of eye-nourishing vitamin A, 19% of the RDI for vitamin C, and nearly 1/5th of our daily requirement for hard-to-get potassium, 10% of our vitamin E needs, and 11% of our RDI for B6 and magnesium.
Pumpkin is especially good for the eyes, as many orange-colored vegetables are.  It is rich in phytonutrients like beta carotene and is one of our richest sources of lutein – both of which help protect us against age-related macular degeneration.
Being so rich in vitamins A, E, and C, it’s wonderful for the skin as well, helping promote collagen synthesis.  For this reason, it would be wise to add pumpkin to a vegetable stew to really promote collagen synthesis.
Super prostate and digestive system protection
Grapefruit is not only rich in vitamins A and C, it also contains an abundance of antioxidants like lycopene and limonene that are powerhouse cancer-fighters. Again, lycopene is a phytonutrient carotenoid and pink grapefruit (not white) is one fruit (along with lycopene-rich tomatoes, apricots, pink grapefruit, watermelon, papaya, and guava), that have proven to help reduce men’s risk of developing prostate cancer.
In a recent study of 130 male prostate cancer patients and 274 male control patients, those consuming the most lycopene-rich green tea and eating the most lycopene-rich produce had an 86% reduced risk of prostate cancer.
So, as you can see, the power of good nutrition should never be underestimated.

“Greater than SARS:” Death toll of coronavirus surges in China and the world is watching,"(NaturalHealth365) As promised, we’re doing our best over the coming weeks and months to keep our readers up-to-date on the latest news about the coronavirus epidemic.  Conventionally speaking, they will tell you that this virus originated from a live animal / seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province of central China.  But, many experts – including Dr. Francis Boyle, an international law professor at the University of Illinois (with 3 degrees from Harvard University) strongly believe that this virus is a byproduct of biological warfare weapon research.
Whatever you believe, there’s no doubt that the coronavirus has quickly spread across the globe, infecting individuals from at least 24 countries, including the United States.
In today’s article, we’re rounding up some of the latest news about the coronavirus, dubbed 2019-nCoV, and offering some practical tips to help you and your loved ones stay safe from harm.
WHO: Coronavirus now officially a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern”
Following suit of the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar has officially declared the coronavirus a public health emergency. The declaration is retroactive to January 27 of this year. The declaration affords state, tribal, and local departments the ability to re-allocate personnel and resources to fund measures like public health information campaigns. Azar’s declaration also greenlights HHS representatives to collaborate with research and pharmacology industries in order to develop vaccines and therapeutic interventions to fight against the spreading 2019-nCoV illness.
Public health officials are now ordering any U.S. citizens returning from the center of the epidemic in China to enter quarantine for two weeks “as a precaution.”  However, travel to and from areas of origin and outbreak is becoming increasingly prohibited, and an estimated 56 million people in China are essentially on lockdown.
Scientists are investigating genomic sequences of the virus sampled from more than 50 infected people in an attempt to figure out 2019-nCoV’s origins, its mode of mutation, and how it may be stopped. According to a February 2 article from Business Insider, a team of Thai doctors have allegedly been using a cocktail of seasonal flu and HIV drugs to combat the novel coronavirus.
Rumors have it that public health organizations and other groups such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation predicted that 65 million+ people would perish in the 2019-nCoV outbreak.  
As February 3, the WHO reports a total of 17,391 confirmed cases in 24 countries, with 2,838 new cases confirmed in just 24 hours (other resources are reporting as many as 19,700 cases). WHO also reports 362 deaths, all but one of them occurring China. The infection is reportedly more widespread than the 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak which also originated in the major Asian country.
And according to a Feb. 3 news report from CBS, there are presently 11 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States: six in California, one in Washington state, one in Arizona, two in Illinois, and one in Massachusetts.
Travelers ALERT: Understanding the signs and symptoms of infection
It’s not totally clear what the incubation period for the new coronavirus is, but experts estimate that it could be as long as 14 days. This means that a person could be exposed to the coronavirus, infected by it, and then show no symptoms for as long as two weeks – but, still expose other people to the virus in the meantime.
It’s important to always be vigilant about signs and symptoms of flu and colds this time of year, but taking some extra notice right now is prudent. The fever, cough, chills, respiratory problems that can occur aren’t unique to this new strain of coronavirus, but if you notice these in yourself or your loved one, consider visiting with an integrative physician – especially if you or anyone you know has been traveling recently.
In addition, practice “common sense” when it comes to protecting yourself from infection: practice excellent hand hygiene, stay well-hydrated, and strengthen your immune system by maintaining adequate levels of vitamin C and D.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

"Preventing viral infections and disease with glutathione, research reveals","(NaturalHealth365) Glutathione, also known as the body’s “master antioxidant,” is so closely tied to health and survival that scientists can predict longevity – or lack of it – merely by measuring levels in the body. Now, with a growing concern over the emerging coronavirus pandemic, a peer-reviewed scientific study highlighting the role of glutathione in overcoming viral diseases is an important discovery, to say the least!
Can glutathione really hold the key to preventing viral infection?  While more research remains to be done, scientists agree that glutathione can boost the immune system while reducing the oxidative damage and inflammation that accompanies influenza and other viral infections.
Glutathione offers potent immune system support
Glutathione performs a host of life-sustaining functions in the body.  By scavenging harmful free radicals, this versatile enzyme helps to reduce disease-causing and tissue-damaging oxidative stress.
In a randomized, double-blind study recently published in European Journal of Nutrition, researchers found that 1,000 mg of supplemental glutathione per day decreased oxidative stress by a very significant 17 percent.
In addition, research has shown that glutathione increases the production and activity of T-cells – which trigger the immune system to attack invaders – and of phagocytes and lymphocytes, which devour any foreign body or pathogen they may encounter.
Clearly, by boosting the production of these infection-fighting white blood cells, your immune system will get a boost in fighting dis-ease.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

This hard-working antioxidant also helps to detoxify and neutralize a host of internal and external toxins – including alcohol, medications, chemicals, carcinogens, environmental pollutants, radiation and metabolic waste.
In other words: if a substance is in your body and it is harmful to your health, glutathione will soon be hot on its trail and ready to neutralize and hustle it away – with no questions asked.  And, finally, glutathione helps to repair cell DNA, thereby preventing cancer-causing mutations – while helping to recycle other important antioxidants such as vitamin C and vitamin E.
Warning: Antioxidant shortages can lead to life-threatening outcomes
What happens when glutathione levels fall too low?  Many studies show that deficiencies can impair immune system function, increase vulnerability to pathogens, and lead to the cellular damage and oxidative stress that triggers disease.
For example, one peer-reviewed, published study showed that a deficiency raises the risk of heart attack by a substantial 30 percent.  A separate study demonstrated that patients with the hepatitis B virus had significantly lower levels of glutathione when compared to a healthy group of volunteers.
In fact, noted health practitioner and acupuncturist Dr. Mark Sircus asserts that low levels are associated with 74 different conditions and diseases.  Some physicians – including Dr. Mark Hyman, the Medical Director at the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Functional Medicine – go even farther.
Dr. Hyman insists that “virtually all” patients suffering from chronic degenerative disease (including cancer, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, autoimmune disease and Alzheimer’s disease) are deficient in glutathione.
Study: Supplementation of a powerful antioxidant can inhibit viral production
In one intriguing study, researchers explored the impact of glutathione on the pathogenesis of dengue fever, a tropical viral disease.
In research published in Biochemical and Biophysicial Research Communications, scientists found that infection with dengue virus resulted in a decrease in intracellular glutathione – which in turn caused virus production to increase.
The team found that when levels were raised through supplementation, there was a decrease in production of the virus – while helping to regulate the immune response by inhibiting a process known as NF-kB activation.
These promising results come as no surprise to Dr. Sircus, who has long maintained that glutathione can protect against a variety of viruses, including herpes, influenza – and possibly the deadly Ebola virus as well.
Raise your levels of this “master antioxidant” with natural techniques
Unfortunately, a wide variety of factors can deplete precious stores of glutathione.  These issues include the use of pharmaceutical drugs, poor nutrition, exposure to environmental toxins, physical and emotional stress, infections, injuries and the normal process of aging.
Natural health experts say that the best way to replenish low glutathione levels may be to consume foods rich in the three glutathione “building blocks” – glutamine, glycine and cysteine.
Foods high in sulfur – including onions and garlic, as well as cruciferous vegetables like kale, broccoli and cabbage – are important for the production of cysteine, which is particularly vital for glutathione production.
Fruits and vegetables rich in vitamin C – such as strawberries, kiwi, camu camu and red peppers – and vitamin E, including almonds, spinach and sunflower seeds, can also help replenish the body’s stores of glutathione.  Naturally, all your food should be organic (chemical free) – as much as possible.
And, you can boost glutathione synthesis with natural supplements and nutrients – including milk thistle, alpha lipoic acid, the “sleep” hormone melatonin and the antioxidant mineral selenium.
If you do decide to try oral supplementation, liposomal glutathione is believed to be the most bioavailable formulation.  Of course, check first with your integrative doctor before adding any new supplements to your health routine.
In conclusion, with the coronavirus on the verge of being declared a worldwide pandemic, the news about how antioxidants can offer antiviral potential is both timely and important.

Can Zinc help you AVOID problems with COVID-19?,"(NaturalHealth365) While other minerals often get all the glory, zinc often goes unnoticed, yet it’s essential to healthy immune function.  Zinc is a critical part of many bodily processes and a deficiency in this mineral can result in many health problems, such as chronic fatigue, high cholesterol, osteoporosis, hair loss, and a compromised immune system.
Along with its long list of health benefits, zinc also shows promise in helping you avoid problems with COVID-19.  For example, in a recent YouTube video, Roger Seheult, MD, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist delves into some data from South Korea and whether intracellular zinc may be able to help prevent COVID-19.
The video looks closely at a study done on the way zinc inhibits coronavirus – specifically SARS-CoV – and arterivirus, and offers some insight on how zinc may also help fight COVID-19.
Zinc has the potential to block virus replication
According to the study published in PLOS Pathogens back in 2010, zinc worked to inhibit coronavirus RNA polymerase activity. What this does is block RNA synthesis, which means that the virus isn’t able to keep replicating.
Basically, by blocking replication of the virus, it slows the virus down. Since SARS-CoV is very similar to what we see in COVID-19 (they are both types of coronavirus), it’s very likely that zinc works in the same way on COVID-19, slowing down the replication of this virus.
Of course, it’s essential to note that it’s intracellular zinc, zinc that’s inside of your cells, that can block virus replication. This means that popping a few zinc lozenges may not help you.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

There’s currently no evidence to show that taking zinc orally will increase your intracellular zinc. However, if you’re zinc deficient, it stands to reason that your intracellular levels would also be low, so boosting zinc intake is definitely worth pursuing.
So, if you’re concerned about COVID-19 … talk to your integrative physician (today) about the proper amount of zinc that’s best for you.  And, here’s a reference from the NIH for RDA levels and good food sources of zinc.
Liposome technology offers a way to effectively get zinc into the cells
So how do you get zinc into your cells to boost intracellular zinc levels?
Liposome technology is the answer.  The liposomal delivery technology involves making tiny fatty acid bubbles (submicroscopic) that are called liposomes, and those liposomes can be used to encapsulate substances such as zinc.  Liposomal products fuse with your cell membranes to ensure efficient intracellular delivery.
When you swallow these liposomes with zinc (or any other nutrient), they’re absorbed directly and transported to where needed.  Then they fuse with your cells, releasing the supplement right in through the cell membrane.
Keep in mind, when choosing a liposome product, it’s essential to look for those with small liposomes – those between 50-120 nanometers are the most effective. You’ll also want to look for brands that use plant-sourced lipids, which are the most beneficial and stable for your body.

Breaking NEWS: Can quercetin help us to avoid the threat of coronavirus infection?,"(NaturalHealth365) As COVID-19 continues its march across the globe – and officials warn of a “tsunami” of newly-diagnosed cases and continuing fatalities in the U.S. – a team of Canadian researchers is basing their hopes on quercetin, a flavonoid from plants.
At the center of this flurry of optimism is research helmed by Dr. Michael Chrétien, a renowned scientist at the Clinical Research Institute of Montreal. Along with his co-researcher, Congolese scientist Majambu Mbikay, Dr. Chrétien is currently awaiting approval to send the drug (derived from plants) to China for clinical trials that will test it against the novel coronavirus.
While this would be the first clinical study to test quercetin against COVID-19, natural health experts have long credited this natural plant pigment with the ability to deal with a variety of viruses. In fact, Dr. Chrétien describes quercetin as a “broad spectrum antiviral” that has been shown in studies to be effective against such formidable diseases as SARS, the Ebola virus, and the Zika virus.
Incoming data from quercetin trial will be monitored minute-by-minute from Montreal
In a series of interviews and articles, Dr. Chrétien has released details of the imminent study.  Once the team is granted approval to send the quercetin to China, samples will be delivered to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan.
Canadian and Chinese scientists will then collaborate on the trials, which will involve about 1,000 test patients.  Drs. Chretien and Mbikay will join colleagues from the non-profit International Consortium of Antivirals (which Chrétien helped to found in 2004 as a response to the SARS epidemic) in maintaining a round-the-clock communications center.
From there, they will be able monitor patients’ progress in Wuhan, including viewing patients’ charts and X-rays.  According to Dr. Chrétien, it may be possible to have results on quercetin’s ability to treat COVID within 60 days of the beginning of the trial.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

“Bingo! It works!” Groundbreaking researcher’s earlier studies on SARS and Ebola laid the groundwork for current COVID research
Since the 2003 SARS outbreak – which infected over 8,000 patients in 26 countries – Dr. Chrétien has been studying potential treatments (including quercetin) for the virus, in the event that it resurfaces.  And, while clinical trials haven’t yet been performed, quercetin has shown great promise in combating SARS (severe acute respiratory distress) in animal models.
This is very significant, because COVID-19 is structurally similar to SARS.  In fact, the new coronavirus is also known as SARS-CoV-2.  And, earlier research has given cause for hope.
In a 2014 study published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, Drs. Chrétien and Mbikay concluded that a glucosylated form of quercetin (Quercetin 3-B-O-D glucoside) targeted various steps of viral entry and protected mice against the Ebola virus.
The team also learned that pre-treatment with quercetin, rather than post-treatment, offered the best protection.  In a recent interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News Network, Dr. Chrétien offered a more informal reaction to the Ebola study’s encouraging results.
“Bingo! It worked!” he recalled.
Dr. Chrétien, who is generally recognized as one of the most renowned scientists and medical researchers in the world, has a strong emotional and professional connection with China.
He received training under noted Chinese researcher Dr. C.H. Li, and served as an honorary professor at both the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College.
This therapy is non-toxic, safe and pre-approved for use by humans
The good news: the FDA has already approved quercetin as safe for human consumption – meaning that no animal testing is necessary.  This also means that if the treatment works, it should be available quickly.
The quercetin will be in the form of easily-administered oral supplements.  And, Dr. Chrétien asserts that quercetin is so safe that even the high doses used in the study will not cause side effects.
Co-researcher Dr. Mbikay notes that quercetin would cost a mere $2 a day – a negligible amount that stands in stark contrast to the $1,000-per- injection cost of existing COVID-19 treatments.  “It (quercetin) doesn’t even compare in price,” Dr. Mbikay pointed out.
He added that he is particularly hopeful that quercetin could eventually be used to ease outbreaks in African countries – which he says lack the infrastructure for treating COVID-19.
A natural way to inhibit viral replication and defeat influenza
Quercetin, a plant pigment found in fruits and vegetables, is currently used to treat inflammatory diseases, reduce allergy symptoms and lower cholesterol.
But what is particularly relevant – especially now – is quercetin’s ability to boost the immune system and interfere with viral replication.  In a review published in Viruses, the authors concluded that quercetin inhibited viral infections in the early stages – particularly during viral attachment and viral-cell fusion.
Quercetin has already shown the ability to inhibit both the A and B types of influenza, along with the H1N1 and the H3N2 viruses. Some forward-thinking physicians in the US already credit quercetin with being both safer and more effective than Tamiflu, the “gold standard” of medical therapies for influenza.
And, researchers are reporting that viruses seem to be incapable of developing immunity to quercetin – another huge plus.
To boost your own intake of dietary quercetin, opt for healthy amounts of organic unpeeled apples, dark cherries, cocoa, dark leafy greens, green tea and onions.
Quercetin is also available as a supplement, with natural healers advising typical dosages of 500 mg twice a day. As always, consult your own integrative healthcare provider before adding quercetin to your immune-boosting routine.
Discover a safe way to improve quercetin bioavailability and “supercharge” its therapeutic potential
It’s simple: be sure to consume vitamin C!  Natural health experts already know that vitamin C has antioxidant, immune system-boosting and antiviral effects.
As reported previously in NaturalHealth365, high-dose IV vitamin C is already being used throughout China to help combat the COVID-19 outbreak – with three different new studies winning approval.  On March 3, the government of Shanghai, China, announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of IV vitamin C.
Chinese scientists and physicians are reporting that high-dose vitamin C is achieving “good results in clinical applications.” They credit the nutrient with improving endothelial function and treating acute lung injury and respiratory distress.
In addition, vitamin C helps to regenerate quercetin and maintain its antioxidant properties – leading researchers to believe that combining the two could pack a double virus-fighting punch.  And preliminary research seems to back this up!
In a study published in Journal of Research in Medical Sciences, researchers found that a combination of 500 mg of quercetin and 250 mg of vitamin C lessened cell damage and caused a marker of inflammation to decrease by 62 percent.
Natural health experts are currently recommending dosages of 3,000 to 6,000 mg of vitamin C a day to fight viral infection. However, consult your own integrative doctor before supplementing, because you may need much more – depending on the intensity of your infection.
Naturally, a strong immune system is of premier importance – especially in times such as these. Staying well hydrated, getting good quality sleep, keeping physically active, and eating organic fresh food can pay off in terms of maintaining a strong immune system.
No doubt, the question of whether quercetin is effective against COVID-19 remains to be seen in clinical studies. Dr. Chrétien, himself, is careful to warn against “false hope.”  But, given the encouraging results of earlier studies, the hopes for quercetin may, indeed, be based in reality.

"Alarming coronavirus UPDATE: Cremations soaring, 50,000 new infections estimated daily in Hubei province","(NaturalHealth365) The coronavirus epidemic nightmare that’s been taking the world by storm is leaving many people with more questions than answers. One thing we do know is that the World Health Organization (WHO) seems to be uncomfortably close to the Wuhan-based outbreak.
As we’ve previously reported on, the virus (named 2019-nCoV) seems likely to have originated out of a Biosafety Level 4 laboratory (BSL-4) in the central Chinese city.  This is one of the only labs in the world classified by the WHO as able to handle deadly pathogens.
Now it seems likely that the global organization was well aware of what was going on in this lab – and thanks to this bioweapons research, death rates and even cremation rates appear to be skyrocketing in China.
Coronavirus update: Millions at risk and THOUSANDS already dead, experts weigh in on the true extent of outbreak
According to the latest “official” numbers, the death toll from coronavirus has exceeded 1,300, with over 60,000 people infected.  But, even more alarming: Michael Ryan, head of the WHO’s health emergencies program has said, “I think it’s way too early to try to predict the beginning, the middle or the end of this epidemic right now.”
The virus has spread to at least 35 confirmed countries and there are millions still in lockdown in China.
But in even more frightening news, the true number of deaths and infection rates may be wildly misrepresented. Consider this:
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

Some reports from undercover journalists indicate that cremation rates in funeral homes surrounding Wuhan are skyrocketing, with as many as 300 bodies per day or more being sent through just ONE over-taxed crematorium
With harrowing news of bodies piling up faster than they can be disposed of, Chinese funeral home workers are being driven to pure exhaustion
Taiwan news outlets recently shared weather maps which show an insane rise in sulfur dioxide levels in the air surrounding Wuhan, up to a massive 1700ug/m^3, easily exceeding known danger levels of just 80ug/m^3. No other Chinese city nor Chinese power plant has sulfur dioxide levels this high. Sulfur dioxide emissions is associated with the burning of organic matter…leading many people to the disturbing conclusion that mass cremations are occurring.
All told, many experts and disease analysts estimate that the true rate of infection for 2019-nCoV is as high as 50,000 per day.
All this death, all this chaos – all for the sake of biological warfare research that’s likely been approved by the WHO?
Expert opinion: WHO getting it hands dirty with biological warfare
The idea that the WHO not only knows about but secretly endorses bioweapons research isn’t as ludicrous as it may sound. There’s plenty of evidence already, for instance, that the U.S. military has exposed unsuspecting Americans to hundreds of tests of biological warfare since at least the mid-1900s.
And as we’ve already mentioned, the laboratory in Wuhan is officially designated by the WHO as a lab cleared to handle and store the world’s deadliest pathogens. This lab and other ones like it – including at least 13 in the United States – are also known to engage in biological warfare research…and we’re supposed to believe that the WHO didn’t realize what was going on in their special labs?
It’s a link too close to ignore, and is exactly why bioweapons experts like Dr. Francis Boyle and other officials like Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas call foul on the WHO’s reluctance to admit their role in propagating this dangerous, human-engineered virus.
Of course, they have strong incentive to cover it up…just imagine the PR nightmare of an organization intended to protect global health being found out as one that participated in a direct threat against it.
As always, stay tuned to NaturalHealth365 for more live updates on this virus.  And, keep in mind, we have already published a “vitamin solution” – which you’ll never hear about from the mainstream media or government health agencies.

Protect your health: Discover the best antioxidant for the human body,"(NaturalHealth365) As the world reels from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic – and people engage in “social distancing” in an attempt to mitigate it – the importance of having a strong immune system has never been more important.  Unfortunately, the mainstream media refuses to talk about how a mighty antioxidant can help improve immune function!
For senior citizens – who experts say are at heightened risk from the novel coronavirus – the matter is particularly urgent.  Scientists have learned that a natural antioxidant produced in the body – glutathione – is strongly linked with disease prevention and longevity.
For example, the latest scientific research highlights the potential of using glutathione as an effective tool in the fight against viral conditions – leading some to hope that it could play a significant role in avoiding the threat of COVOD-19.
While glutathione is not a “magic bullet” against any single condition or disease – including COVID-19 – there’s no denying that optimal levels can help maintain health and protect against illnesses, while shortfalls can set you up for dangerous outcomes.  For a variety of natural strategies to help you ramp up your glutathione levels … keep reading!
Glutathione performs an array of life-sustaining functions
First off, let’s understand why glutathione is so indispensable.
First and foremost, glutathione’s free radical-scavenging powers are so potent that it has earned the nicknames “the mother of all antioxidants” and “the body’s master antioxidant.”  These antioxidant properties allow glutathione to protect cell mitochondria and body tissues from the damaging, inflammatory and disease-causing effects of oxidative stress.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

Glutathione also supports, promotes and recycles other important essential antioxidants, including vitamin C, vitamin E, alpha lipoic acid and CoQ10.
In addition, glutathione contains sulfur – which gives it a “sticky” quality. This adhesiveness allows glutathione to attract and bind to an array of toxins – including carcinogens, heavy metals, synthetic chemicals, pesticides, herbicides and even EMF radiation.
Once the toxins have attached, they are escorted harmlessly from the body in urine and bile – a process known as “Phase II detoxification.”
Glutathione is such a powerful detoxifier that the current gold standard of medical treatment for acetaminophen overdose – now the leading cause of liver failure in the United States – is to give megadoses of n-acetyl-cysteine, which triggers a protective, detoxifying burst of glutathione production.
Other glutathione tasks include helping to synthesize proteins, assisting in the transport of amino acids into and out of cells, acting as a co-factor in important enzymatic reactions and enhancing the function of disease-fighting cells such as leukotrienes, T-cells and macrophages.
Glutathione also appears to be anticancer – capable of causing apoptosis, or programmed cell suicide in cancer cells.
Finally, some research supports glutathione’s antiviral properties. In one especially relevant study, scientists found that raising glutathione levels through supplementation could cause a significant decrease in production of the dengue fever virus.
Antioxidant WARNING: If you want to avoid poor health conditions
Every time glutathione performs an essential function in the body, its levels “take a hit” – meaning that constant renewal and replenishment is required.
The consequences of low glutathione can be grave.
In a study published in the well-regarded medical journal Clinica Chimica Acta, the team found that glutathione is critical in protecting against toxicity and disease – and that depletion of the antioxidant is linked to heart disease, cancer and neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.
Additional research has pointed to the association between glutathione shortfalls and type 2 diabetes, cystic fibrosis, HIV infection and chronic fatigue syndrome.
Because glutathione regulates homocysteine – an amino acid which in high levels is linked with heart disease – it plays a vital role in cardiovascular health.
In fact, people with low glutathione are 30 percent more likely to have a heart attack than those with higher levels.  While low glutathione carries dangerous consequences, higher glutathione is linked with longevity!
In an important study published in Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine, researchers found that high glutathione levels accompanied “excellent physical and mental health in women aged 60 to 103.” The healthiest participants – those at the very top in measurements of physical and mental health – had correspondingly high blood levels of glutathione.
Factors that can cause glutathione deficiency include medication overuse, exposure to environmental toxins, poor diet (heavy on refined sugars, processed foods and GMOs), sedentary lifestyle and stress.
And, there is one glutathione depleting factor that none of us can prevent – normal aging.
While Mother Nature lavishes generous amounts of glutathione on the young, those of more mature years tend to experience steadily-decreasing levels – making deficiency common in older adults.
Fortunately, there are many things you can do to boost your levels.
Increase glutathione levels through diet and exercise
Experts report that you can spur your body’s glutathione production by eating foods that contain the glutathione “building blocks” cysteine, glutamate and glycine.  Of course, it never hurts to consume healthy amounts of foods that are naturally rich in glutathione – such as asparagus, avocado, cantaloupes, tomatoes and oranges.
But because glutathione breaks down in the digestive tract, it is actually more productive to eat foods that encourage its assembly such as, sulfur-rich broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, garlic and onions. (organic is best, of course!)
Cysteine-rich eggs are also a good bet, as is undenatured raw whey protein.  In addition, regular physical activity can increase glutathione levels.  Just keep in mind, don’t overdo it!
“Overtraining” or extremely rigorous exercise can actually drain your glutathione levels.
Can supplements and natural nutrients really help build glutathione?
The answer is a definitive “yes!”  Supplements and natural nutrients can be effective allies in your quest for higher glutathione levels.
For example, vitamin C assists in the production of glutathione – while glutathione returns the favor by recycling vitamin C.  In other words, each raises the level of the other.
Vitamin D3 and MSM (methylsulfonylmethane) promote the manufacture and function of glutathione, while B-complex vitamins such as vitamins B1,B2, B6 and B12 – are outright requirements for its production.
The minerals selenium and magnesium can also support better glutathione levels.  Plus, studies have shown that alpha lipoic acid, green tea, fish oil and resveratrol actually switch on the “genes” for glutathione production.
Finally, silymarin – the active constituent of milk thistle – preserves glutathione in the liver.
What is the best form of supplementation?
While some experts feel that glutathione is broken down in the digestive tract and is not effective when taken as a supplement, others recommend newer formulations that are believed to be more bioavailable.
If you would like to try glutathione supplementation, your best bets are probably glutathione intraoral sprays – which are absorbed through mucous membranes in the mouth – and liposomal glutathione, which protects against breakdown in the digestive tract.
Integrative healthcare providers typically recommend 250 mg to 500 mg once or twice a day between meals. Of course, check first with your own doctor before supplementing.
Glutathione is truly one of the body’s most effective weapons against disease. It’s well worth the effort to safeguard your levels of this hard-working antioxidant.

Coronavirus UPDATE: U.S. hospitals are preparing for 96 MILLION coronavirus infections,"(NaturalHealth365)  Here’s another coronavirus update that has many U.S. healthcare providers worried about the future.  In today’s article, we thought we’d share some of the latest projections on coronavirus infections, deaths, and its impact on U.S. hospitals.
With news about mask, gown, and glove shortages in healthcare institutions around the United States, the impact of coronavirus continues to be felt – and it will likely keep on growing, in the coming months.  According to leaked data from the American Hospital Association (AHA), the number of U.S. cases of coronavirus is projected to reach a titanic number over the next few months!
And, if projections hold up, this will be an unprecedented shock to the American healthcare system.
LEAKED information: Officials estimate coronavirus death toll could reach half a million people in U.S. – with 96 million total infections
In a February 2020 presentation from the AHA – part of which was leaked to Business Insider – officials shared their dire estimations about the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus responsible for the potentially fatal respiratory illness now known as COVID-19.
Among their warnings, AHA officials estimate as many as 96 million people will contract SARS-CoV-2, and as many as 480,000 people will die of complications from the disease and respiratory distress it causes. Based on these projections, the coronavirus will tax U.S. hospitals and healthcare institutions at a 10 times higher intensity than a severe flu season.
Other parts of the world, especially Northern Italy, continue to be hard-hit by this virus – now officially recognized by the World Health Organization as a pandemic.

Coronavirus update in New York: The National Guard has been deployed
In other breaking coronavirus news, the U.S. National Guard has now been deployed to New Rochelle, N.Y., just north of New York City.
The drastic move is in an attempt not just to contain the spread of the coronavirus – as unfortunately, there are already 108 confirmed cases in this small town – but “mitigation,” according to a March 10 article from U.S. News & World Report.
The National Guard and other public officials are reportedly tasked to close all schools, community centers, and places of worship within a 1 mile “containment radius” for at least two weeks. U.S. military forces will also be present to help ensure quarantine measures maintained, deliver food to quarantined individuals, and help clean schools.
The “official” word is still out on whether travel restrictions, including community-, state-, and nation-wide, will be imposed.  If this virus continues to spread (as predicted), you can be sure to see widespread travel restrictions take place.
Meanwhile, a new study was just published on March 3 in National Science Review. The paper, called “On the origin and continuing evolution of SARS-CoV-2,” details a research team’s findings about the genetic mutation of the coronavirus.
The researchers found just a 4 percent genetic variability between the SARS-CoV-2 and a related coronavirus strain, yet found other evidence which suggested “the divergence between the two viruses is much larger than previously estimated.”
The researchers also identified two major types of the SARS-CoV-2 genome – which they called L type and S type.  “Whereas the L type was more prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan,” the authors note, “the frequency of the L type decreased after early January 2020. Human intervention may have placed more selective pressure on the L type, which might be more aggressive and spread more quickly.”
“On the other hand,” they continue, “the S type, which is evolutionarily older and less aggressive, might have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure.”
While this paper has already met its fair share of criticism – including a call to retract the paper from a team of researchers from the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research – we at least know that we’ll probably have as many questions as answers right now about this ongoing and actively evolving news story.
But, between you and me, perhaps the administrators of U.S. hospitals need to read this – about a viable solution being deployed in China.
Stay tuned to NaturalHealth365 for more updates, as they become available and focus your attention on keeping your immune system strong!

VIDEO: Wuhan family reveals lifesaving coronavirus story,"(NaturalHealth365) Dr. Richard Cheng offers all of us an amazing story of recovery from the coronavirus.  If you’ve been following us – at NaturalHealth365 – the last few weeks … then, you know plenty about Dr. Cheng, who is doing some magnificent work inside Wuhan, China for many of the people infected with the coronavirus.
Today, Dr. Cheng shares a “daughter’s story” about a patient of his in Wuhan, China.  This woman has a 70 year old mother that got infected with the coronavirus.  Mind you, this older woman was already in very poor health – with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease plus many other health issues.
This coronavirus story will make you think differently about the power of nutrition
Toward the end of January, this poor lady started to feel “flu-like” symptoms but, what happened next will amaze you.  Listen now to Dr. Cheng, as he shares what happens next!
This story illustrates the importance of educating yourself before getting sick.  Not only that, but the importance of having supportive (well-informed) family members around you, in case you get sick.
In addition, heaven forbid you ever have to be admitted into a hospital – this is where you need to have strong (intelligent) family members close by to help you – when you need help the most!
The real problem with getting a cold or flu…
For the record, I do think that flu-like symptoms can be quite dangerous for “immunecompromised” individuals.  In other words, like the lady featured in today’s video, if you already are physically weak and have many (chronic) health issues … the flu can be life-threatening.

Keep in mind, there are times when a hospital visit or conventional medical interventions are needed and lifesaving.
But, having said that, all of us would be wise to take better care of ourselves by keeping the body, mind and spirit as strong as possible – to be prepared for the more challenging times in our life.  Stay physically active, eat well and be sure to maintain high antioxidant levels in your body.
This last tip … consuming lots of antioxidants (in food and supplement form) is crucial … because it’s so valuable in supporting immune function.  Let’s also remember the importance of staying well hydrated.
Please share this story far and wide – via email, because the typical social media outlets will not “support” this kind of information.  Stay tuned, as we continue to update you on the coronavirus. as more news is expected to emerge.

Breaking News: COVID-19 patients getting vitamin C therapy in N.Y. hospitals,"(NaturalHealth365) We are now rapidly approaching half a million confirmed cases of COVID-19, globally.  Doctors and health experts – around the world – are scrambling to find effective treatments that will help people suffering from the respiratory disease caused by the COVID-19 infection.  Diving headfirst into a flurry of clinical trials and experimental drugs are medical teams in New York, one of the hardest hit areas in the U.S.
One “therapy” out of New York City that doesn’t seem to be getting quite as much press coverage as it should – despite actually having years of research to back up its use – is higher than normal amounts of vitamin C.  Could something as simple as a nutrient be a potentially successful remedy in the fight against such an unknown (life-threatening) viral infection?
New York doctors express optimism over a vitamin therapy given to COVID-19 patients
Earlier reports out of China indicate that high amounts of vitamin C – delivered intravenously – have been effective in managing COVID-19 cases.  Critical care doctors from New York have taken note, and in some places are reportedly administering 1,500 milligrams of intravenous vitamin C – three to four times per day – to confirmed COVID-19 patients.
Healthcare providers reportedly have seen significant improvement in patients taking this vitamin C therapy compared to other patients who haven’t received high amounts of this potent antiviral and antioxidant nutrient.
How much vitamin C is enough?  Well, let’s say this: it’s way more than the “recommended dietary allowance” of 75 to 90 mg for adult women and men, respectively.  Basically, the report suggests that doctors are giving 1,500 mg of vitamin C – 4 times per day.
And, according to many vitamin C experts, the reason for any “vitamin C success” is due to its frequency of administration – throughout the day.  To overcome any intense bacterial or viral infection, it’s very important that critically ill patients receive consistent amounts of this lifesaving vitamin, on a regular basis until symptoms are gone.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

Doctors believe the “much higher-than-normal” amounts being administered are helping people who are requiring intensive care for coronavirus.  Keep in mind, levels of vitamin C tend to drop dramatically if and when a person gets sick.  Sepsis is a perfect example of the need for more vitamin C, when sick.
The reason is that sepsis launches a strong inflammatory response – which can affect nutrient levels, so aggressively replacing the levels may prove to be beneficial for helping the body fight off an infection.
Natural healthcare strategies to help you avoid the need for toxic “treatments”
For those curious about how to get vitamin C in your diet … you can aim to boost your own natural supplies by adding more vitamin-C rich food like, broccoli, cauliflower, red peppers, and citrus fruit.  If you want to boost your vitamin C levels via supplementation … we suggest you talk to your integrative healthcare provider about what’s best for you.
If you’d like to show your physician what another doctor thinks about vitamin C … check out this special report (with video) about Dr. Cheng and his amazing experience with treating COVID-19 patients in China.
Of course, when it comes to food … be sure to choose organic varieties to avoid unwanted chemicals in your diet that stress out your immune system.
Meanwhile, in a nearly unprecedented move, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already given the “green light” for New York doctors to begin clinical trials with various drugs for COVID-19 treatment.  As of the writing of this article, no drugs has been approved by the FDA for COVID-19.
But, medical providers are experimenting with the off-label use of drugs including hydroxycloroquine and azithromycin.  It’ll be interesting to see what kind of other treatments, natural or otherwise, come out of this pandemic response.
Stay tuned, as we at NaturalHealth365 continue to monitor coronavirus developments, as they unfold.

Coronavirus UPDATE: Massive coverup exposed by bioweapons expert,"(NaturalHealth365) As we continue to report on the latest news about the coronavirus epidemic, we’re beginning to realize there’s so much more to 2019-nCoV than mainstream media would have you believe. We only need to start with the virus’s origin story to start pulling back the layers of deception and misinformation.
As we’ve stated in an earlier article, the prevalent theory has been that the coronavirus began in a wet market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Now, blistering new revelations from an American bioweapons expert shatter this theory and point to a much more sinister beginning for the virus, which has amassed a current death toll of over 800 people.
Deadly virus created in a Wuhan laboratory, says U.S. international law professor – a laboratory specially designated by the World Health Organization
Dr. Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He holds multiple prestigious degrees, including a doctor of law degree from Harvard Law School and a PhD in Political Science from Harvard University. He’s best known for drafting The Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989.
In a recent interview published on January 30 to YouTube, Dr. Boyle gave a detailed account of how 2019-nCoV didn’t originate in the wet market of the Hubei province. Was the virus ever actually present in the market, and could its presence have accelerated the rapid viral outbreak? Absolutely, Dr. Boyle and others argue.
But that doesn’t mean the virus actually began there.
So, where did this dangerous strain of coronavirus begin?  Dr Boyle contends that the virus was manufactured and bio-engineered in a Biosafety Level 4 laboratory – a laboratory that just so happens to be located directly in Wuhan.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

This laboratory is specially designated by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the only lab in China that can contain and work with the world’s deadliest viruses.  Dr. Boyle asserts this is proof that the WHO knows far more about the outbreak than they are letting on.
The allegation is consistent with a January 2020 paper published by The Lancet, which found that more than a third of the patients tested in their sample had NO contact with the Wuhan wet market, including “Patient Zero.”
In other words, growing evidence suggests that 2019-nCoV leaked out of the Wuhan laboratory and into the surrounding community, where it would go on to infect thousands of unsuspecting people – a number that’s steadily rising.
Now scrambling to contain the epidemic, the Chinese government initially tried to cover it up. They even threatened and attempted to silence a Chinese doctor named Li Wenliang who first warned of the coming outbreak.
Sadly, breaking reports tell us that Wenliang succumbed to the virus on February 7.
New coronavirus has links to manufactured SARS virus, HIV virus
Why manufacture and design a lethal and unprecedented virus? Simple, Dr. Boyle asserts: to create biological weapons for warfare.
In the interview (which hopefully won’t be removed from YouTube), he hypothesizes that WHO-affiliated Wuhan scientists genetically tinkered with the coronavirus responsible for SARS (SARS-CoV) until it became the monstrosity it is now (2019-nCoV).  The current coronavirus reportedly has a 15 percent greater fatality rate and 83 percent greater infection rate than SARS did, which ransacked the world in 2002 to 2004.
Dr. Boyle also cites evidence indicating that Chinese officials smuggled coronavirus materials out of a Canadian lab that’s known for leading research, development, and testing of biological warfare weapons.
Additionally, a team of Indian virologists just revealed in a January 2020 paper that the 2019-nCoV shares an “uncanny similarity” of genetic inserts with the virus that causes AIDS. (Their paper has been withdrawn…another thinly-veiled cover up attempt?)
Tellingly, Chinese doctors have reportedly been using the HIV drug lopinavir/ritonavir as an off-label treatment for people with 2019-nCoV…so clearly there’s no denying at least some link between these two viruses.
Meanwhile, other scientists seem to be wasting no time to continue tinkering with viruses and trying to capitalize on the outbreak.
In an article published by CNN on February 7, Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, states rather bluntly: “What’s important is that as a global community we maximize our effort to get a vaccine available in the shortest possible time.”  Big Pharma experts are hopeful that a vaccine will be available as soon as 2021 – “faster than it’s been done before,” brags Shattock.
Stay tuned for regular updates about the coronavirus and more tips on keeping your family healthy.

Coronavirus vitamin solution NOT revealed by the mainstream media or government health agencies,"(NaturalHealth365) As you may know, NaturalHealth365 has been a proponent of vitamin C for a wide variety of infectious diseases.  Naturally, many of our readers have been quite concerned about the most recent news about the coronavirus outbreak in China.
Well, today, I have some very good news – about a way to protect yourself naturally – coming from our friends over at the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service (OMNS).  The editor, Andrew W. Saul, PhD has outlined a scientifically valid way to keep your immune system strong.  Enjoy the read!!
Press Release: OMNS January 26, 2020
The coronavirus pandemic can be dramatically slowed, or stopped, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C.
Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.
It is very important to maximize the body’s anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.
“I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.” (Robert F. Cathcart, MD)
The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:
Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams (or more) daily, in divided doses.
Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. (Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000)
Magnesium: 400 mg daily (in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form)
Zinc: 20 mg daily
Selenium: 100 mcg (micrograms) daily
Vitamin C [1], Vitamin D [2], magnesium [3], zinc [4], and selenium [5] have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.
The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C’s early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s.[6] Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980.[7]
It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?

"Breaking NEWS: IV vitamin C research approved for COVID-19, multiple studies","(NaturalHealth365) As the coronavirus continues to spread, so does the misinformation surrounding this health crisis.  No doubt, if you’ve been watching the mainstream news, it’s difficult to differentiate between what’s real and what’s “fake news.”  But, the saddest part of all this is: while people are panicking about the spread of COVID-19, there’s been little coverage of what scientists are studying for the treatment of this virus – especially as it relates to IV vitamin C.
Many people will be surprised to discover that it’s been reported that intravenous (IV) vitamin C is being used throughout China to help combat the COVID-19 coronavirus. Not only is it being used for treatment, but it’s being used for prevention, too!
In fact, three new IV vitamin C research studies have been approved to allow medical professionals and scientists to take a better look at how vitamin C is working in patients affected by the virus.
IV vitamin C studies look promising, but Big Pharma-controlled media outlets BLOCK the news
Currently, three different studies have been approved in China on the use of IV vitamin C to help fight the coronavirus. The first approved study included giving between 12,000 and 24,000 milligrams a day of IV vitamin C, with the doctor involved urging the use of vitamin C to help prevent COVID-19 as well.
On February 13, another clinical trial involving IV vitamin C was announced within China. In this study, the plan is to give 6,000 mg per day for moderate cases and 12,000 mg per day for more severe cases. The heads of this study also noted that they’d like to see studies done on oral vitamin C as well since it can be applied to even more patients and those who are still at home.
Yet another research trial on intravenous vitamin C for the treatment or coronavirus was announced on February 21. Reporting on these new studies, Dr. Richard Cheng noted that vitamin C is also promising for the prevention of COVID-19.

While people have died from the outbreak, there’s been little reporting on the use of large doses of IV vitamin C. Vitamin C is involved in not only killing viruses but the prevention of virus replication, which can reduce the severity of the virus on patients.
Of course, it’s not surprising that the media has labeled vitamin therapy as “false” information.  In fact, hospital-based, physician-directed use of IV vitamin C has been discredited, marginalized, or completely suppressed.
Protecting yourself with higher levels of vitamin C
While medical science continues to obsessively search for a drug or vaccine “solution,” vitamin C already exists as a clinically-demonstrated, plausible method for preventing and treating COVID-19.  And, although it may be difficult to have access to IV vitamin C, you can protect yourself against the virus by increasing your oral intake of vitamin C – in both powder and liposomal forms.
In addition, go ahead and increase your intake of foods that contain vitamin C, such as organic papayas, asparagus, broccoli, and red peppers.  However, keep in mind, you will likely need much higher amounts of vitamin C to reap those antiviral benefits.
And if you think you’re already getting sick, vitamin C gets depleted when the body begins its inflammatory response. A supplement is likely the best option to get the amount of vitamin C you need.  So, when feeling sick, aim for an “initial” amount of 3,000 – 6,000 mg to give your body the boost it needs.
And, remember, the sicker you are, the more vitamin C you’ll need – throughout the day – to counter the negative effects of oxidative stress caused by free radicals.

Shocking admission: How the coronavirus is affecting our children,"(NaturalHealth365) People continue to worry about the effect the coronavirus will have on more vulnerable populations as it continues to spread in countries across the world. First detected in China, scientists continue to learn about this new strain of coronavirus.
When viruses hit, it’s often the youngest among us and the elderly who suffer the most. But recent news reports have noted that kids who are infected with the coronavirus seem to have very mild symptoms or even no symptoms at all. Recently, MSN reported a case of a newborn baby who was infected with the coronavirus and then recovered on her own without the need for medication – a promising insight into the virus that’s worried so many parents around the world.
What happened to a baby infected with the coronavirus?
Xiao Xiao, a baby girl in Wuhan, China is reportedly the youngest child to have contracted the disease at this point.  Her mother had coronavirus while pregnant, although it’s unclear whether the baby contracted this virus due to close proximity to the mother or by blood.
The baby was diagnosed with mild heart disease, and while they found that she was infected with the coronavirus, doctors decided not to treat the virus because she didn’t exhibit symptoms. She had no cough, no fever, and no obvious problems breathing.  Within two weeks, tests showed that the baby girl had recovered fully from the coronavirus and she was discharged from the hospital.
Earlier news reports have noted that babies and children who are infected with coronavirus seem to display milder symptoms than adults do, likely because the immune system begins to deteriorate with age. And it’s been aging adults who have been hit the hardest by the coronavirus. However, while children may get a milder form of the virus, it’s still essential to take preventive measures and take steps to boost your child’s immune system to avoid the coronavirus.
Reduce the risk: Strategies to support a healthy immune system
When it comes to reducing the threat of bacterial or viral infections, you can take some simple steps to give your child’s immune system the support it deserves.  Check out these 5 simple tips:
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

“Power up” by eating more fruits and vegetables: Adding more servings of fruits and veggies to your child’s diet will help to ensure they get all the vitamins and minerals they need.
Breastfeeding: If possible, breastfeed your baby.  Breast milk is packed with immunity-enhancing white blood cells and antibodies.
Add Probiotics: Make sure your kids are getting enough probiotics from fermented foods like sauerkraut, miso soup or a good quality supplement.  Remember, the strength of the immune system depends (largely) on a strong digestive system.
Vitamin C supplementation:  Vitamin C, particularly in higher amounts when feeling bad, has already proven to be useful in dealing with the coronavirus.
Zinc Supplementation: Zinc helps boost the production of white blood cells to kill viruses.  In some cases, it may be necessary to supplement your child’s diet with zinc – to help boost immunity.
Of course, we always suggest you consult with an integrative physician before making any changes to lifestyle habits.  But, let’s not forget – when it comes to reducing the risk of bacterial and viral infections – use common sense.
In addition, it’s always a good idea to be more aware of our surroundings and be vigilant about maintaining healthy personal hygiene habits.  Stay well hydrated, get an adequate amount of sleep and stay physically active.  All of these tips will prove to be invaluable in maintaining great health.

Chinese authorities heavily spray disinfectant on people and cities to halt spread of coronavirus,"(NaturalHealth365) As promised, we’re back with the latest coronavirus update based on the current  news about what the Chinese government has decided to do to “control” the spread of this deadly virus.  No doubt, when you watch the videos (below) – you will be shocked!
Officially named COVID-19, the coronavirus has currently infected over 77,000 people, and over 2,300 people have lost their lives as a result of grave complications caused by the virus – including pneumonia, kidney problems, and severe acute respiratory infection, or SARI.
Among the dead are two former passengers of the infamous cruise liner Diamond Princess, which made waves in last week’s headlines (no pun intended).
Officials all over the world are ramping up their frantic attempts to control the spread of the virus – for instance, by barring travel and putting entire cities in China on lockdown. And we’re sure many of you have been as astounded as we’ve been by the chilling, dystopian-like videos and photos coming out of China, which show trucks and men in hazmat suits spraying disinfectant everywhere.
What are these chemicals – and will they even stop the virus?
What is the Chinese government spraying over its population?
Video footage all over YouTube is truly shocking!  What began as massive chemical sprays over Chinese towns and cities on lockdown has devolved into men dressed in full hazmat gear walking into buildings and spraying disinfectant inside – with people mere feet away.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

Reportedly, these solutions contain a mix of bleach and water. But it’s impossible to know exactly what’s in these chemicals or what the environmental and health impacts will be.
Of course, we can’t exactly say we’re surprised to see such extreme measures. COVID-19 is so incredibly contagious that we are now seeing infected people become “superspreaders” of the disease. For example, a single 61-year-old woman from South Korea has infected least 37 others from her church.
Prior to making others sick, the woman had allegedly refused to be tested for COVID-19 – even though she was exhibiting signs and symptoms including a fever.
Her reason? She hadn’t recently traveled abroad.
Severe travel restrictions initiated to and from China
According to the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs, there is a Level 4 travel advisory in China right now – the highest advisory possible, rated as “Do Not Travel.”  “We strongly urge U.S. citizens remaining in China to stay home as much as possible and limit contact with others, including large gatherings,” the Bureau of Consular Affairs writes on their website.
They have even more sobering advice: “Consider stocking up on food and other supplies to limit movement outside the home.  In the event that the situation deteriorates further, the ability of the U.S. Embassy and Consulates to provide assistance to U.S. nationals within China may be limited.”
Meanwhile, the United States is temporarily closing its borders to anyone who’s been to mainland China within the past two weeks.
If there’s one thing to takeaway from today’s coronavirus update, it’s this: even if you aren’t planning on traveling any time soon, you still need to be cautious.  We know that thousands of people all over the world have fallen ill from this disease even though they haven’t done any traveling themselves.
And if you are going to travel – especially by air – keep these tips in mind:
Stay away from people who are showing signs of an illness, including coughing and sneezing
Wash your hands regularly
If you’re using hand sanitizer avoid handling receipts, as these products appear to increase the amount of BPA chemicals absorbed through your skin
And, above all, avoid processed sugars and maintain the healthiest (organic) diet possible – to keep your immune system strong!
One final note: should you bother with a face mask?  Be warned: there’s no evidence that regular masks actually stop the spread of coronavirus.
This is because surgical masks aren’t made with material that’s rated to keep out viral particles and, unlike thicker N95 respirators, they don’t tightly fit against the face.  A N95 respirators can protect against COVID-19 – but if people start buying these masks en masse … there may be a shortage.

Breaking NEWS: Coronavirus doctor from China speaks out,"(NaturalHealth365) We, at NaturalHealth365, have been reporting news about the coronavirus since its discovery in Wuhan, China.  Naturally, there are many theories circulating about the origin of this virus from “just another flu strain” to speculation that this is a bioweapon designed in the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory (Level 4) or part of the “depopulation agenda” of some very disturbed individuals.
Wherever you stand on this topic, today’s news will prove to be invaluable because the mainstream media refuses to report on the single most important aspect of this virus.  The solution!
Chinese medical doctor is helping coronavirus patients with a powerful vitamin protocol
Conventionally speaking, our modern healthcare system is merely focusing their attention on travel bans, testing and isolation of infected people.  And, while that all may seem to be a “reasonable” response to a potential pandemic outbreak of the 2019-nCoV (novel coronavirus).  Obviously, much more needs to be done to protect all of us.
In fact, the one thing that’s not talked about – nearly enough – is how to improve (and maintain) the health of the immune system.  Can vitamin C – known to be an excellent vitamin for protecting immunity – actually help people infected with the coronavirus?
Editor’s Update (2/29/20): Unfortunately, the video we posted – originally with this article – by Andrew Saul, PhD talking about some very important health information associated with vitamin C and the coronavirus has been removed by YouTube.
After a nationwide mention in the NY Post, MSN, and Business Insider, the 10-minute video reporting on the successful use of vitamin C for the coronavirus by doctors in Wuhan has been censored on the internet.  No doubt, media manipulation that suppresses lifesaving information is alive and well in the “free” world.

But, as I was updating this article, I found another place that stored the video … hopefully this version will remain available to the public.

Discover what is really killing coronavirus patients
Dr. Richard Cheng is doing some magnificent work inside Wuhan, China for many of the people infected with the coronavirus.   And, while government health agencies seem laser focused on just toxic medications and the hope of a vaccine, Dr. Cheng is doing much more than that.
The results are quite impressive.  Listen now – in this video below – directly from Dr. Cheng.
Ask yourself this: why is this information being suppressed by the mainstream media and conventional medical “authorities.” Do they really believe that this vitamin therapy is useless? Or, could this just be an example of profits over public safety.
I’ll let you decide. But, ultimately, it’s up to each and every one of us to do everything we can to keep our immune system strong. After all, it is our best defense against disease.
Stay tuned to NaturalHealth365 as we continue to report on this evolving story.

Canadian physician and medical journalist exposes media’s “fake news” disinformation campaign about vitamin C,"(NaturalHealth365) Schools have closed, toilet paper is in short supply, and every state in the United States has now been affected by COVID-19.  Many people are working at home, some are in quarantine, and others in isolation as the government tells us it could be months, if not more than a year, until a vaccine is developed to stop this pandemic.
Meanwhile, Canadian physician and medical journalist – W. Gifford-Jones, M.D. – is exposing the media’s “fake news” disinformation campaign about vitamin C. Not only does he make the case through history for the use of vitamin C, but he talks about the lives lost due to the constant cover-up campaign against using high amounts of this powerful vitamin.
History backs up the use of vitamin C, why is the media silent?
In a recent YouTube video (watch below), W. Gifford-Jones, MD, who happens to be a Harvard trained surgeon and 96-year-old medical journalist, discusses vitamin C as a “miracle cure.”
A simple look back through history backs up the use of vitamin C to combat disease. Citrus has been used since the 1600s as a way to prevent and treat scurvy. James Lind, a Surgeon in the British Royal Navy, would go on to prove the benefits of citrus and vitamin C for scurvy prevention and treatment in the 1700s. Later, in 1948, polio was treated effectively with the help of vitamin C.
More recent research also backs up vitamin C as a powerful preventive measure and treatment for multiple diseases. Along with the well accepted role of preventing scurvy, significant research backs up the ability of high dose vitamin C to prevent the common cold.
Multiple publications exist on the role of vitamin C in atherogeneis and lipid metabolism, and some evidence shows that this vitamin in high amounts is highly effective at reducing the threat of atherosclerosis.  Gifford-Jones, MD even gives an account of his personal experience with high amounts of vitamin C as a way to treat atherosclerosis after he had a heart attack and a triple bypass.

Vitamin C has also been studied for its ability to prevent and treat cancer, diabetes, heavy metal toxicity, and its role in improved immunity.
Reducing the threat of COVID-19 with vitamin C
With people dying across the world of COVID-19, in a recent article, W. Gifford-Jones, M.D. urges the use of vitamin C as a “cure.”  He calls these deaths needless as health authorities and doctors continue to ignore the role high amounts of vitamin C can play in the treatment of this virus.
High amounts of intravenous vitamin C have already been used in China to combat COVID-19. We recently reported that three vitamin C studies were approved in China, although there’s been little reporting on the success physicians have had with this method of treatment.
According to Gifford-Jones, high amounts of vitamin C offer a great way to avoid the threat of this virus.  He recommends taking 2,000 mg doses twice a day to improve immunity.
If you begin to develop flu-like symptoms, his recommendation is to take 2,000 mg every hour as your bowels tolerate it.  Keep in mind, when taking vitamin C powder or capsules orally, you can experience loose stool or diarrhea, at your upper limits.
Another thing that’s important to remember: the sicker you are, the more you need.  Talk to your integrative doctor about what’s best for you … and, if they don’t know enough about vitamin C – find another doctor that can help you.

CDC warns U.S. hospitals to prepare for “surge” of coronavirus patients,"(NaturalHealth365) The coronavirus continues to be at the top of the news cycle lately, dominating the headlines as it becomes obvious that it’s not if, but when, it will affect the United States population.  And, with the flu season already at its peak in the U.S., many hospitals are already quite busy caring for the sick affected by the seasonal flu.
Now, we have the threat of a rapidly spreading coronavirus – which government health officials seem unable to “control.”  As we’ve said many times before, it’s up to each and everyone of us to keep our immune system strong, because relying on the government to “protect us” is not always the best idea.
According to a recent report by CNBC, the CDC is warning U.S. hospitals to begin preparing for a “surge” of patients affected by the 2019 novel coronavirus.  In addition, Federal health officials are urging Americans to start preparing for the possibility that “disruptive, aggressive measures” could be needed to stop the spread of this virus within the United States.
Hospitals on HIGH alert: Health official warn of a potential pandemic outbreak of coronavirus
Dr. Anne Schuchat, one of the top officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has been urging hospitals to begin looking at their pandemic plans to ensure they’re prepared. She noted that healthcare providers need to be ready for a “surge” of patients in hospitals and the ability to ensure that the hospital workforce is provided with adequate personal protective equipment.
Although the coronavirus epidemic has “officially” killed over 2,700 people, it still hasn’t met world health officials’ definition of a global pandemic.  However, it has spread to well over 24 countries across the world.  And, there’s a potential for this to change quickly, especially as this virus appears to be more contagious than the strains of the flu we see during flu season.
Keeping your immune system strong with powerful nutrients
The CDC now notes that it’s only a question of when the coronavirus hits the U.S. and how many people will be affected by the illness. Although aggressive travel restrictions and other measures are in place, the CDC said that more intrusive steps could be needed to control the virus.
Do NOT ignore the health dangers linked to toxic indoor air.  These chemicals - the 'off-gassing' of paints, mattresses, carpets and other home/office building materials - increase your risk of headaches, dementia, heart disease and cancer.

In the future, it could include workplace shutdowns, school closings, and postponing large public events or gatherings.
Although – at times – this situation may seem overwhelming, there are things you can do to keep your immune system healthy and strong.  And, you guessed it, you should always start with your diet.
Be sure to add more organic foods such as, citrus fruits, garlic, broccoli, spinach, red bell peppers, ginger, turmeric, miso, herbal tea, almonds, sauerkraut, kiwi, and pumpkin seeds.  Remember, eating locally-sourced, chemical free food (even if it’s not technically “certified organic”) can be one of the best things you can do for your health.
So, as soon as you can, start your search for local farmers markets and get to know your local farmer.  Even if it takes a little time to get there … it’s such a good investment in you.
Beyond making improvements to your diet, supplements are also a great way to help boost your immune system.  For example, certain vitamins and minerals have been proven to boost your immune system including:
Vitamin C – at least 1,000 mg / day
Vitamin D – at least 1,000 IU / day
Selenium – at least 300 mcg  / day
Zinc – at least 15 mg / day
Vitamin E – at least 15 mg / day
Keep in mind, many people may need substantially more supplementation, depending on one’s  own nutritional status and needs.  For optimal health, it’s not really a good idea to simply follow the “recommended daily allowance (RDA)” for any vitamin or mineral.
RDA levels are simply not enough – especially living in this modern world filled with environmental toxins and stress.
Fortunately, with a little effort (and a focus on good nutrition), we can correct many imbalances.  Never forget: you’re worth it!
