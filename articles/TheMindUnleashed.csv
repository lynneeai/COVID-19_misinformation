ISIS Orders Its Members to Avoid Europe and Wash Hands Frequently,"

(TMU) — Even ISIS is scared of CoViD-19. The international terrorist organization is warning its followers to avoid Europe.
Bizarrely, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has warned its followers to stay home and avoid Jihad in Europe.
For years ISIS has urged its followers to attack the West but now the group is telling them to steer clear due to the coronavirus, showing fear of the growing pandemic that has thus far infected 169,387 people, according to the Johns Hopkins coronavirus map.
The “healthy should not enter the land of the epidemic and the afflicted should not exit from it,” the statement said. It was translated by blogger Aymenn Jawad Al-Tamimi.

However, the group urges those sick jihadists already in Europe, to stay there as they are likely to sicken infidels, according to a directive printed in the group’s al-Naba newsletter, the Sunday Times of London reported.
The group also encouraged its followers to “cover the mouth when yawning and sneezing” and take the extra step to “wash the hands before dipping them in the vessels.”
“When one of you wakes from his sleep, let him not dip his hand into the vessels until he washes it three times, for he does not know where his hand spent the night,” the translation read.
According to ISIS, the coronavirus is a “plague” or “torment sent by God on whomsoever He wills.”
ISIS also advises jihadists to flee from a person infected with the coronavirus “as you flee from the lion,” and to wash their hands with soap to avoid infection, Military Times reported.
Finally, ISIS urges its followers to “put trust in God and seek refuge in Him from illnesses.”
While Syria has not reported any confirmed cases so far, Iraq, where most of the surviving remnants of the group remain, reported 124 coronavirus cases on Monday morning, with ten of them fatal, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Outbreaks of coronavirus have also been reported in other countries where ISIS is active, including Afghanistan and Indonesia.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has called Europe an epicenter of the new COVID-19 virus, with Italy, France, and Spain all banning public gatherings and the UK set to follow suit as the virus has claimed over 6,000 lives. The number of confirmed cases in Europe has passed 50,000, with more than 24,000 in Italy alone.
The al-Naba newsletter has covered the coronavirus outbreak since the beginning, previously calling it divine punishment for China’s treatment of Uyghur muslims.

New Xbox and Playstation 5 Consoles Could Get Delayed by Coronavirus Shutdown,"

(TMU) — The 2019-nCoV coronavirus has put life on hold for hundreds of millions of people in China over the past month, and regardless of how much the actual virus spreads outside of the mainland the economic impact will be felt across the world in the coming months.
China happens to be the manufacturing center of the world, and workers across the country are being told to stay home. Foxconn, the chipmaker that plays a key role in the production of Apple’s iPhone, has been temporarily shut down so the facility can instead be used to make surgical masks.
The change is necessary to help meet the demand for masks, but it is also causing obvious supply chain problems for Apple.
One executive with the company told Nikkei Asian Review under the condition of anonymity that “The [coronavirus] situation in China could affect the planned production schedule” of the next iPhone.
The vast majority of U.S. manufacturers have factories based in China, and many of them are facing similar supply chain problems.
Nintendo has recently announced that shipments of its Switch console to Japan are being delayed due to the coronavirus quarantine. There is even a possibility that the newest PlayStation and Xbox consoles won’t make their scheduled holiday release this year because of the nationwide shutdown caused by the coronavirus.
According to Business Insider, PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X could be delayed or perhaps have fewer systems available at launch as a result of the quarantine in China.
A recent post from the Jefferies Group explained:
“The video game sector is currently manufacturing, or beginning to, a once-in-several-years’ product generation change for the 2020 holiday season. If [company] shutdowns exceed a month or so, game schedules will be delayed. New consoles may likewise suffer supply issues from a prolonged disruption, ahead of their Fall 2020 planned launches.”
The post noted that “30-50% of art creation in western games is done in China,” and that nearly 100% of the hardware manufacturing also takes place in China.
Another Jefferies analysts wrote:
“If key supply chain participants in the PS5 or Xbox Series X were significantly disrupted, limited inventory for the launch window would be a bigger problem if it led to some games being delayed by a quarter. Given marketing, competition, and synchronized game release all scheduled for the next console generations, this bears watching.”
To prevent an economic downturn, the Chinese government delayed trading for a few days and then injected $22 billion into the stock market when it reopened.
Michael Kelly, head of the global multiasset firm PineBridge Investments, said that the world’s economy will likely see a downturn in the coming months as a result of the manufacturing shutdown alone.
“Damage will likely mount over the next several months, particularly in travel, oil, and the Chinese economy. And given China’s size and significance, weakness will spread elsewhere. Yet keep in mind that much stimulus had already been put in place to reverse 2019’s global slowdown,” Kelly said, according to Barrons.

(ZH) — The virus shock that has struck the global economy has been far faster and more severe than the 2008 financial crisis, Dot Com bust, and even the Great Depression.
In one fell swoop (several months), the global economy has ground to a halt; stock markets have crashed 30-50%, credit markets have frozen, commodities tanked, bankruptcies and bailouts seen, massive unemployment and worldwide GDP cratered.
Strict social distancing measures, mass quarantines, and travel bans across the world to combat the fast-spreading COVID-19 outbreak has been the reason why the global economy has crashed. At this very moment, more than a billion people are confined to their homes, some of the largest factory hubs are shuttered, and education systems are closed indefinitely.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. describes this moment as “the day the earth stood still.” Wall Street anxieties are growing by the day as a protracted shutdown of the global economy could trigger a depression.
To give you a worldly view, one from outer space, Bloomberg shares images from satellite company Planet Labs Inc.’s SkySat imaging orbiters that shows certain regions across the world that have ground to a halt:
Wuhan’s Yingwuzhou Yangtze River Bridge (before and after shutdown):
“The first image of Wuhan’s Yingwuzhou Yangtze River Bridge was taken Jan. 12, one day after Covid-19 took its first known life in China. By the time the second photo was taken, Wuhan was quarantined.” – Bloomberg
Great Mosque of Mecca, Islam’s holiest site (before and after shutdown): 
“At the heart of the Great Mosque of Mecca, Islam’s holiest site, sits the Kaaba, the cubic structure that orients Muslims’ daily prayers around the world. At the peak of the pilgrimage called the Hajj in late-July and early August, some 2 million people from around the world make their way to the site at once.” – Bloomberg 
Grand Canal channel in Venice, Italy (before and after shutdown): 
“Italy’s Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte snapped Europe to attention on March 8 when he ordered a lockdown of the country’s northern region, which includes Venice. A day later, he extended the lockdown nationwide.” – Bloomberg 
Epcot Center in Bay Lake, Florida (before and after shutdown): 
“Epcot Center in Bay Lake, Florida was meant to be the realization of Walt Disney’s fundamentally optimistic vision of a technology-driven global future. On March 18, two days after The Walt Disney Co. temporarily suspended theme-park operations.” –Bloomberg 
Volkswagen’s Tianjin, China factory (before and after shutdown): 
“After Germany asked its largest carmakers to help make masks and ventilators to treat Covid-19 victims, Volkswagen began building up production capacity in China. The company’s Tianjin, China, plant is pictured here.” –Bloomberg 
Miami Beach (before and after shutdown):
“Few places have struggled as vividly with coronavirus-related precautions as Miami Beach, where the disease arrived just as college students descended for spring break.” – Bloomberg 
Even if the pandemic and economic fallout were brought under control in the months ahead, there are still tail risk events that could trigger financial Armageddon.
Afterall, Guggenheim’s Scott Minerd declared on Bloomberg TV:
“…this is possibly the worst thing I have seen in my career… it’s hard to imagine a scenario in which you can contain the virus threat,” adding that “Europe and China are probably already in recession and US GDP will take a 1.5-2.0% hit.”

SXSW 2020 Has Been Canceled Due to Coronavirus Outbreak,"

(TT) — Austin Mayor Steve Adler declared a local disaster on Friday that effectively cancels this year’s South by Southwest festival. The 10-day event was scheduled to begin next Friday and expects hundreds of thousands of attendees to fly in from around the globe.
Major sponsors and companies have already pulled out of the event, including Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and Apple, and a petition to cancel the event has garnered over 50,000 signatures.
.@MayorAdler + Travis Co. have declared a “local state of disaster” following recommendations from Dr. Escott + the Expert Advisory Panel. This decision effectively cancels SXSW + proactively increases preventative measures for #ATX events.

— City of Austin (@austintexasgov) March 6, 2020

Spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that originated in China, has resulted in the cancellation of many other events across the country: the Houston-based oil and gas industry conference CERAWeek; Google’s I/O developer event, the tech company’s biggest event of the year; and Miami’s Ultra Music Festival, among others. Internationally, the Geneva Motor Show was shut down after the Swiss government banned gatherings of over 1,000 people, and the European Parliament has canceled over 100 events.
SXSW told The Texas Tribune on Monday that the festival would go on as planned and that organizers were taking precautions to reduce health risks for attendees. On Thursday, Austin Public Health maintained that no good would come from closing the festival.
“Right now there is no evidence that closing South by Southwest or other activities is going to make this community safer,” Dr. Mark Escott, Austin’s interim medical director and health authority, said in a statement. “We are constantly monitoring that situation. We’ve asked [an expert advisory panel] to evaluate that. And if there’s any evidence that our community will be safer by closing down mass gathering events, we will do that.”
But in recent days, several more scheduled guests have dropped out of the lineup, and public pressure to cancel the event has continued to grow. And since Wednesday, six people have tested positive for the virus in the Houston area after returning from a group trip to Egypt.
Festival passes can cost up to $1,725, but “SXSW does not issue refunds under any circumstances,” according to its website, nor does it offer credit for future festivals.
With programming spanning music, film, gaming, tech and education, SXSW brought in attendees from 106 countries last year, and a quarter of all attendees were international. In 2019, the festival raked in a record $356 million.
The virus — which causes seasonal flu-like symptoms — has a fatality rate of 3.4%, according to the World Health Organization. There are 17 cases of the virus in Texas; in 11 of those cases, people infected abroad were repatriated and held at a San Antonio military base. There is still no evidence of community spread in Texas, and there have been no fatalities in the state.
“Any large gathering holds potential for viral spread of disease,” Dr. Rama Thyagarajan, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School and a member of Austin Public Health’s expert advisory panel, said earlier this week.
“My message is for anyone attending any large public gathering to be informed about the risks of this virus spreading, and to take measures to protect yourself appropriately.”

"Stuck Indoors? Enjoy These Museums, Aquariums, National Parks, Zoos and Symphonies From Home","

(TMU) — Let’s face it: things are looking bad in the world, and if we haven’t already felt the heavy impact of the coronavirus outbreak, we soon will.
Across the English-speaking world, public events are being canceled, schools are being closed or placed on extended vacation, and cultural and art institutions are being shuttered en masse. Professional athletic organizations like the NCAA and MLB are canceling or delaying the start of their seasons, leaving sports fans in the lurch.
Meanwhile, whole municipal zones are instructing to shelter in place, self-quarantine, and otherwise lie low as authorities grasp at ways to keep the novel virus under control.
However, while we may be stuck at home, cultural institutions, national park services, symphonies, and zoos are now offering stunning virtual tours online, allowing us to enjoy some of humankind’s most amazing artistic and musical achievements from our homes.
Here are a few cultural “outings” you can enjoy from your computer, tablet, or phone!
Google’s Arts and Culture pages offer no less than 2,500 world-class museums and galleries, where you can peruse the collections of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the Whitney Museum in New York City, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, and the Tate Modern in London. You can also take a virtual tour of such locales as the Uffizi Galleries. And one cool “feature” of these Google tours is that you can zoom in on the priceless art far closer than you would ever be able to lean into it.
Various museums are also offering virtual tours through their websites. This includes the Louvre, which has a breathtaking exhibit in its Egyptian antiquities department; Madrid’s Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza, which offers a virtual tour of its Rembrandt and Portraiture in Amsterdam, 1590-1670 exhibit on virtual view; the Vatican Museums, which offer state-of-the-art 360-degree tours of Raphael’s Rooms, the Sistine Chapel, and other attractions; as well as a self-guided tour of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC.
In partnership with the U.S. National Parks Services, Google’s Arts & Culture pages are also offering a program called “The Hidden Worlds of the National Parks” that will bring the great outdoors to your living room or bedroom. The digital tour includes five national parks, including Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah, Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico, Dry Tortugas National Park in Florida, Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, and Kenai Fjords National Park in Alaska.
The Monterey Bay Aquarium in California may have been closed since March 12, but that’s not stopping it from allowing online visitors from enjoying the everyday life of its aquatic critters. Visitors can see a range of free live camera streams, ranging from their world-famous kelp forest to the jellyfish exhibit, or you can just watch penguins waddle about adorably. Scheduled feeding times will also be shown.
Meanwhile, at Boston’s New England Aquarium you can also watch feedings, tours, and a behind-the-scenes glimpse of operations through scheduled Facebook Live streams.
The California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco is also featuring views of penguins as well as their Philippine Coral Reef exhibit, while the Oakland Zoo is offering live views of their elephants, sun bears and black bears.
While nothing can substitute a live performance from a symphony orchestra, many are offering live streams of their performances rather than cancel them entirely. Old shows are also being offered for free online.
The Philharmonie Berlin, which will remain closed until at least April 19, has opened its digital library of performances to the public, allowing unfettered access to over 600 shows. Just use the code BERLINPHIL by March 31 to get a 30-day all-access pass to the orchestra’s amazing work. The Melbourne Symphony Orchestra is also live-streaming its performances through YouTube, and while those of us in the Western Hemisphere may not prefer to wake up at 7 p.m. AEDT (or 4 a.m. EDT) to catch a symphony performance, we can still watch replays on the orchestra’s YouTube channel. Make sure to check out their outstanding performance of Rimsky-Korsakov’s immortal classic, Scheherazade.

Betty White “Is Fine” Amid Outbreak as Netizens Express Worry for Senior Celebs,"

(TMU) — In news that should relieve many, actress Betty White has confirmed that she is doing just fine.
As the coronavirus outbreak continues to expand across the world, people have expressed concern about a number of prominent celebrities and figures who are in their advanced years—including the spry 98-year old White, who is best known for her role as Rose in the classic sitcom The Golden Girls (1985-92).
A representative of White confirmed Thursday to TODAY that the lifelong actress “is fine.”
Concern has spiked about White and others after news spread that another universally admired celebrity, Tom Hanks, had been diagnosed with CoViD-19 and placed into quarantine along with his wife, Rita Wilson.
On Wednesday, Hanks announced on Instagram that he and his wife, both 63, had tested positive for the novel virus while in Australia.
The news also comes as various sports leagues, including the NBA, MLB, and NCAA, had suspended their seasons while President Donald Trump halted all travel from Europe to the U.S. due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has warned that those in the over-60 demographic are among the most vulnerable to coronavirus. On Monday, a top official at the CDC urged people over 60 and those with chronic medical conditions to prepare for a potentially lengthy stay at home.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters:
“This seems to be a disease that affects adults and most seriously older adults.
Starting at age 60, there is an increasing risk of disease and the risk increases with age.”
On Twitter, users have expressed concern about White and other prominent elders.
In a widely-shared tweet, one person wrote:
“Someone get Betty White into her own quarantine… we can’t lose her #CoronaOutbreak“
While another warned:
“Coronavirus so help me god if you do anything to Betty White we’re gonna have some problems.”
As new cases of the novel virus continue to emerge in various parts of the world and many governments appear unprepared to deal with the crisis, we can simply hope that Betty—along with the elders in our own families and communities—are spared the worst of the outbreak.

Can’t Sleep and Feeling Anxious About Coronavirus? You’re Not Alone,"

(CONVERSATION) — This is a confusing and, frankly, scary time for a lot of us. There’s so much contradictory information, and the “right” thing to do yesterday is now the “wrong” thing to do today.
If you’re feeling edgy, having trouble sitting still or concentrating, finding yourself constantly or obsessively checking for updates, losing sleep, or waking in the early hours of the morning feeling anxious – you’re not alone.
These are completely normal, human reactions to a completely abnormal situation. Worrying about whether you’re doing enough to protect yourself and others, whether you’re going to lose income, and what this will all mean long-term is to be expected.
You might be wondering whether this worry and other feelings of anxiety might indicate a developing mental health problem.
Feeling this way for a few days, or even weeks, in the context of a major national emergency, does not indicate that you have a mental disorder.
But some people will need to access support or talk to their GP about ongoing concerns.
Normal fear responses are part of a healthy, adaptive process that allows us to get away from or deal with something we perceive as dangerous.
Normal anxiety:
is situation specific – related to a particular event of circumstance
is limited in time
does not have a long-term impact on your ability to go about your day-to-day life (although there may be short periods where it can feel overwhelming).
However, sometimes our fear can become overwhelming and start to impact on our ability to function in our daily lives.
Some anxiety symptoms to be aware of are excessive worry which is difficult to control, restlessness, feeling easily fatigued, having difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension or sleep disturbance.
In times of trouble, Australians usually band together to support each other with hugs, a helping hand and a nice hot cuppa. We raise money, have benefit concerts, and get to work so we can feel we’re doing something. We build belonging in our community, and feel a sense of accomplishment when we pull through together.
This time it’s different, and our normal ways of coping with disasters are not going to work. For many of us, social distancing means we are not able to use most of our day to day coping strategies either, such as going to the gym or hanging out with friends.
But there are things we can do to buffer against the impact of uncertain and traumatic times.
Having a strong sense of belonging, along with a regular sense of accomplishment, are key to our mental well-being. They’re linked with lower levels of depression and anxiety symptoms, and higher levels of mental well-being.
Belonging
Social distancing does not require social isolation. There are safe ways to connect with people that don’t involve putting yourself at risk of COVID-19 exposure.
Staying connected is not just a nice thing to do – it’s actually important for our health. Some theorists have suggested that belonging is a fundamental human motivation, just as compelling as the need for food.
Don’t wait for people to connect with you – reach out to them. There’s a good chance that they’re feeling isolated and afraid as well.
Accomplishment
It’s important to find ways in your day to day life to feel a regular sense of accomplishment, and it might be a matter of re-framing what you consider to be an accomplishment.
If you have kids in the background, dogs barking to be taken for a walk, and all the other wonderful interruptions that may come with working from home, it’s likely that just reading and responding to emails is an accomplishment in itself.
If you’re not working at the moment and funds are tight think about what else you can accomplish. Spring clean. Plant capsicum, strawberry or tomato seeds saved from your lunch and see if they will grow. Or learn something new, like robotics, knitting or crochet.
Sometimes what you’re experiencing will signal a more serious problem that needs some external support.
It’s time to seek help if:
symptoms of anxiety are starting to affect your ability to function in your daily life
the symptoms are getting worse
the symptoms feel overwhelming, or
the symptoms persist over time – more days than not.
Supports are available where and when you need them. The Lifeline phone line is open 24 hours on 13 11 14.
Beyondblue has online information and resources such as the beyondblue web chat.
For children, teens and young adults, KidsHelpline has supports available by phone at 1800 55 1800, web chat or email.
Your GP can help you to identify whether your symptoms meet the criteria for an anxiety disorder. They can also write a mental health care plan, if appropriate, and refer you to professional services in your local community.

US Bans Filming or Recording of White House Press Briefing on COVID-19 Outbreak,"

UPDATE: The White House allowed TV cameras to broadcast Wednesday’s press briefing following push back from Tuesday’s filming blackout.
(CD) — The Trump administration on Tuesday barred the media from filming or recording audio of a daily coronavirus briefing at the White House, sparking outrage from members of the press.
Journalists were only permitted to take still photos of the briefing, HuffPost reported Tuesday, leading some to characterize the press conference as a mere photo-op rather than an effort to convey critical information about the disease as it spreads across the United States.
The briefing was led by Vice President Mike Pence, who was appointed by President Donald Trump to head the White House’s coronavirus response.
Al-Monitor reporter Laura Rozen called the decision to ban video and audio “absolutely outrageous” and said the move “will further signal [to] the public that the Trump administration doesn’t have a handle on this.”
Jim Acosta, CNN‘s chief White House correspondent, tweeted that “the closest thing to an explanation we got as to why the coronavirus briefing was off-camera with no audio was when Pence said Trump was on camera a bunch today.”
WH is allowing only still photos of this Coronavirus briefing. No audio or video permitted. Here is a photo of the VP as the briefing began. pic.twitter.com/kB05s6IRvO
— Jim Acosta (@Acosta) March 3, 2020

“We need transparency. Instead we are getting this,” Judd Legum, author of the Popular Information newsletter, tweeted late Tuesday.
The photo-only press briefing came as the Trump administration is reportedly working to clamp down on White House coronavirus messaging. Federal scientists and health officials, according to the New York Times, are now required to coordinate with Pence on all public appearances and statements related to the outbreak.
Michael Halpern, deputy director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, wrote in a blog post last week that Trump’s effort to “muzzle” federal scientists “is a highly dangerous power grab that undermines both emergency response and public faith in the reliability of information coming out of the government.”
“If this censorship and retaliation trend continues, we can expect more gross incompetence in handling the virus’ spread,” Halpern warned. “More people will get needlessly sick and more people will needlessly die.”

Mass Graves for Coronavirus Victims in Iran Can Be Seen From Space,"

(TMU) — Since the first cases of CoViD-19 were confirmed in Iran, there has been a great deal of confusion about how many deaths the illness has caused and how many cases there are throughout the country. The official tally in Iran is 430 deaths with just over 10,000 confirmed cases. However, posts made on social media and reports from citizens in Iran tell a different story.
A disturbing report published in the Washington Post this week has revealed that mass graves have recently been dug in Iran. The mass graves are so large that they can be seen from space and are clearly much larger than would be needed for a few hundred people.
Satellite imagery that was provided to the New York Times by Maxar Technologies, a Colorado-based space technology company, showed that a large unused section of a cemetery in the Behesht-e Masoumeh complex was being excavated around February 21, when the virus was beginning to grow out of control in the region.

The cemetery is located in Qom, which is about 80 miles south of Tehran, and the major epicenter for the virus in the country. Satellite images dating back to October showed no activity at the site until mid-February when the large excavation project began.
Later images showed two large trenches which were each at least 100 yards long. There were also indications that large piles of lime were next to the trenches, which is usually used to neutralize odors that come along with mass graves. The use of lime in the graves was also confirmed by Iranian health officials, according to the Post.
The content of the satellite photos was verified by expert analysis, video testimony, and official statements from eye-witnesses and people familiar with the project. It is also disturbing that these trenches were clearly dug in a hurry, showing a departure from traditional burial practices, leading many experts to believe that these are desperate times for Iran.
The findings confirm previous allegations from Iranian citizens that the death toll was far higher than the government was willing to admit. At the beginning of the outbreak in the country, a man was arrested for filming dozens of bodies inside of a morgue, likely on their way to the mass graves seen in the satellite photos.

‘Bat Soup Girl’ From China Apologizes After Viral Video Leads to Hate Mail and Death Threats,"

(TMU) — A social media influencer from China has issued a public apology after video of her eating bat soup in 2016 re-emerged following the coronavirus outbreak.
Wang Mengyun is a Chinese YouTube celebrity who has gained a massive following with her online travel show, where she can be seen devouring exotic foods including animals that are considered disgusting to the western palate.
In her 2016 video, the young Chinese woman can be seen picking a bat from a bowl of broth before tearing it apart with her hands and picking off pieces to eat.
The clip has been shared widely, especially after some scientists revealed that the coronavirus may have spread from the Wuhan Seafood Market that authorities dubbed “ground zero” for the virus.
In the video, she can be seen holding the soup and stating:
“The soup we just had was very delicious and had a fruity flavor.”
She then holds the bat close to the camera and asks:
“Doesn’t it look like a mini wolf-dog? … There are so many nutrients in it.”
However, the video’s recent spread appears to have been a classic case of fake news being shared thanks to social media hysteria.
While many claimed that the video was filmed in Wuhan—and went so far as to point to the video as proof of the “dirty” eating habits of the Chinese people—the video was actually filmed in the Pacific island nation of Palau where the bat dish is eaten locally.

And while regional scientists had suggested that the latest novel coronavirus outbreak began at the Wuhan Seafood Market—where various exotic creatures including snakes, rats, bats, koala meat, and wolf pups were sold—a new study has shown that while the virus seems to have originated with bats, the earliest reported victims didn’t have any contact with the market.
LADBible reports that in a post to Chinese social media platform Weibo that has since been deleted, the vlogger asked for forgiveness for the spread of the video. She also revealed that she had been receiving a flood of hate mail.
“Sorry everyone, I shouldn’t eat bats,” she wrote, before proceeding to detail the negative comments she has received.
Wang said the comments included:
“You should go to hell. You should be killed in the evening. You’re abnormal. You’re disgusting. Why haven’t you died.”
She continued:
“It’s all because in 2016, when I was screening a tour program in Palau, a south Pacific island, I ate a soup of local people’s daily food.
Back in May 2016, I didn’t know what the virus was at that time. When the video was released, I only want to introduce the lifestyle of the local people.”
Continuing, Wang explained:
“Here are some special points I want to make:
1. The video was shot in 2016 and released during 2016-2017. Recently it was turned over by some accounts sponging off the heat and fanning out malicious panic.
2. When shooting the video, I really didn’t know there was a virus. I didn’t know until recently.
3. In the video, fruit bats are raised by local people, not wild ones. Many countries around the world eat this. It’s a daily dish in many countries, but it’s also a bat, can’t argue with that.”
As James Palmer argued in Foreign Policy magazine, the viral spread of the video in large measure reflects the often racist prejudices that have long been applied to Asians in general and Chinese people specifically. Palmer wrote:
“At a time of heightened fear over a viral pandemic, the Palau video has been deployed in the United States and Europe to renew an old narrative about the supposedly disgusting eating habits of foreigners, especially Asians. Images of Chinese people or other Asians eating insects, snakes, or mice frequently circulate on social media or in clickbait news stories. This time, that was mixed with another old racist idea: that the ‘dirty’ Chinese are carriers of disease. 
Many Americans long believed that, as the New York Daily Tribune wrote in 1854, Chinese people were ‘uncivilized, unclean, filthy beyond all conception.’ Today, those same ideas have often been transferred to other groups such as South American refugees, yet they still persist in the way some Westerners think about China.
These prejudices can fuel fear and racism. As the Wuhan virus spreads, the Chinese as a group are more and more likely to be blamed for its incubation and spread. In countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, where there are already clashes around ethnic Chinese, those sentiments could turn nasty. In the West … it could fuel both government and public prejudices.”

(ZH) — The Wall Street Journal has provided an update on the emergency charter flight to evacuate Americans from the epidemic-stricken Chinese city of Wuhan.
The Boeing 767, with about 230 seats, is preparing to depart from Wuhan Tianhe International Airport on Tuesday for California, amid new fears that coronavirus has uncontrollably spread across the country.
The U.S. State Department’s rapid response operation to evacuate Americans from the region is due to the expected increase in the number of cases in the days ahead.
There are roughly 1,000 Americans trapped in Wuhan, and only 230 will get seats on the chartered flight. 
I will be surprised if the 300 who are supposed to be on the flight are there. Without transport, how are they realistically supposed to get there? Walk… possibly bike?
— 𝒫𝓇𝒶𝓎 𝒻𝑜𝓇 𝒲𝓊𝒽𝒶𝓃 (@plantsNbabes) January 27, 2020

We noted on Sunday that U.S. diplomats and their families were likely first on the list to receive seats.
People with tickets told the Journal that the chartered flight is expected to land in Ontario, California.
Vermont native Priscilla Dickie, 35, told the Journal that she and her daughter, 8, have seats on the plane but might not be able to get to the airport since transportation has come to a standstill. She said she’s 20 miles from the airport without a means of transportation.
Benjamin Wilson told the Journal he’s preparing for the worse and hunkering down with his Wuhan native wife and 7-year-old daughter.

“I would consider sending my daughter, if that were an option,” Wilson said.
“But I wouldn’t leave my wife. But if my wife and daughter could travel together, then absolutely yes.”
A U.S. official told the Journal over the weekend that additional emergency evacuation operations would be conducted this week, which would include the busing of Americans from the outbreak zone to other cities for outbound flights to the U.S.
Besides the U.S., Reuters reports the following countries have already announced evacuation plans for their citizens trapped in Wuhan:
France expects to repatriate up to a few hundred of its 800 citizens living in the Wuhan area. Evacuees will have to spend 14 days in quarantine to avoid spreading the virus in France.
The German air force repatriating 90 Germans living in the area, Der Spiegel magazine reported on Monday.
Japan is expected to arrange charter flights as early as Tuesday for any of its citizens who wish to return from Wuhan, two sources familiar with the matter said. Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said about 430 Japanese nationals have been confirmed to be in Hubei province.
Spain’s government is working with China and the European Union to repatriate Spanish nationals from the Wuhan area, Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said.
Britain is talking to international partners to find solutions to help British and other foreign nationals leave Wuhan, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.
Canada has about 167 nationals in the Wuhan area, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said on Monday, and eight people have sought consular assistance, which is being provided. While the minister did not rule out possible evacuations, he did not indicate there were any planned at the moment, adding that each consular request would be evaluated on a “case by case basis”.
Russia has been in talks with China about evacuating its nationals from Wuhan and Hubei province, Russia’s embassy in China said.
The Dutch government is assessing ways to evacuate 20 Dutch citizens from Wuhan, press agency ANP reported.
Authorities in Myanmar said they had canceled a planned evacuation of 60 students from Mandalay who were studying in Wuhan. Kyaw Yin Myint, a spokesman for the Mandalay municipal government, told Reuters that a “final decision” had been made to send them back after 14 days, once the virus’ incubation period had passed.
As the number of confirmed cases passes 4,500 with at least 106 deaths, many say the actual numbers are likely much higher.

‘Terrifying’ New Study Warns 2.2 Million People Could Die in US Without Drastic Action,"

(CD) — An alarming scientific report compiled by British researchers and shared with the Trump White House warns that, in the absence of drastic and coordinated government action, the novel coronavirus could kill as many as 2.2 million people in the United States alone.
The new research (pdf), led by epidemiologist Dr. Neil Ferguson and published Monday by the Imperial College of London, shows that merely acting to slow rather than completely stop the spread of COVID-19 would “still likely result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems (most notably intensive care units) being overwhelmed many times over.”
“For countries able to achieve it, this leaves suppression as the preferred policy option,” the researchers wrote. “In the U.K. and U.S. context, suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases, and household quarantine of their family members. This may need to be supplemented by school and university closures.”
Successful suppression of the virus could take a significant amount of time, the researchers noted—”potentially 18 months or more.”
The New York Times reported late Monday that the researchers’ “terrifying” projection of as many as 2.2 million possible deaths in the U.S. was shared with the White House’s coronavirus task force last week, when President Donald Trump was still downplaying the threat posed by the COVID-19 outbreak.
“We don’t have a clear exit strategy,” Ferguson told the Times. “We’re going to have to suppress this virus—frankly, indefinitely—until we have a vaccine. It’s a difficult position for the world to be in.”
Ferguson likened the possible health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to those caused by the 1918 influenza outbreak, which killed an estimated 675,000 people in the United States and tens of millions more worldwide.
Here's the @nytimes article about the new coronavirus model, noting it suggests that 2.2 million Americans could die if there is no action: https://t.co/Oj9BLN1q1I The study apparently shook the White House partly out of its passivity.
— Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) March 17, 2020

The team of researchers “also shared its fatality estimates with the CDC,” according to the Times, “including that eight to nine percent of people in the most vulnerable age group, 80 and older, could die if infected.”
During a press conference on Monday, Trump falsely claimed that “nobody ever thought about” the coronavirus threat a month ago.
“This is a bad one,” said Trump, who on Sunday recommended that people in the U.S. avoid gathering with more than 10 people. “This is a very bad one. This is bad in the sense that it’s so contagious. It’s just so contagious.  Sort of, record-setting-type contagion.”
Trump: ""We have a problem that a month ago nobody ever thought about.""
False. Both with regard to pandemics generally, coronavirus pandemics in particular, and this specific coronavirus. 
And the US had its first confirmed case in January. https://t.co/GipI01oUBg

In an interview with CNN Sunday, Harvard University epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch said the coronavirus crisis “was foreseeable, and foreseen, weeks and months ago.”
“Only now is the White House coming out of denial,” said Lipsitch, “and heading straight into saying it could not have been foreseen.”

Pope Francis is Too Sick to Conduct Church Service as Coronavirus Sweeps Across Italy,"

(TMU) — Pope Francis has announced that he is too ill to attend his church service today. As a result the mass was cancelled.
His announcement comes as officials in Italy are scrambling to control the quickly growing COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak which has now killed 14 people and infected over 500 in the country.
Rome specifically, where Pope Francis calls home, has had three known patients, but all of them have since recovered.
There is no clear indication that Francis has caught the coronavirus, he could just be experiencing the common cold or flu. But considering the extent of the outbreak in Italy, there is a possibility that the 83-year-old is suffering from COVID-19, especially considering how many people he interacts with on a regular basis.
Francis appeared sick during a service on Ash Wednesday where he was seen sneezing, coughing, and blowing his nose.
During the Ash Wednesday services the pope expressed his support for coronavirus sufferers.
“I wish, again, to express my closeness to those who are ill with coronavirus and to health care workers who are caring for them,” he said, according to Vatican News.

Vatican Spokesman Matteo Bruni assured reporters that the pope’s illness was “slight.”
“Because of a slight indisposition, he preferred to stay inside Santa Marta. All other commitments will go ahead,” Bruni said.
According to the Sun, Francis had interacted with many worshippers in the days before his illness.
Meanwhile, Lombardy governor Attilio Fontana, the region at the epicenter of Italy’s coronavirus outbreak, has placed himself in quarantine after one of his staff members became infected.
Fontana addressed the public in a Facebook video on Wednesday where he appeared wearing a mask over his face.
“For now I don’t have any type of infection so I can continue to work … but for two weeks I will try to live in a sort of self-isolation,” he said.
""I am ready to protect everyone from Lombardy and anyone who comes into contact with me.”

(ZH) — Global equity markets are taking a beating on Thursday as the death toll climbed to 171, with now 8,123 cases of coronavirus confirmed in China and 8,241 worldwide.
Recent developments could force the World Health Organization (WHO) to issue a global alert over the alarming infection rate of the deadly virus, as a growing number of international health experts recommend.
Evidence shows the virus can be transmitted from person to person before any signs or symptoms, which is one of the reasons why the WHO could soon declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as the virus spreads across the world.
Dozens of cities are shut down across China, more than 50 million folks are quarantined to their homes, and doctors have warned that there will likely be no vaccine for at least one year, which suggests the virus will continue to spread across China and the world.
Airline carriers started to cut flights to and from China on Wednesday. Western companies have announced factory and retail store closings across the country, and this will likely result in a massive loss of business that could produce an economic shock felt around the world.
On Wednesday, the Epoch Times tweeted an interview with a Wuhan citizen, who claims people in the outbreak areas “can’t get any medical treatments” nor “a diagnosis” because hospitals are overloaded with patients. He said people “sit and wait to die.”
“Imagine being a Wuhan citizen…they can’t get any medical treatments, they can’t even get a diagnosis. They can only sit and wait to die.”
“Imagine being a Wuhan citizen…they can't get any medical treatments, they can't even get a diagnosis. They can only sit and wait to die.”

He warned that transmission of the deadly virus isn’t just “oral” but also “through the eyes.”
He claimed the government isn’t telling the truth about symptoms, because in many cases there are no symptoms as people spread the disease during the incubation period, which could be 7 to 10 days before signs are seen.
Another perspective of life in Wuhan is nothing short of an “apocalypse,” said 21-year-old US-born college student Nicholas Schneider, who was interviewed by Reuters on Wednesday.
“It’s like a ghost town, barely any people and cars. It’s a weird feeling. I feel like I’m in an apocalypse somehow,” Schneider said via a phone interview.
Late last week, a Chinese woman claiming to be a nurse made an emotional video on social media, warning that more than 90,000 people have already been infected.

"Cannabis Lobby Warns Against Smoking Due to Pandemic, Suggests Edibles as Alternative","



Facebook

Reddit

(TMU) — The spread of the coronavirus has disrupted or destroyed many things: the airline industry, the economy, and any sense of normalcy that we may have enjoyed until quite recently.
And now, it appears that CoViD-19 will also change the way marijuana smokers enjoy their beloved herb, figures in the U.S. cannabis industry warned on Wednesday.
The furious spread of the novel virus means that smokers should no longer share their joints and in general should lean more toward enjoying edible products, advocates warned.
In a statement, pro-cannabis lobbying group the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) warned that “while we are living through the current pandemic we should all be more mindful of our day-to-day consumption practices, and how the choices we make impact not only ourselves, but also those we care about.”
Continuing, NORML Executive Director Erik Altieri said:
“As long as cultures have consumed cannabis, the practice of sharing a joint among friends has been a common social practice. 
But given what we know about COVID-19 and its transmission, it would be mindful during this time to halt this behavior.”
Altieri also warned users that it is dangerous to continue sharing the implements used to smoke cannabis—such as bong, vaping pens, water pipes, and other devices—and these should be cleaned with disinfectant gel.
So far, the coronavirus has killed at least 154 people across the United States—a toll experts believe will sharply rise in the coming days. The overwhelming majority of reported fatalities involved people with underlying health conditions ranging from heart ailments to diabetes, kidney failure, and hypertension.
Some experts also believe that smoking or vaping can make people more vulnerable to a severe infection including pneumonia due to the coronavirus, Scientific American reports. This is primarily due to the wealth of evidence showing that smoking can suppress immune functions of the lungs, triggering inflammation. Preliminary research shows that the same can be true of e-cigarette smokers.
Melodi Pirzada, the chief of pediatric pulmonology at NYU Winthrop Hospital on Long Island, said:
“All these things make me believe that we are going to have more severe cases—especially [in] people who are [long-term] smokers or vapers … it is definitely common sense to think that once you have a history of smoking or vaping, the whole airways, the defense mechanism of your lungs—everything changes.”
Additionally, the NORML statement noted:
“Further, because COVID-19 is a respiratory illness, some of you may wish to limit or avoid their exposure to combustive smoke — as this can put undue stress and strain on the lungs.”
Altieri added that “the use of edibles or tinctures can eliminate smoke exposure entirely.”
The statement added that it remains important to obtain regulated, lab-tested products—although it still remains difficult to purchase regulated cannabis products in states that still enforce prohibition. The statement continued:
“This advice is especially pertinent for portable vaping devices, as unregulated products have been known to contain vitamin E and other dangerous additives that can harm the lungs.
Concluding, Altieri said:
“We also encourage everyone to remain vigilant of online misinformation (like any claims cannabis or CBD can help cure or protect against this virus) and to beware of potential scammers promoting similar claims.”
NORML claims that roughly 25 million Americans have smoked cannabis in the last year.

(TMU) — In a stunning example of how wherever there’s life, there’s hope, a 95-year-old Italian grandmother has become the oldest known woman in the country to recover from coronavirus.
Alma Clara Corsini arrived at the Pavulo Hospital in the northern province of Modena on March 5 after suffering from symptoms of the deadly disease.
She was among Italy’s nearly 60,000 people confirmed to have the virus as of Sunday. The country’s north has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic.
However, doctors and specialists have been working hard across the country and tended to Corsini throughout her ordeal, making her the first person in Modena to recover from the novel virus.
Earlier in the week, she confirmed:
“Yes, yes, I’m fine … They were good people who looked after me well.”

Gazzetta Di Modena reports that she was able to make a healthy recovery without any need for “antiviral therapy,” while her body showed a “great reaction” despite the infection.
Corsini’s good fortune was even shared by Pope Francis, who took to Facebook to post an image of her with members of the medical team that saved her. In the post, the high pontiff wrote:
“In Italy, a 95-year-old granny is the first patient to be cured of coronavirus. Alma Clara Corsini has won this battle for her life to give us hope.”

Corsini has since been discharged from the hospital and is back at her home in Fanano.
Over the weekend, no less than 1,400 people died in Italy as the country races to control the horrific spread of the novel virus.
All movement has now been banned inside the country and non-essential businesses shuttered as the country continues to stand firmly as the epicenter of the global crisis, exceeding China’s death toll last week despite its smaller population.
Over 6,500 Italians test positive for Covid-19 every day, with the average age of those dying standing at 78.5 years.
On Sunday, an additional 651 Italians died, bringing the death toll to at least 5,400.

Scientists Infect Monkeys With Coronavirus in Search of a Cure for COVID-19,"

(TMU) — While many people around the world have just recently become familiar with the term “coronavirus,” it is a classification that describes a number of different illnesses which range in severity from the common cold, to the newly discovered COVID-19 novel coronavirus that has dominated international headlines over the past month.
Researchers around the world are taking different approaches to develop a possible cure or vaccine for the illness as it continues to quickly spread across the planet.
A controversial approach taken by scientists at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) was detailed in a study published earlier this month in the journal PNAS.
In the study, 18 rhesus macaque monkeys were intentionally infected with the MERS-CoV coronavirus, also known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome. MERS is one of the most deadly strains of coronavirus, and has been known to pneumonia, fever and even organ failure. However, human to human transmission is far less common with the MERS strain than we have seen with the new COVID-19 strain, so it is far less contagious.
Researchers treated the infected monkeys with an experimental vaccine called remdesivir, which has been shown to be effective for multiple different coronavirus strains.
The researchers found that the experimental drug was also effective at treating the monkeys in their study that were infected with MERS. This has led the team to conclude that this drug could be effective at treating the new COVID-19 coronavirus strain.
The conclusion of the study stated that “Taken together, the data presented here on the efficacy of remdesivir in prophylactic and therapeutic treatment regimens, the difficulty of coronaviruses to acquire resistance to remdesivir , and the availability of human safety data warrant testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial. Our results, together with replication inhibition by remdesivir of a wide range of coronaviruses in vitro and in vivo, may further indicate utility of remdesivir against the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV emerging from Wuhan, China.”
The monkeys who took part in the experiment were euthanized shortly after the study was completed.

As millions prepared to travel, George Gao Fu, head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, warned the Chinese public to stay home during the holiday season, warning that this was a “crucial time” to stop the virus.
With 444 confirmed cases, Wuhan remains the epicenter of the epidemic. Reports about another virus-related death are circulating on social media, along with a terrifying video of first-responders in full-body gear treating an individual who had seemingly collapsed in the middle of the road.

If confirmed, this would be the first case of the virus in the UK, and would indicate another intrusion into the developed world, this time in Europe.
The UK Health Secretary said Friday morning that the coronavirus is “increasingly likely” to hit Britain, the Times of London reports.
According to CNN, the number of coronavirus cases confirmed around the world has climbed to 622 (once again, the graphic below is ever-so-slightly out of date):

And the scramble for face masks continues, with Hong Kong stores swiftly running out of stock, and black-market sellers engaging in widespread gouging of terrified customers.
There’s a real scramble for face masks in Hong Kong. The only ones I could find were these: HK$850 for a box of 20 (about US$100) ones, and some small ones for kids. People are still lining up to buy what’s left. https://t.co/JqYOE1MW5O pic.twitter.com/AnY7ABPHSN

Update (0841ET): Beijing says the number of confirmed Wuhan cases in China has climbed to 634, bringing the global total to 641.

Here’s a breakdown of cases by region (though it might be slightly out of date, it gets the point across):

In keeping with China’s insistence that the Wuhan virus is far less deadly than the 2003 SARS outbreak, the SCMP reports that almost half of the 17 people who have succumbed to the virus so far were aged 80 or older, and most of them had pre-existing health conditions. All of those who died, 13 men and four women so far, were from the central province of Hubei, and were treated in hospitals in its capital, Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak. Chinese authorities have quarantined most of the biggest sources in the province.
Here’s some more information on the victims, including the types of illnesses they faced:
At least nine of those who died had pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, coronary artery disease and Parkinson’s disease. Eight were in their eighties, two in their seventies, five in their sixties and one man was in his fifties. The youngest woman was 48 and had a pre-existing condition.
One 89-year-old man, surnamed Chen, had a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, coronary heart disease and other conditions. He began experiencing symptoms on January 13, including difficulty breathing but not fever. Five days later, he was admitted to the Wuhan Union Hospital with severe breathing difficulties, and tested positive for pneumonia. He died the following evening.
The 48-year-old woman, surnamed Yin, had suffered from diabetes and had also had a stroke. She first had a fever, aches and pains on December 10 and her condition slowly deteriorated. She was treated at two hospitals in Wuhan before she died on Monday.
Officials in Beijing have been cautious about making definitive statements about the origins and characteristics of the disease, including its incubation period, saying more investigation was needed.
“There’s still a need for further study of the virus over time,” said Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, at a press briefing on Wednesday.
“As for the impact on younger people, according to current epidemiology and what we know right now, they really aren’t susceptible,” he said.
Patients as young as 15 have been infected with the pneumonia-like virus, according to Wuhan health officials. There are now more than 570 confirmed cases, including some reported in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, the United States, Japan, South Korea and Thailand.
* * *
Update (0800ET): CNA, an English-language news website based across Asia, has just reported that Singapore has confirmed the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus.
In a media briefing on Thursday evening, the Ministry of Health said the carrier is a 66-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan. The man arrived in Singapore with his family on Jan. 20 after flying in from Guangzhou via China Southern. The man reported having a soar throat on the flight, but no fever.
Earlier, St. Petersburg reportedly confirmed its third case of the Wuhan virus.
The man traveled to Singapore General on Wednesday, and was immediately placed in isolation. He tested positive for the virus at 6 pm local time on Thursday. Singaporean authorities have already begun a contact tree, and are isolating all those with whom the suspect had contact.
The diagnosis is just the latest indication that, even as more Chinese cities cancel LNY celebrations, too many Chinese, including Chinese from Wuhan, have already traveled abroad. And the week-long holiday doesn’t even start until Saturday.
This live NYT map of confirmed Wuhan cases appears to be out-of-date, despite having just been updated.

The number of confirmed cases is closer to 600. Still, it gets the point across.
* * *
Update (0700ET): Beijing is reportedly planning to quarantine a third city in Hubei Province, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, while a fourth city in the province is planning to shut down train travel.
Media reports claim that Chibi, a city with half a million Chinese, will be quarantined like Wuhan and Huanggang. Meanwhile, Ezhou, a city with 1 million people in Hubei, is seeing some transportation shut down.
Meanwhile, officials in Beijing have joined several other Chinese cities in cancelling Chinese New Year celebrations.
#China locks down more cities due to #WuhanCoronavirus. Huanggang (7.5mln pop.) will suspend public bus, railway from midnight (11a ET). Internet cafes, movie theaters, tourist sites, entertainment venues temporarily closed. Ezhou (1mln pop.) said it shut train stations.

Conflicting report are alternatively claiming that Ezhou and Chibi will be the third Chinese city to face a quarantine. Does that mean officials are planning to quarantine the entire province?

As cases of the new coronavirus popped up around the globe, Chinese health officials managed to assuage the worries of the public, and the market, by insisting that the new, deadly coronavirus that emerged late last month in Wuhan had been ‘contained’ and that the outbreak would swiftly die down.
Despite imposing some draconian travel bans, it’s becoming increasingly clear that this isn’t going to happen. Even after quarantining an entire city of 11 million people – Wuhan is the 7th largest city in China and larger than any US city – experts are warning that it’s too late: The cat is already out of the bag.
But that won’t stop Beijing from trying: Now that Wuhan has been effectively cut off, Chinese officials announced another city-wide quarantine on Thursday: Huanggang city, which is in Hubei province and situated close to Wuhan, will suspend outbound train and bus services, as well as all bus services within the city effective Friday. All public places, including movie theaters, have been ordered to close until further notice, practically guaranteeing that the quarantine will take a bite out of GDP. Though even after authorities cut off all flights, Reuters reports that a few airlines were still running flights out of Wuhan.

As the SCMP pointed out, Wuhan, the city at the center of the outbreak, is five times larger than London.
The decision comes as more than 600 cases of the virus have now been confirmed. The death toll has been steady since yesterday at 17, as the WHO ponders whether to label the outbreak as a global pandemic risk.
Chinese state broadcasters shared images of Wuhan’s ghostly transport hubs, including the Hankou rail station, with all gates barred or blocked. Highway toll booths were shutting down as guards patrolled major highways. Inside the city, residents crowded into hospitals and rushed to buy up essential supplies from supermarkets and gas stations.
Interestingly, at least one Western journalist is reporting from Wuhan. We imagine Beijing allowed ABC access to the city to try and calm the growing panic in the West.

As more barriers rise, one well-known public health expert known for his work on the SARS outbreak warned that the quarantines likely wouldn’t be enough to stop the virus from becoming a global pandemic, according to the New York Times.
Dr. Guan Yi, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong who visited Wuhan earlier this week, warned there was a potential for the virus to spread rapidly despite the controls put in place Thursday morning.
“We have a chance to have a pandemic outbreak,” said Dr. Guan, who was part of the team that identified the coronavirus that caused the deadly SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003. SARS infected more than 8,000 people and killed nearly 800.
Dr. Guan also told Caixin, an influential Chinese magazine known for investigative reports, that he had traveled to Wuhan earlier in the week hoping to help track the virus’s animal source and control the epidemic. But he left, he said, feeling “powerless, very angry.”
Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who advised the Chinese government and the World Health Organization during the SARS outbreak, said that infected people outside Wuhan would continue to spread the disease.
“The horse is already out of the barn,” he said.
Another expert warned that there could already be as many as 4,000 cases of coronavirus in Wuhan, meaning that the vast majority of infections likely haven’t yet been reported.
Meanwhile, regulators around the world are scrambling to cut off flights from Wuhan (even though Beijing has supposedly cut off all rail and plane travel out of the city): The Philippines is the latest country to cut off flights from the city. The country’s Civil Aeronautics Board added that flights from elsewhere in China would be placed under ‘strict monitoring’, according to CNN Philippines. Manila, the Philippines’ crowded capital city, has started handing out 100,000 face masks.
The director of the country’s Civil Aeronautics Board explained that, even though Beijing is quarantining entire cities, it’s up to the Philippines to take their own steps to curb the outbreak.
“When you look at the seriousness of the outbreak, Wuhan should be the focus of attention,” CAB Executive Director Carmelo Arcilla told reporters.
“Even if they lift it, we have to look at our side first and make our own assessment. So our assessment is different from theirs, I mean, even their decision is different from ours,” Arcilla said.
Experts have warned that quarantining an entire city of 11 million would be virtually impossible. But the nabobs in Beijing refuse to be deterred: Videos circulating on social media show Chinese police setting up barricades across roads leading out of the city. Anybody in Wuhan who had New Year’s travel plans should probably cancel them and ask for a refund.

After a suspected case of coronavirus was discovered in Macau yesterday, officials in the special autonomous region warned that they might close all casinos in the territory, a move that would spoil the vacation plans of millions of Chinese planning to travel to Macau for the Chinese New Year. A second case was reportedly discovered on Thursday.
Across the world, a mildly risk-off mood is once again dominating markets. That means US stocks are one outbreak headline away from deeper declines.

New York Unemployment Site Goes Down After “Tens of Thousands” Lose Their Jobs,"

(ZH Opinion) — In many ways the US economy is currently in the eye of the coronavirus storm: cities and states are under quarantine lockdown, the CDC has prohibited any groupings of more than 50 people; stores, clubs, restaurants, bars and hotels are voluntarily shuttering indefinitely as the economy grinds to a halt and yet besides a tapestry of ghost cities across the nation, the immediate impact of the devastating viral storm on the service economy has yet to manifest itself.
But the hurricane is about to hit front and center, and the service-industry mecca of New York City is leading the way.
As the Daily News reports, New York’s unemployment website was overwhelmed Monday as the coronavirus pandemic put tens of thousands of people across the state out of work.

The flood of suddenly jobless workers hitting the Department of Labor website with applications for unemployment benefits was unleashed by a drastic move by Gov. Cuomo, who announced all of the state’s restaurants, bars, movie theaters, gyms and casinos would close by 8 p.m. Monday to contain the corona outbreak.
So many people tried to apply that the website crashed several times throughout the day, while the DOL’s hotline was so jammed up that callers seeking aid could not get through to someone who could handle their claim.
The unemployed can apply from 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays. DOL spokeswoman Deanna Cohen said the department saw a “spike in volume comparable to post 9/11,” adding there are more than 700 staffers assigned to handle the high demand.
“I’m completely unable to log in and apply” said 26-year-old Gabe Friedman, a drag queen who performs under the name Kiki Ball-Change. “Me and so many other drag queens are completely out of work for at least two months. If I pay rent at the end of April, I would be broke.”
It’s not just the drag queens that find themselves with zero demand for their unique “skills”: tens of thousands of workers across New York’s service industries have already been, or are about to be let go as their employers are forced to either shut down permanently or hibernate until the economy recovers.
The DOL on Sunday waived a seven-day waiting period on unemployment benefits for people out of work due to coronavirus — but that concession proved to be moot as many people could not apply at all.
Rita Lee, 57, who works in the film industry (hopefully not as a drag king), said she started to apply Sunday night after movie productions shut down across the city. She hit a wall once applications opened Monday.
From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Lee tried and failed to apply on the website, saying she kept “getting either a system or server error message, or the page will never load.”
“I’ve called all the toll-free numbers, which are recordings that redirect you to a main menu or a message saying that all the operators are overloaded now and to call back,” said Lee. “Can’t reach a human to help.”
David Stollings, a sound engineer at a now-shuttered Broadway theater, called the situation a doozy. “I got the site to load once,” said Stollings. “Before this it was just not loading at all.”
Marnia Halasa, a Manhattan-based figure skating coach, said she was also unable to apply and became worried about paying rent. “What if I have to blow the New York popsicle joint and run back to Ohio to live with my father?,” asked Halasa, who’s lived in the city for 28 years.
* * *
While it is not clear how many New Yorkers will lose their jobs due to the pandemic, Empire Center founder E.J. McMahon told the NYDN the hit could be worse than the Great Recession of the late 2000s when roughly 370,000 people lost their jobs in a more than two-year span.
“The website crashed, that’s evidence that there has never been anything like this so quickly,” said McMahon. “You can fix a computer glitch. But I don’t think the problem is how the safety net operates. I think the problem is how the economy operates in the future for all these people.”
Incidentally, the chief economist of a multi-billion macro hedge fund advised us that they are now modeling approximately 10 million job losses over the next two to three months. We leave it up to readers to decide if that’s too little, too much or just right.

"Amid National Quarantine, Italians Uplift Spirits by Singing From Balconies During Global Pandemic","

(TMU) — As 60 million people in Italy face an unprecedented government-ordered quarantine in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus, people are struggling to keep their spirits high as they cope with what amounts to a house arrest affecting the entire nation.
Restaurants, cafes, bars, retail spaces, movie theaters, and museums remain shut down until at least March 25, with only grocery stores, pharmacies, and newsstands remaining accessible to the people of the Mediterranean nation.
Despite it all, residents of Italy’s cities have taken to their balconies, terraces, and windows to sing patriotic songs, the national anthem, and old folk tunes as a means to cope with the worst national emergency the country has faced since World War II.
In one video shared to Twitter, residents of the Tuscan city of Siena can be heard at night uniting to sing popular folk song Canto della Verbena (And While Siena Sleeps). In the post, user valemercurii wrote:
“People of my hometown #Siena sing a popular song from their houses along an empty street to warm their hearts during the Italian #Covid_19 #lockdown.”

On Saturday, residents stuck in their homes clapped for several minutes in a dramatic gesture of thanks to the country’s medical professionals, hospital staff, and ambulance crews who have been working around the clock on the front lines of the CoViD-19 outbreak, treating, and helping the wave of patients infected by the deadly virus.

Emma Santachiara, 73, who joined the applause with her granddaughters from her apartment’s terrace in the Monteverde section of Rome, told the New York Times:
“It was from our hearts, to say thanks and show that we can get past this.” 
The social media posts have even spread as far as China, where the novel virus first emerged in December. The Guardian reports that Chinese social networks have shared the posts expressing solidarity with the people of Italy, saying “jiāyóu” which roughly translates to “add oil” or “keep up the fight” and “stay strong.”
Dramatic video from Wuhan, which has faced a lockdown since the end of January, depicts residents chanting “Wuhan jiāyóu” in a show of solidarity.

On Sunday, Italy reported that 368 people had died from the coronavirus in a 24-hour span, bringing the death toll from the novel virus to 1,809—the worst toll reported outside of China.
Hospitals in northern Italy have been stretched close to breaking point as the country scrambles to make up for its initial lack of preparedness and the confusion that greeted the virus.
But while the people of Italy are facing a trial that seemed unimaginable in modern times, they aren’t willing to take it lying down. Instead, their response to the tragedy has been infused with the sense of humor, musical bravado, and love for life that Italians are known for.

"All Hospital Beds in the US Will Be Filled by May 8th, According to Analysis","



Facebook







Twitter







Reddit







Email



(ZH) — A sobering analysis of how coronavirus is likely to impact the US health care system suggests that hospitals will be quickly overwhelmed with patients, and that all available beds will be filled by around May 8th if the virus tracks with Italy’s figures and 10% of patients require an ICU.
Of note, the Straits Times reported last week that thousands of people were waiting for hospital beds in South Korea as the disease surges.
Liz Specht, a PhD in biology and the associate director of Science and Technology for the Good Food Institute laid out her concerns in a lengthy Twitter thread on Friday, which you can see here on Twitter, or continue reading below.
Let’s conservatively assume that there are 2,000 current cases in the US today, March 6th. This is about 8x the number of confirmed (lab-diagnosed) cases. We know there is substantial under-Dx due to lack of test kits; I’ll address implications later of under-/over-estimate. 2/n
— Liz Specht (@LizSpecht) March 7, 2020

Continued: 
We can expect that we’ll continue to see a doubling of cases every 6 days (this is a typical doubling time across several epidemiological studies). Here I mean *actual* cases. Confirmed cases may appear to rise faster in the short term due to new test kit rollouts.
We’re looking at about 1M US cases by the end of April, 2M by ~May 5, 4M by ~May 11, and so on. Exponentials are hard to grasp, but this is how they go.
As the healthcare system begins to saturate under this case load, it will become increasingly hard to detect, track, and contain new transmission chains. In absence of extreme interventions, this likely won’t slow significantly until hitting >>1% of susceptible population.
What does a case load of this size mean for healthcare system? We’ll examine just two factors — hospital beds and masks — among many, many other things that will be impacted.
The US has about 2.8 hospital beds per 1000 people. With a population of 330M, this is ~1M beds. At any given time, 65% of those beds are already occupied. That leaves about 330k beds available nationwide (perhaps a bit fewer this time of year with regular flu season, etc).
Let’s trust Italy’s numbers and assume that about 10% of cases are serious enough to require hospitalization. (Keep in mind that for many patients, hospitalization lasts for *weeks* — in other words, turnover will be *very* slow as beds fill with COVID19 patients).
By this estimate, by about May 8th, all open hospital beds in the US will be filled. (This says nothing, of course, about whether these beds are suitable for isolation of patients with a highly infectious virus.)
If we’re wrong by a factor of two regarding the fraction of severe cases, that only changes the timeline of bed saturation by 6 days in either direction. If 20% of cases require hospitalization, we run out of beds by ~May 2nd.
If only 5% of cases require it, we can make it until ~May 14th. 2.5% gets us to May 20th. This, of course, assumes that there is no uptick in demand for beds from *other* (non-COVID19) causes, which seems like a dubious assumption.
As healthcare system becomes increasingly burdened, Rx shortages, etc, people w/ chronic conditions that are normally well-managed may find themselves slipping into severe states of medical distress requiring intensive care & hospitalization. But let’s ignore that for now.
Alright, so that’s beds. Now masks. Feds say we have a national stockpile of 12M N95 masks and 30M surgical masks (which are not ideal, but better than nothing).
There are about 18M healthcare workers in the US. Let’s assume only 6M HCW are working on any given day. (This is likely an underestimate as most people work most days of the week, but again, I’m playing conservative at every turn.)
As COVID19 cases saturate virtually every state and county, which seems likely to happen any day now, it will soon be irresponsible for all HCWs to not wear a mask. These HCWs would burn through N95 stockpile in 2 days if each HCW only got ONE mask per day.
One per day would be neither sanitary nor pragmatic, though this is indeed what we saw in Wuhan, with HCWs collapsing on their shift from dehydration because they were trying to avoid changing their PPE suits as they cannot be reused.
How quickly could we ramp up production of new masks? Not very fast at all. The vast majority are manufactured overseas, almost all in China. Even when manufactured here in US, the raw materials are predominantly from overseas… again, predominantly from China.
Keep in mind that all countries globally will be going through the exact same crises and shortages simultaneously. We can’t force trade in our favor.
Now consider how these 2 factors – bed and mask shortages – compound each other’s severity. Full hospitals + few masks + HCWs running around between beds without proper PPE = very bad mix.
HCWs are already getting infected even w/ access to full PPE. In the face of PPE limitations this severe, it’s only a matter of time. HCWs will start dropping from the workforce for weeks at a time, leading to a shortage of HCWs that then further compounds both issues above.
We could go on and on about thousands of factors – # of ventilators, or even simple things like saline drip bags. You see where this is going.
Importantly, I cannot stress this enough: even if I’m wrong – even VERY wrong – about core assumptions like % of severe cases or current case #, it only changes the timeline by days or weeks. This is how exponential growth in an immunologically naïve population works.
Undeserved panic does no one any good. But neither does ill-informed complacency. It’s wrong to assuage the public by saying “only 2% will die.” People aren’t adequately grasping the national and global systemic burden wrought by this swift-moving of a disease.
I’m an engineer. This is what my mind does all day: I run back-of-the-envelope calculations to try to estimate order-of-magnitude impacts. I’ve been on high alarm about this disease since ~Jan 19 after reading clinical indicators in the first papers emerging from Wuhan.
Nothing in the last 6 weeks has dampened my alarm in the slightest. To the contrary, we’re seeing abject refusal of many countries to adequately respond or prepare. Of course some of these estimates will be wrong, even substantially wrong.
But I have no reason to think they’ll be orders-of-magnitude wrong. Even if your personal risk of death is very, very low, don’t mock decisions like canceling events or closing workplaces as undue “panic”.
These measures are the bare minimum we should be doing to try to shift the peak – to slow the rise in cases so that healthcare systems are less overwhelmed. Each day that we can delay an extra case is a big win for the HC system.
And yes, you really should prepare to buckle down for a bit. All services and supply chains will be impacted. Why risk the stress of being ill-prepared?
Worst case, I’m massively wrong and you now have a huge bag of rice and black beans to burn through over the next few months and enough Robitussin to trip out.
One more thought: you’ve probably seen multiple respected epidemiologists have estimated that 20-70% of world will be infected within the next year. If you use 6-day doubling rate I mentioned above, we land at ~2-6 billion infected by sometime in July of this year.
Obviously I think the doubling time will start to slow once a sizeable fraction of the population has been infected, simply because of herd immunity and a smaller susceptible population.
But take the scenarios above (full beds, no PPE, etc, at just 1% of the US population infected) and stretch them out over just a couple extra months.
That timeline roughly fits with consensus end-game numbers from these highly esteemed epidemiologists. Again, we’re talking about discrepancies of mere days or weeks one direction or another, but not disagreements in the overall magnitude of the challenge.
This is not some hypothetical, fear-mongering, worst-case scenario. This is reality, as far as anyone can tell with the current available data.
That’s all for now. Standard disclaimers apply: I’m a PhD biologist but *not* an epidemiologist. Thoughts my own. Yadda yadda. Stay safe out there. /end

Student Suspended From School After Selling ‘Squirts’ of Hand Sanitizer to Classmates,"

(TMU) — An enterprising young teenager in the United Kingdom was suspended from school for a day after selling “squirts” of hand sanitizer to his fellow classmates.
The boy, a student at Dixons Unity Academy in Leeds, has been praised by netizens for his efforts to flip the precious liquid for a few quid as hysteria over the coronavirus continues to grip the world.
In a post to Facebook that has since gone viral, the boy’s mother Jenny Tompkins noted that the “little turd” had been sent home for his entrepreneurial exploits. She wrote:
“Well the little turd has just been expelled from school for the day after been caught charging students 50p a squirt for hand sanitiser to protect themselfs [sic] from the bloody corona virus!!”
“Very hard to discipline this behaviour when his dad phones him from work to call him a fucking legend,” Tompkins added.
The post, which has already been shared nearly 200 thousand times since it was shared on Wednesday, has been inundated with comments praising the lad.

Posted by Jenny Tompkins on Wednesday, March 11, 2020
One user commented:
“Why are the school complaining, he’s thinking outside the box and offering something useful better than him selling drugs!”
While another wrote:
“Best thing I’ve read all day by far. Chin up lass, you’ve raised an entrepreneur.”
In total, the young boy raised approximately £9—or a little over $11 USD—after selling the squirts for roughly 64 cents each.
According to his mother, he bought some Doritos with his earnings and plans to buy a kebab with the rest of his cash.
While the boy’s attempts to seize the opportunity in the crisis have been hailed by some social media users and publicized by the world press, there have also been unscrupulous attempts at price-gouging consumers gripped by fear of the novel virus.
On Tuesday, the Japanese government announced that it would make the reselling of masks a crime punishable by a one-year prison term or ¥1 million ($9,800) fine, or both.
The move comes after a provincial lawmaker was exposed to have made ¥8.9 million ($85,000) by selling packets of 2,000 face masks online in auctions for ¥30,000 to ¥170,000 each.
Last Friday, e-commerce giant eBay announced that it would ban U.S. sales listings of hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes, and N95 and N100 masks to halt a surge in price-gouging slamming consumers who are desperate to ensure that they and their families are protected from the viral outbreak. The move came after the prices of critical supplies skyrocketed on online platforms, potentially violating price-gouging laws in some U.S. states.
However, a number of disinfectant products, gas masks, respirator masks, and assorted disposable masks are still available on eBay.

(CONVERSATION) – In the space of a few weeks, we have all learned a lot about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it: SARS-CoV-2. But there have also been a lot of rumours.
And while the number of scientific articles on this virus is increasing, there are still many grey areas as to its origins.
In which animal species did it occur? A bat, a pangolin or another wild species? Where does it come from? From a cave or a forest in the Chinese province of Hubei, or elsewhere?
In December 2019, 27 of the first 41 people hospitalised (66 percent) passed through a market located in the heart of Wuhan city in Hubei province. But, according to a study conducted at Wuhan Hospital, the very first human case identified did not frequent this market.
Instead, a molecular dating estimate based on the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences indicates an origin in November. This raises questions about the link between this COVID-19 epidemic and wildlife.
The SARS-CoV-2 genome was rapidly sequenced by Chinese researchers. It is an RNA molecule of about 30,000 bases containing 15 genes, including the S gene which codes for a protein located on the surface of the viral envelope (for comparison, our genome is in the form of a double helix of DNA about 3 billion bases in size and contains about 30,000 genes).
Comparative genomic analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the group of Betacoronaviruses and that it is very close to SARS-CoV, responsible for an epidemic of acute pneumonia which appeared in November 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong and then spread to 29 countries in 2003.
A total of 8,098 cases were recorded, including 774 deaths. It is known that bats of the genus Rhinolophus (potentially several cave species) were the reservoir of this virus and that a small carnivore, the palm civet (Paguma larvata), may have served as an intermediate host between bats and the first human cases.
Since then, many Betacoronaviruses have been discovered, mainly in bats, but also in humans. For example, RaTG13, isolated from a bat of the species Rhinolophus affinis collected in China’s Yunan Province, has recently been described as very similar to SARS-CoV-2, with genome sequences identical to 96 percent.
These results indicate that bats, and in particular species of the genus Rhinolophus, constitute the reservoir of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses.
But how do you define a reservoir? A reservoir is one or several animal species that are not or not very sensitive to the virus, which will naturally host one or several viruses.
The absence of symptoms of the disease is explained by the effectiveness of their immune system, which allows them to fight against too much viral proliferation.
On 7 February, 2020, we learned that a virus even closer to SARS-CoV-2 had been discovered in pangolin. With 99 percent of genomic concordance reported, this suggested a more likely reservoir than bats.
However, a recent study under review shows that the genome of the coronavirus isolated from the Malaysian pangolin (Manis javanica) is less similar to SARS-Cov-2, with only 90 percent of genomic concordance. This would indicate that the virus isolated in the pangolin is not responsible for the COVID-19 epidemic currently raging.
However, the coronavirus isolated from pangolin is similar at 99 percent in a specific region of the S protein, which corresponds to the 74 amino acids involved in the ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2) receptor binding domain, the one that allows the virus to enter human cells to infect them.
By contrast, the virus RaTG13 isolated from bat R. affinis is highly divergent in this specific region (only 77 percent of similarity). This means that the coronavirus isolated from pangolin is capable of entering human cells whereas the one isolated from bat R. affinis is not.
In addition, these genomic comparisons suggest that the SARS-Cov-2 virus is the result of a recombination between two different viruses, one close to RaTG13 and the other closer to the pangolin virus. In other words, it is a chimera between two pre-existing viruses.
This recombination mechanism had already been described in coronaviruses, in particular to explain the origin of SARS-CoV. It is important to know that recombination results in a new virus potentially capable of infecting a new host species.
For recombination to occur, the two divergent viruses must have infected the same organism simultaneously.
Two questions remain unanswered: in which organism did this recombination occur? (a bat, a pangolin or another species?) And above all, under what conditions did this recombination take place?

John Bolton Disbanded Global Health Security Team in Charge of Pandemic Response Efforts,"

(TMU) — Dr. Dena Grayson, a medical doctor, researcher, and politician with years worth of training developing Ebola treatments under her belt, has expressed concern about a pivotal moment that was largely overlooked back in May 2018.
Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer, Senior Director for Global Health Security and Biodefense at the National Security Council starting in April 2017, was responsible for leading pandemic preparedness and response efforts but abruptly left the position in 2018. Following his departure, the team he oversaw was disbanded by then national security adviser John Bolton.
I have extensive experience with #Ebola & remember being VERY concerned when this happened.👇🏼
It’s not if—it’s WHEN—a global pandemic will happen. And preparedness and rapid response are critical to containing the damage.
TOTAL INCOMPETENCE.🤬#2019nCovhttps://t.co/3K6NY6loiv
— Dr. Dena Grayson (@DrDenaGrayson) January 27, 2020

Jamil Smith, senior writing at Rolling Stone, likewise sounded the alarm on Monday.
Remember that the top White House official responsible for leading the U.S. response to a pandemic left in 2018. He wasn’t replaced. John Bolton, still the national security adviser then, immediately disbanded the official’s global health security team. https://t.co/8aBiL0B4nE
— Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) January 27, 2020

A May 2018 article in the Independent said that the “breakup of his team, comes at a time when many experts say the country is already underprepared for the increasing risks of a pandemic or bioterrorism attack.” This statement is all the more real in January 2020 as the world faces what could be global pandemic as cases of 2019-nCoV continue to increase rapidly in China while spreading slowly across the globe.
According to Ronald Klain, who served as the U.S. Ebola response coordinator from late 2014 to early 2015 and was chief of staff to both Al Gore and Joe Biden during their vice presidential terms, Ziemer was forced out by John Bolton. 
He didn’t quit: Bolton forced him out. https://t.co/1kdUlsz3kq

Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer’s departure left no senior official in charge of global health security.
It is currently unclear what department or person may have taken over some or all of Ziemer’s responsibilities. However, U.S. President Donald Trump did release a “fact sheet” approximately one year after Ziemer’s departure and the disbanding of the team.
The May 2019 fact sheet states that, “President Donald J. Trump is taking action to protect America and our partners from infectious disease threats” by releasing the Global Health Security Strategy, a strategy the fact sheet claims is the first of its kind.
The strategy, which can be read here in full, will adopt “a whole-of-government approach” to national health security by combining the strengths of different departments and agencies and “defines the actions the Administration will take to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats, whether naturally occurring, accidental, or deliberate.”
In section IV, the strategy states that, in response to international outbreaks, it will:
“Because an infectious disease can spread rapidly to all parts of the world, endangering lives and economies, the United States Government will continue to monitor and respond to international outbreaks through several mechanisms, including CDC’s Global Disease Detection Operations Center (GDDOC), CDC’s IDRRRF, and USAID’s Emergency Reserve Fund for infectious disease outbreaks (ERF).”
The strategy goes on to detail what each participating agency and department should do but does not highly who is in charge of the overall efforts, a task that likely would fallen on Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer. What’s more, while the strategy does note participation from the National Security Council, it does not indicate a person.
As seen in the screen shot below, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit that focuses on national health issues and the U.S.’ involvement in global health policy, the position of Director for Global Health and International Development sits vacant—or at least was vacant on January 17 when the list was published or last updated.

However, Ziemer’s position was Senior Director for Global Health Security and Biodefense at the National Security Council (NSC)—a position that isn’t found on the list above. It is interesting to note that of the seven NSC global health positions included in the list, four of them are specific to weapons of mass destruction, biodefense, and biological threats while none of them are specific to overall global health.
Heather Cox Richardson, Professor of history at Boston College, said in a now viral Facebook post:
“But the implications of the destruction of our government might well soon become terrifyingly clear. I actually wrote about the new coronavirus the day it was announced because it hit a number of issues that, as a historian, I thought were important. But I deleted the paragraph, afraid that readers who are already on edge would become unnecessarily worried (I did leave it in the notes for that day as a record for future scholars). For the purposes of this political record, though, we should note that the GOP project of dismantling the government means that we have not had anyone in charge of leading the U.S. response to a pandemic since May 2018, when Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer from the National Security Council was pushed out during a shake up by then-National Security Advisor John Bolton, who broke up the team designed to focus on global health security.
Strap in, folks. All signs suggest this is going to be quite a week.”
In a series of tweets Dr. Grayson has been detailing her concern regarding the coronavirus that is thought to have emerged in Wuhan.
 In addition to being highly contagious, this novel #coronavirus can cause a SEVERE infection that can kill even healthy people. It’s rare to see BOTH of these (bad) attributes in the same novel virus. Usually, it’s one or the other.
Thus far, the case-fatality rate appears to be ~4%…but its’ WAY too early to know what it really is, due to spotty reporting (both of deaths and cases), and because patients are still sick and could die tomorrow, next week, etc., even if no new infections occur.
I get asked: “How will I know if I have the #coronavirus?”
Answer: it’s very hard to tell, because the symptoms are similar to having influenza — anywhere on the spectrum from a very bad cold to severe pneumonia with respiratory compromise.
#China has a history of not accurately reporting outbreaks, so it’s hard to know exactly what is happening, especially with no free press, internet, etc.
China’s massive response is VERY telling and strongly suggests that the #CoronavirusOutbreak is VERY bad, especially in Wuhan 
Right now, the risk appears low in the US, with only a few isolated cases. Unfortunately, I expect that this will change, as more cases arise here, especially with global travel and how readily this #coronavirus appears to spread (via droplets in the air).
#CoronavirusOutbreak 
And most importantly, Dr. Grayson responds to questions on how the global population can best protect themselves.
How can you protect yourself and others?
1. Avoid contact with people who are visibly ill (even loved ones)2. Stay home if YOU are sick3. Cover your nose/mouth with a tissue (not hand) when coughing/sneezing4. Don't touch your face (difficult)5. Wash your hands frequently
— Dr. Dena Grayson (@DrDenaGrayson) January 25, 2020

It remains unclear what led to the ouster of Ziemer and Bolton’s disbanding of the team.
Following Ziemer’s departure from his position with the NSC, he returned to the controversial USAID where he was perviously led President Bush’s Malaria Initiative. Ziemer is now Senior Deputy Assistant Administrator for the Bureau for Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance (DCHA) at USAID.

Police in California Plan to Use Drones to Enforce Quarantine Lockdown,"

(TMU) — In the months since the CoViD-19 pandemic began, governments around the world have been utilizing a wide range of technological devices to enforce quarantines. Advanced surveillance and tracking have been made possible by cellphone data, CCTV cameras, and drones.
Surveillance drones were used during the lockdown in China to monitor neighborhoods to ensure that residents were staying indoors. Drones were also used to spray disinfectants during the outbreak as well.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged additional governments to use similar tactics to enforce quarantines. Police in Spain have been using drones to patrol the streets and order citizens to stay home during the lockdown.

Most Americans doubted that these types of measures would happen at home, but police in California have already announced a plan to use drones equipped with cameras and loudspeakers to enforce the recently imposed quarantine orders.
In Chula Vista, a town just outside of San Diego, police purchased at least two drones from the Chinese company DJI for $11,000 each.
Vern Sallee, one of the city’s police captains, told the Financial Times that the drones could be used to “disperse crowds” without the need for a human officer to be involved.
“We have not traditionally mounted speakers to our drones, but . . . if we need to cover a large area to get an announcement out, or if there were a crowd somewhere that we needed to disperse—we could do it without getting police officers involved,” Sallee said.
“The outbreak has changed my view of expanding the program as rapidly as I can,” he added.
Sallee also suggested that the drones could be used to give homeless people updates or orders about the pandemic, since many of them may not have access to the Internet and may be unaware of the current situation.
“We need to tell them we actually have resources for them—they are vulnerable right now. It might be impractical or unsafe for our officers to be put into those areas,” Sallee said.
Spencer Gore, chief executive of Impossible Aerospace, a California-based maker of high-performance drones used by first responders, admitted that the idea “seems a little Orwellian,” but insisted that it could “save lives.”
“What we saw in China, and what we’re probably going to see around the world, is using drones with cameras and loudspeakers to fly around to see if people are gathering where they shouldn’t be, and telling them to go home,” Gore said.

(TMU) — News about the novel coronavirus spreading throughout the United States and across the world is developing rapidly.
It can be difficult and overwhelming to keep up with everything happening so we’ve sifted through hundreds of articles and pulled out what we feel are the most important developments of the last 24 hours so you don’t have to.
Here are five huge developments that you need to know about the global outbreak of COVID-19 and the novel coronavirus.


🦠 The Latest COVID-19 Updates You Need to Know! 🦠
Posted by Emma Leigh on Thursday, March 5, 2020
Yale professor, radiologist, and healthcare management expert Howard Forman warns, “There is absolutely going to be an explosion in the number of identified cases. But how fast that number increases is highly dependent on how fast we can test.” Forman said that testing for coronavirus is an integral part in controlling the spread, adding that the U.S is not doing enough and efforts thus far have been “woefully inadequate.”
King County, Washington has encouraged its 2.2 million residents to stay home for the next three weeks. The county that includes the city of Seattle, is suggesting that anyone over the age of 60 stay indoors, that people telecommute rather than physically go into work, and that residents refrain from licking their mail-in ballots for the upcoming March 10 primary. 
Placer County, California declared a local health emergency after reporting a second confirmed case of the virus. The newest case was traced to a Grand Princess cruise ship that had departed San Francisco in mid-February. While the patient had been reported to be “critically ill,” it was later confirmed that the elderly man passed away.
This latest death brings the U.S. official death count to eleven, according to the La Times.
The Grand Princess cruise ship is expected to arrive off the coast of San Francisco on Thursday as the CDC investigates a “small cluster” of coronavirus cases associated with its previous voyage. California’s Governor said in a Wednesday press conference that the ship will be held off the coast and not allowed to dock.
Los Angeles County, California also declared a state of emergency as six new cases of the virus were confirmed on Tuesday night.  
NBC reported that a CDC contractor tasked with screening passengers at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) just tested positive for the virus.
California Governor Newson has now declared a state of emergency for the entire state of California after the state confirmed a total of 53 cases of COVID-19 as of Wednesday afternoon. Newsome said in a statement, “The State of California is deploying every level of government to help identify cases and slow the spread of this coronavirus. This emergency proclamation will help the state further prepare our communities and our health care system in the event it spreads more broadly.”
More than 8,000 people are being monitored in California, according to the Independent.
A New Hampshire hospital worker became the state’s first case on Monday and was ordered to self-isolate. However, the patient who was confirmed to be infected defied orders and instead attended a local event. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement, “The first patient, despite having been directed to self-isolate, attended an invitation-only private event on Friday.” Healthcare works warned all attendees at the event that took place in Vermont to “follow the recommended 14-day self-isolation.”
New Jersey has announced its first COVID-19 case. The patient, a male in his 30s, has been hospitalized since March 3.

And in New York, 1,000 people have been told to self-quarantine following new cases in Westchester, New York.
The U.S military has confirmed two new cases of the virus found in relatives of troops in South Korea. At the same time South Korea has declared what it is calling a “special care zone” around a second city hit by the virus.
The Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, China thought to be ground zero for the deadly outbreak of COVID-19 has reportedly been demolished two months after it was shuttered. According to a Lancet study, 66 percent of patients suffering from the virus in Wuhan hospitals as of early January had been exposed to the market. Conflicting reports about the market’s involvement in the outbreak continue to emerge.

Australia has banned travels from South Korea and instituted enhanced screenings of visitors from Italy in an attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus, according to Prime Minister Scott Morrison. He also indicated there would be a ban on travers from China and Iran.
According to India Today, at least 15 Italian have tested positive while visiting other countries.

In Israel, around 100,000 people are currently in quarantine. During a press conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, “We have to understand, we are in the midst of a global epidemic, the most dangerous of these epidemics in the last 100 years.”
Iraq has reported the country’s first two confirmed cases of COVID-19, according to the BBC.
As what Germany’s Health Minister Jens Spahn is now calling a “worldwide pandemic” grows, researchers have identified two different strains of the virus. One strain is reportedly less aggressive than the other. According to the study, 30 percent of strains studied were the aggressive type. Researches say the aggressive virus began to decrease in prevalence in early 2020.
China has reported that a 36-year-old recovered COVID-19 patient fell ill five days after recovering and being discharged from the hospital and died. It is unclear which strain of the virus he had.
Panic buying across the world continues as people prepare for possible quarantine and shortages of goods. On Wednesday, Australia’s biggest supermarket chain announced a limit on the amount of toilet paper that could be purchased. Woolworths said, “to ensure more customers have access to the products,” customers would be limited to four packs of toilet paper per person. The chain has also moved hand sanitizers behind the service counter and has placed a limit of two per person.
Across social media, Americans are sharing stories of finding empty store shelves but online retailers are also feeling the stress of panic buying. Amazon Prime Now, Instacart, and Walmart have all been overwhelmed by the increase in orders and are expecting delivery delays. Social media users have reported dousing items they’ve ordering online in products like Lysol before opening.
Amidst the increase in buying, the World Health Organization suggested that contaminated money may be spreading the virus that remains on surfaces for days and suggested people use “contactless payment methods” instead.
Italy’s COVID-19 death toll rose to 79 as the country orders all classrooms throughout the country to close until mid-March. Italy also plans to close theaters and ban public events across the country, according to Yahoo.
Almost 300 million students throughout the world are home from school this week.
Greece is the latest country to close schools and universities as well as cancel large public gatherings.
Despite recording the highest numbers of cases and deaths in the United States, Washington officials have not yet ordered schools to close in the state. King County health officer Jeffrey Duchin acknowledged the need to “keep our society functioning, our businesses functioning and schools functioning.” Duchin said schools in county will close only after there is a confirmed case associated with that school.
However, Facebook Inc. has decided to close its Seattle office after a contractor was diagnosed.

“Doesn’t Even Look Real”: Los Angeles Morphs Into “Ghost Town” Amid Outbreak,"

(ZH) — Last week we documented how the Seattle Metropolitan Area morphed into a ghost town amid the Covid-19 outbreak.
Now, the staff at the Los Angeles Times has taken out their quadcopter to record how strict distancing measures in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area have changed the everyday life for millions of people.
Traffic on the 110 Freeway, heading north out of Downtown Los Angeles is usually jam-packed with cars, but with Gov. Gavin Newsom requesting all Californians to “shelter-in-place,” highways in the area have virtually no vehicles on them.

With nonessential gatherings banned, residents are limited to leaving their homes. Places like Pershing Square in Downtown Los Angeles is now closed off to the public.

All nonessential businesses across the state have been forced to close, which includes shopping malls and entertainment centers. LA Times’ staff snapped a picture of an empty parking lot at the Westfield Topanga & The Village shopping mall.

With social gatherings banned, basketball courts at the Royal Learning Center in Central Los Angeles are empty.

One table was occupied this weekend at the Cal Marketplace in Downtown Los Angeles.

The beach in Santa Monica was deserted except for two millennials and a homeless man behind them getting rays.


Thanks to Twitter, here are spookier views of an empty Los Angeles as millions shelter in their homes during the virus crisis:

China Sends One Million Surgical Masks and Gloves to Help France Fight Coronavirus,"

(TMU) — China is shipping one million surgical masks and gloves to France to help it fight the coronavirus, the French foreign minister confirmed on Wednesday.
France, which has suffered shortages of masks and gloves, had provided China with roughly 17 tons of equipment after the novel virus broke out in Wuhan last December.
The shipment also comes after French President Emmanuel Macron declared that his country is “at war” against CoViD-19, echoing a general sentiment across Europe which has become the new flashpoint of a global pandemic that has seen thousands killed, borders slammed shut, and citizens forced to stay at home across the world.
On Wednesday, French health authorities reported 89 new deaths from the virus, which represents a massive spike by nearly 51 percent, taking the total number of deaths to 264. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 9,134, up from 7,730 on Tuesday, health agency director Jerome Salomon told reporters.
China has also shipped nine of its medical staff and planeloads of medical supplies totaling 30 tons to Italy, Europe’s hardest-hit nation, which saw deaths rise by 475 on Wednesday to nearly 3,000, marking the biggest single increase in mortality since the outbreak began.

Financial Times reports that European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen thanked China on Wednesday for its offer to provide over 2 million medical masks and 50,000 coronavirus testing kits. Von der Leyen told reporters that she had spoken to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and the two agreed that China and the EU must “support each other in times of need.”
In spite of Beijing’s efforts to aid other countries slammed hard by the outbreak, China has still received negative press in the West, while the Trump administration has referred to CoViD-19 variously as the “Chinese virus,” “Wuhan virus,” or even “Kung Flu.”
Beijing’s eagerness to assist countries stricken by the disease strikingly contrasts with the seeming disinterest Washington has displayed during the crisis toward its traditional western allies, one critic observed.
In an article for China Daily, Fraser Cameron, director of the Brussels-based EU-Asia Centre think-tank, wrote:
“The pandemic is thus having a major impact on EU-US-China relations. It has disrupted trade and travel, and sparked a national rather than an international response. In an ideal world, there would be no talk of a ‘foreign virus’; instead, there would be acknowledgement that a pathogen knows no borders and has no political loyalties. 
The pandemic is a common threat that requires a coordinated global response. But that is not the way the US administration thinks and thus the US’ relations with both the EU and China may continue to suffer.”

"Bernie Sanders Says US Gov’t Should Pay Every American $2,000 per Month Until Pandemic Ends","

(CD) — Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders put forth a far-reaching plan Tuesday night that calls for at least $2 trillion in emergency funding—including for free healthcare and direct cash payments of $2,000 per month to every American—as a way to “mobilize on a scale not seen since the New Deal and World War II to prevent deaths, job losses, and economic ruin” caused by the deadly and growing threat of the coronavirus outbreak now sweeping the United States and much of the world.
“In terms of potential deaths and the impact on our economy, the crisis we face from coronavirus is on the scale of a major war, and we must act accordingly,” Sanders said in Tuesday night address. “We must begin thinking on a scale comparable to the threat, and make sure that we are protecting working people, low-income people, and the most vulnerable communities, not just giant corporations and Wall Street.”
The new plan—which Sanders set out in a live-streamed address just before polls closed in the primary voting states of Illinois, Florida, and Arizona—gives new policy details to his repeated call that the response to the coronavirus, officially known as COVID-19, be adequately robust and specifically targeted to help those who need it most and done in a way that centers both the short-term and long-term health of the nation’s people and its economy.
While former Vice President Joe Biden was declared the winner in each of Tuesday’s primary contests—adding to his already substantial delegate lead—the release of the new plan by Sanders made it clear that the Vermont senator still believes he has a role to play and a vision to share with the nation even as his prospects for winning the Democratic nomination continue to diminish.
“In this moment of crisis, it is imperative that we stand together,” Sanders said. Referencing people in the U.S. already out of work, those sick or fearful that they or someone they love could become sick, and everyone worried about their ability to get tested or treatment if they need—Sanders emphasized how it is now essential that the needs of working people and the most vulnerable in society are put before corporate interests or those seeking to profit in the midst of the society-wide shock.
The plan would guarantee that all healthcare needs related to the coronavirus would be free and available to all, including testing, any treatments, and ultimately—when available—the vaccine. The plan also calls for a dramatic investment in the public health system—including an urgent overhaul in terms of testing for the virus—and increased preparedness and support for frontline medical workers, hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. It would also mobilize the National Guard, Army Corps of Engineers, and military resources to build healthcare capacity nationwide.
On the economic front, Sanders’ plan would issue direct cash payments, in the form of $2,000 check to every American each month for the duration of the crisis. The plan would also establish what the Sanders campaign calls the “Emergency Economic Crisis Finance Agency,” which would be charged with handling the financial downturn unleashed by what is now a global pandemic.
“We must guarantee that everyone who needs care can get it for free, ensure that all workers continue to receive paychecks so they can make ends meet,” Sanders said, “and stop giant corporations and Wall Street from profiting off the outbreak.”
Bernie's proposal also extends unemployment benefits to tipped workers, gig workers, domestic workers, freelancers & independent contractors to make up for the income they lose during this crisis. https://t.co/9G1x0tPJ1c pic.twitter.com/UcR6jqU2Pc

According to the Sanders campaign, the three basic principles of his plan are:
Empower Medicare to Ensure That Everyone Receives Health Care
Establish an Emergency Economic Crisis Finance Agency to Manage the Economic Crisis
Create an Oversight Agency to Fight Corporate Corruption and Price-Gouging
Each principle was layed out in detailed new plan—called “An Emergency Response to the Coronavirus Pandemic“—posted on the campaign’s website. Sanders also detailed the plan in his live address to the nation streamed Tuesday evening. Watch it in full:

In his remarks, Sanders said the nation is now facing a series of interlocking crises—including the spread of the infectious virus, an economic meltdown triggered by the outbreak, and a political disaster stemming from the mishandling of the catastrophe by the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress.
While he admitted he did not have all the answers—and called on the American people to rise up and voice their demands—he said he would be bringing his plan to his fellow lawmakers in Congress immediately in an effort to urgently implement proposals in line with the policies and principles he has set forth.

The NBA also announced that a member of the Utah Jazz has tested positive for CoViD-19. Sources told ESPN that the infected player is Rudy Gobert.
The NBA “will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic.”
On Wednesday night, speaking from his desk at the White House, Trump said he was taking “strong but necessary” actions by suspending all travel from Europe for the 30 days starting on Friday. However, the new restrictions will not apply to Britain.
Posts are popping up across social media with reaction to the ban. A reporter from CNN shared the following video taken at JFK International Airport in New York City that was provided to him by a friend. What appears to be an airline employee is seen the crowd they won’t be forced to travel and their bags will be retrieved if they decide not to fly to Dublin tonight.

Mike Pence Shook Hands With Classmates of Student Under Coronavirus Quarantine,"

(TMU) — Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a public health emergency this week after two people in the state tested positive for COVID-19.
One of the sick residents is an adult with no clear link to the countries where the virus is widespread, leading some to believe there are many other cases and carriers in the state that have not yet been tested.
Health officials are also putting contacts of these patients into quarantine as a matter of precaution because this virus is so contagious. One of the people in quarantine for this reason happens to be a student whose classmates shook hands with Vice President Mike Pence last week.
On Friday, just days after being named by Donald Trump as the head of the outbreak response task force, Pence was at Sarasota Military Academy in Florida shaking hands with cadets and posing for photographs.
Of course, the student who is at risk was in quarantine and not at the event with Mike Pence, but a coronavirus patient was mere points of unprotected contact away from the President of the United States.
Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, said that the student and his mother are in quarantine as a precaution, but they have not shown symptoms of the virus themselves.
Can we all take a deep breath? @Mike_Pence did not meet or come into contact at all with this student. https://t.co/uLzvnVcoS4
— Katie Miller (@VPPressSec) March 3, 2020

According to a statement from the school, the student’s mother reportedly cared for one of the sick patients in a medical capacity at Sarasota Doctors Hospital. 
No other details about the case are available.

One of our students and his mother are currently quarantined as a precautionary measure due to the mother's contact with…
Posted by Sarasota Military Academy on Monday, March 2, 2020
Studies have shown that the incubation period for the virus is unusually long and that it is possible for people to be carriers of the virus even if they aren’t exhibiting symptoms themselves. Pence should be at least a little bit nervous that he was only a few points of contact away from an infected individual. We can only hope that the Vice President is following the CDC’s advice about social distancing and hand washing, but that doesn’t appear to be the case, as evidenced by the viral video below.

Satellite Images Show Massive Decline in Pollution Over Italy Amid Outbreak and Quarantine,"

(TMU) — In a clear illustration of the disruptive effect that the coronavirus has had on Italy, satellite imagery has shown a massive decrease in air pollution over the country as the government struggles to gain an upper-hand on the crisis by placing all residents under strict quarantine measures on a national level.
The imagery compares air pollution levels, specifically nitrogen dioxide emissions, between January 1 and March 11, and is based on data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite. Images taken over China in February also revealed a drop in pollution.
In a press release, the European Space Agency (ESA) noted that the reduction has been particularly striking in northern Italy, which “coincides with its nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.”
Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission manager Claus Zehner said:
“The decline in nitrogen dioxide emissions over the Po Valley in northern Italy is particularly evident. Although there could be slight variations in the data due to cloud cover and changing weather, we are very confident that the reduction in emissions that we can see coincides with the lockdown in Italy, causing less traffic and industrial activities.
These measurements, globally available thanks to the free and open data policy, provide crucial information for citizens and decision makers.”
Josef Aschbacher, ESA’s Director of Earth Observation Programs, added:
“Copernicus Sentinel-5P Tropomi is the most accurate instrument today that measures air pollution from space.
These measurements, globally available thanks to the free and open data policy, provide crucial information for citizens and decision makers.”
New data from @CopernicusEU #Sentinel5P reveal decline of air pollution, specifically NO2 emissions, over Italy.

On Monday, Italian authorities reported an additional 349 deaths resulting from the novel virus, raising the total death toll from the outbreak to at least 2,158.
The figures from the Italian Civil Protection Department show that the number of infections is continuing to rise, climbing 12 percent from Sunday to reach 23,073.
The government’s unprecedented and stringent measures are meant to curb the lethal spread of the virus, which was initially met with a lack of preparedness and confusion on the part of state authorities and an ill-informed population.
On Monday, the Italian government approved an economic aid package for up to €25 billion (nearly $28 million USD), including aid for workers who risk losing their jobs and baby-sitting vouchers for parents, in a bid to help struggling Italian businesses and families cope with the prolonged national lockdown.
CoViD-19 first emerged last December in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to roughly 150 countries and territories, causing the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the outbreak a pandemic.
World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesu told reporters:
“More than 132,000 cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to the WHO from 123 countries and territories; 5,000 people have lost their lives – a tragic milestone.
Europe has now become the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China. More cases are now being reported every day than were reported in China at the height of its epidemic.
… Our message to countries continues to be: you must take a comprehensive approach.
Any country that looks at the experience of other countries with large epidemics and thinks ‘that won’t happen to us’ is making a deadly mistake. It can happen to anyone.”

Big Tech in Talks With the US Government to Use Your Location Data to Fight COVID-19,"



Facebook

Reddit

(TMU) — The U.S. government wants to work with big social tech giants like Google, Facebook, and others, to track the spread of CoViD-19.
The goal would be to aggregate citizen’s location data to help track the spread of CoViD-19 and presumably make sure that people are social distancing and quarantining when appropriate. The proposed partnership, described by the Washington Post, would also aim to map out how CoViD-19 is being transmitted and whether or not current quarantine methods are working.
The companies would use location data from apps and smartphones themselves to accomplish this goal.
According to the report which cited unnamed anonymous White House officials, they would use aggregated, anonymized data provided by tech companies to determine the probability of transmission of the coronavirus between different regions in the U.S.
“We’re encouraged by American technology companies looking to leverage aggregated, anonymized data to glean key insights for CoViD-19 modeling efforts,” an official with the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy told the Washington Post.
The insights could potentially “help public health officials, researchers, and scientists improve their understanding of the spread of CoViD-19 and transmission of the disease,” the officials said.
Still, the the project is raising red flags for those concerned with privacy.
The plan comes after multiple meetings between White House officials and the big tech industry, according to Business Insider. The proposed project isn’t yet in operation but that could change in the near future.
Earlier this week, Israel’s government approved a new emergency regulation that would allow it to monitor, spy, and track cellphone location data of known coronavirus patients without court approval. The underlying goal of this approach is to warn individuals who happen to cross paths with a coronavirus carrier that they too could also be infected with the novel virus.
The use of personal data has implications beyond just the virus and could be troubling for people who value the future of privacy. It should be noted that any police state actions are prone to continue long after this pandemic has subsided. Giving up freedoms and liberties now will likely have an everlasting effect felt for generations to come.

Italian Actor Begs For Help After Authorities “Refuse” to Collect Sister’s Dead Body From Home,"

(TMU) — The brother of a woman who died in their home of coronavirus was forced to resort to issuing desperate a plea on social media in a bid to convince Italian authorities to come collect her body.
Actor and mixed martial arts trainer Luca Franzese was confined to his Naples home with the decaying corpse of his sister Teresa Franzese, 47, who died of the illness on Saturday.
Their elderly parents and other relatives, including young children, were also in the home.
Her health rapidly degraded shortly after she began to show symptoms of the novel virus. Al Jazeera reports that she was known to suffer from a form of epilepsy but was otherwise quite healthy.
In a heartbreaking video posted on Facebook, her grief-stricken brother issued an emotional appeal. Franzese said:
“I am waiting for the institutions to give me answers since last night. Nobody came forward,” the grief-stricken man said Sunday in the emotional video posted on Facebook.
I am making this video for the good of Italy, for the good of Naples. My sister died last night, probably because of the virus, and I’ve been waiting for answers since last night.
” had to force them to come and do the test. I’ve had to put myself in self-isolation. I might have the virus. To keep my sister alive, I tried to give her mouth to mouth resuscitation and no one cared, no one is calling me. 
We are ruined, Italy has abandoned us.
But we must give each other strength.”   


Positiva al coronavirus
Posted by Luca Franzese on Sunday, March 8, 2020
Due to the mass anxiety and uncertainty regarding the virus, undertakers and medical personnel refused to collect her body.
Once the video went viral, a local politician intervened to find a funeral home willing to help the family’s plight.
Pasqual Pernice of the Aprea Funeral Home explained:
“It was surreal … We used masks, sterile shoes, hazmat suits, glasses and gloves. Luca and another relative were there, but other family members were all in another room.”
Teresa Franzese was buried without any family members present.
Pernice added:
“If it gets worse, and we have to do it again, we will. It’s our job.”
Francesco Emilio Borelli, a local health official and councilor, said:
“It was the first case in Italy in which a person with the virus dies at home, so there was some confusion on what to do. 
The family [exemplifies] altruism, they are doing everything they can to protect their community, and the community is staying close to them by bringing food.
Now the big problem is that they have been closed in there for four days, and no one is taking away their trash. It’s getting unhygienic and we don’t know what to do about it. Someone needs to help them.” 
Italy has so far been the most impacted country by the virus after China. The BBC reports that as of Friday, the coronavirus has claimed 1,016 lives amid a total number of 15,113 infections.
Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio told the British outlet:
“Italy was the first nation in Europe to be affected so badly … But I hope it also means that Italy is the first one to leave the emergency behind.
Our grandfathers were drafted to go to war; we’re being asked to stay at home.
If a doctor and a nurse can work for 24 hours non-stop, we can give up leaving our own home. The huge majority of citizens are respecting the rules. Those who aren’t will face sanctions: either fines or criminal charges.”

"Japan to Punish Those Profiteering On Face Masks With Year in Prison, 1 Million Yen Fine, Or Both","

Email



(TMU) — The Japanese government is taking aim at those seeking to profit from the growing coronavirus pandemic by making the reselling of masks a crime punishable by a one-year prison term or ¥1 million ($9,800) fine, or both, Tokyo announced Tuesday.
The new rule is set to come into effect on Sunday and aims to prevent unethical would-be profiteers from using the scarcity of masks to their advantage for monetary gain, reports Japan Times.
However, a trade ministry official stressed that the rule does not seek to bar people from redistributing masks to friends and family or reselling them for the same price they were purchased for, or for lower prices.
The official said that the government simply seeks to “ensure that the average consumer can get their hands on masks.”
The rule is being implemented through a revised version of a law enacted to control panic-buying and price-gouging during 1973 oil crisis, when the world economy was upended after members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries launched an oil embargo.
At present, other in-demand products including diapers and disinfectants are not being included in the new rule, but they may be added later if Tokyo deems the move necessary. The rule will be lifted following a return to normal demand.
The move also comes after the trade ministry asked e-commerce and online retail firms such as Rakuten and Mercari to suspend online auctions of face masks on March 14, but resellers have still persisted in seeking to flip the highly sought-after masks.
Manufacturers have struggled to meet the surging demand for masks, even as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promised that the country would boost the supply of face masks to 600 million a month, with a priority on stocking nursing facilities.
Shizuoka prefectural assemblyman Hiroyuki Morota recently issued a televised apology after he was revealed to have made ¥8.9 million ($85,000) by selling packets of 2,000 face masks online in auctions for ¥30,000 to ¥170,000 each. The independent lawmaker, who runs a trading company, claims that he had surplus stock of the masks following the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome that first appeared in 2012.
Because Morota operates a trading company, he may not be classified as a reseller and could possibly be exempt under the new rule, the trade ministry official said.
Also Tuesday, Prime Minister Abe extended a request for large sports and cultural events to be canceled or postponed due to viral spread of the outbreak. The Japanese Cabinet also approved a bill that would allow the prime minister to declare a state of emergency if necessary as the East Asian country struggles to control coronavirus infections ahead of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, Kyodo News reports.

Wisconsin Police Warn That Local Meth May Contain ‘Corona Virus’—Offer to Test It for Free,"

(TMU) — A local Midwestern law enforcement agency is hoping to take advantage of the hysteria surrounding the novel coronavirus outbreak to net a few gullible criminals.
The Merrill Police Department in Wisconsin made a strange announcement Wednesday appealing to local residents possessing methamphetamines to come down to the police station where they could subject it to free tests to make sure that it’s not contaminated with “the Corona Virus [sic].”
According to the clever cops, locally-purchased meth could be contaminated with the virus, the department explained in a Facebook post.
The department then explained that anyone can come into a local station to test it—“no appointment necessary.”
The agency asked its Facebook followers to spread the word, adding:
“If we can help only one person, it’s worth it!”
The post has since gone viral, gaining over 5,500 shares as of Thursday afternoon.
While the idea that any drug users would come to the police station to “test” their illicit substances may sound far-fetched, the Merrill Police Department noted in a later update that the naiveté of many law-breakers has reached stupefying levels in the past.

P.S.AWARNING: If you have recently purchased Meth, it may be contaminated with the Corona Virus. Please take it to the …
Posted by Merrill Police Department on Wednesday, February 26, 2020
The agency explained:
“Just to give you some history, we have actually experienced people report their illegal drugs being stolen, being ripped off in a drug deal, being sold a look-a-like illegal substance, etc. We have even experienced drunk drivers coming to pick up arrested drunk drivers as their ‘sober responsible party.’
So this attempt, although a long shot, still had some possibility behind it. We will take those easy grabs at removing poison from our community whenever we can.”
In 2016, a woman in Toulouse, France, walked into her local police station with two bags of cocaine and one bag of crack cocaine to ask officers to test the quality of the drugs because “she didn’t want people to die of an overdose.” The woman, who had a history of drug offenses, was quickly placed under arrest.

Landlord Tells Restaurant Owners to Pay Their Employees Instead of Rent During Pandemic,"

(TT) — Service and retail workers around the world are missing out on income and some of them are losing their jobs as a result of the coronavirus shut down. Lawmakers have promised relief initiatives which include suspending rent and utility payments, as well as income supplementation. In the United States, such measures are still being discussed, and many workers are still wondering what their future will look like.
Workers in the US have the option of filing for unemployment, but that only provides a portion of their income and requires a lengthy application process. Many services and retail workers who live paycheck to paycheck are at risk of suffering serious financial hardships from being out of work for an extended period of time.
The government has suspended mortgage payments, which means that homeowners cant be evicted for missed payments during the lockdown, but this offers very little help to renters, many of whom have been told by their landlords that they are still expected to pay their rent.
However, a landlord in Jonesboro, Arkansas, made a post on social media earlier this week saying that his company would not expect its restaurants to pay rent during the shut down, and instead suggested that they continue to pay their employees instead.

Property owner Clay Young said that all small businesses are suffering right now and he did not want to put more pressure on them during this difficult time.
“It was just the right thing to do,” he said.
Paula Lowe, co-owner and executive chef at Roots said that these are uncertain and unprecedented times.
“This is a crisis that the restaurant industry has never faced before. There’s nothing that we can change. Every day is day-by-day,” Lowe said.
“I’ve been in this industry for 27 years and I’ve never seen anything like this,” Lowe added.

(TMU) — Over the past two months, people all over the world have been on lockdown due to the CoViD-19 pandemic. In Wuhan, China, the initial epicenter of the outbreak, residents of the city began singing and cheering from their windows and balconies as a way of comforting one another.
Videos from January that captured these moments were shared widely across the internet and people in other countries decided to continue this tradition as the quarantine reached their neighborhoods.
Now in Columbus, Ohio, where officials estimate that there could be as many as 100,000 undiagnosed cases of the virus, a video has emerged of two children who held a concert on the front porch of their elderly neighbor, who was self-isolating to protect herself from the virus.
9-year-old When Taran Tien and his 6-year-old sister, Calliope, heard that their neighbor Helena Schlam was stuck inside of her house and wanted to find some way to help her. Schlam said that she did not need any groceries so the two children dressed up and played their cellos on their neighbor’s front porch. The video was later shared on Twitter by the journalist Jackie Borchardt, who says she lives in the neighborhood.

Rebecca Tien, the children’s mother, told CNN that she hopes this was able to bring the community together during a difficult time.
“I loved watching how delighted they all were. It was one of those moments where you feel like you’re a part of something incredible. It was also a good way to remember the value of connection, especially at a time like this when everyone feels disconnected. Just to know we were a part of something so sweet, even just for a minute, meant a lot,” Tien said.
In one of the first viral quarantine videos that we have seen from a rural community, the children played classical tunes for 30 minutes.
Schlam, who kept a safe distance from the children at all times, told the Columbus Dispatch:
“It was so delightful. It was a little cold, but I just put on an extra coat. The kids are really quite talented, and it was so much fun.”
Meanwhile in Italy, a dance music DJ took out his mixer and some speakers and gave a performance for his community from the balcony.

(ZH) — The US will begin screening airline passengers beginning Friday after a SARS-like pneumonia outbreak in central China has claimed a second life after a 69-year-old man died on Wednesday, according to the Straits Times.
“To further protect the health of the American public during the emergence of this novel coronavirus, CDC is beginning entry screening at three ports of entry,” said CDC official Martin Cetron, adding “We’re expecting that the screening over the next couple of weeks could include as many as 5000 people” starting Friday night.
The three airports are; San Francisco International, New York’s JFK, and Los Angeles International.
The second death from the new coronavirus occurred at the Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital in the Hubei province. He had been ill approximately two weeks before experiencing multi-organ system failure, according to Bloomberg, citing a Thursday statement by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.
As of Friday, the city has reported 45 cases of the coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV. According to the report, five patients are in critical condition, twelve have been cured and discharged, and two have died.
Authorities in Japan reported a case Thursday in a resident of Kanagawa prefecture aged in his 30s, who had spent time with an infected person in Wuhan. That’s the second time someone outside China was found to be infected with the novel coronavirus, which has captured international attention because of similarities with the one that sparked Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, 17 years ago.
Unlike SARS, which killed almost 800 people, the new virus doesn’t appear to spread easily between people. Much remains to be understood about the new coronavirus, which was first identified in China earlier this month, the World Health Organization said in a statement Thursday in response to the case in Japan. –Bloomberg
It is unknown how the virus is spread, however it is believed to be concentrated among a Wuhan fish market which carries other meat as well.
“I’ve been here since 1996, and that’s the only other time we’ve ever done this — for Ebola,” Cetron said.

Harvard Epidemiologist Says Coronavirus Outbreak is Bad—”Thermonuclear Pandemic Level Bad”,"

(TMU) — Harvard public health scientist Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding is describing the current coronavirus outbreak as bad—”thermonuclear pandemic level bad.”
The virus, now known as 2019-nCoV, has killed 82 people, infected almost 3,000 more, and spread to multiple other countries—and Dr. Feigl-Ding has been tweeting about it non-stop since last week. It is the third time since 2003 that a coronavirus has made the jump from animals to humans.
Feigl-Ding, who holds a dual doctorate in epidemiology and nutrition, began by expressing that he is “deeply worried” about the outbreak and indicated that it may be “silently contagious“—a fact that has now been confirmed by China’s National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei.
I’ll be honest – as an epidemiologist, I’m really deeply worried about this new coronavirus outbreak. 1) the virus has an upward infection trajectory curve much steeper than SARS. 2) it can be transmitted person to person before symptoms appear — I.e. it is silently contagious! pic.twitter.com/5Kjo6DkbQj
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 23, 2020

On Friday, Dr. Feigl-Ding prefaced his calculations that the reproductive value (R0) of the virus is 3.8 by saying “HOLY MOTHER OF GOD.” Others have estimated that the R0 is 3.3 and 2.6 while the World Health Organization (WHO) has put the R0 somewhere between 1.4 and 2.5
The R0 value, which represents the number of secondary cases which result from every new infection, is the key variable when determining how infectious a virus truly is.
Dr. Feigl-Ding went on to describe the outbreak as “thermonuclear pandemic level bad… I’m not exaggerating.”
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD – the new coronavirus is a 3.8!!! How bad is that reproductive R0 value? It is thermonuclear pandemic level bad – never seen an actual virality coefficient outside of Twitter in my entire career. I’m not exaggerating… #WuhanCoronovirus #CoronavirusOutbreak pic.twitter.com/6mmxIHL9Ue
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 25, 2020

A paper referenced by Dr. Feigl-Ding and uploaded to medRxiv estimates the R0 value “to be between 3.6 and 4.0, indicating that 72-75% of transmissions must be prevented by control measures for infections to stop increasing.” The non-peer reviewed article goes on to explain:
“Our model suggests that travel restrictions from and to Wuhan city are unlikely to be effective in halting transmission across China; with a 99 percent effective reduction in travel, the size of the epidemic outside of Wuhan may only be reduced by 24.9 percent.”
11/ REFERENCE for the R0 attack rate (reproductive coefficient) of 3.8 and the 99% containment models come from this paper: https://t.co/KrQfuAfS4l
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 25, 2020

Eric Toner, Senior Scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Senior Scientist in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, also expressed during an interview with CNBC that China’s efforts to contain the outbreak are “unlikely to be effective.”

Researchers in the U.K. have estimated that only 5.1 percent of cases in Wuhan have been identified.
3/ … We estimate that only 5.1% (95%CI, 4.8-5.5) of infections in Wuhan are identified, and by 21 January a total of 11,341 people (prediction interval, 9,217-14,245) had been infected in Wuhan since the start of the year. Should the epidemic continue unabated in Wuhan….
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 25, 2020

As rumors and misinformation about the virus, the outbreak, the true conditions in China, and even simulations that took place months prior, Dr. has come under harsh criticism for his tweets. However, the epidemiologist contends he is not “trying to incite fear.”
Some folks think I’m trying to incite fear. I’m not trying—I’m a scientist. This #coronavirus #WuhanCoronovirus is serious. Over 50 million people are quarantined + case counts will go up much more. Predict @WHO will declare emergency. Let’s hope for the best, prepared for worst. https://t.co/H3UcR9eAjs
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 25, 2020

It is important to remember that the above estimates are just that and are based on assumptions amidst a rapidly changing situation that could continue to change in various and even unknown ways without a moment’s notice. While it currently appears that 2019-nCoV is far more infectious than previously known coronaviruses and may be on par with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed 20 to 50 million people around the world, it may switch gears at any time. However, the R0 value for the Spanish flu was a mere 1.8, so even if the estimates putting 2019-nCoV’s R0 value closer to 2.8 are more accurate, it’s “still super bad.”
14/ Let’s pretend the 3.8 estimate is too high (there’s unpublished estimates of 2.5). even if this virus’s R0=2.5, that’s still 2x higher than seasonal flu’s 1.28 (ref above), and higher than 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic of 1.80 that killed millions. So 2.8 is still super bad folks
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 25, 2020

On Monday, Feigl-Ding touched on and attempted to clarify the conflicting R0 estimates:
5) CONFLICTING R0 NUMBERS: Lots of conflicting reports of Wuhan #coronarovirus R0 (reproductive number) — not all the R0 estimates are the same! The @MRC_Outbreak’s R0=2.6 is the most reliable since they used WHO data as @WHO research center. Most other used generic online data.
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 27, 2020

In Dr. Feigl-Ding’s latest tweets he calls on the WHO to “finally” declare an emergency.
8) Overwhelming #coronavirus data suggests: A- High R0 between 2.6-2.9 (best sources). B- Has “higher pandemic risk than SARS”. C- Contagious even w/out symptoms (unlike SARS). D- Cases increasing rapidly overseas. E- Countries need time to prepare. @WHO needs to declare🚨 now!
— Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) January 27, 2020

UPDATE 4:55pm EST — On Monday, the WHO “admitted an error” in assessing the risk of the coronavirus. A Sunday night situation report listed the risk as “very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level,” according to the AFP. The WHO admits that the agency “incorrectly” listed the global risk as moderate in reports on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

Mexico Considers Closing Border to Stop Coronavirus-Infected Americans From Entering,"

(TMU) — In an interesting turn of events, Mexican health officials are considering the possibility of closing off the country’s northern border with the United States amid the growing coronavirus outbreak.
In the debate surrounding travel across the U.S.-Mexico border, the roles are usually reversed with U.S. officials threatening to shut down the border over immigration and security concerns despite the fact that more people are actually moving from the United States to Mexico than the other way around.
Mexican health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell voiced his concerns about the risk of the outbreak spreading from the United States at a press conference on Friday.
“Mexico wouldn’t bring the virus to the United States, rather the United States would bring it here. The possible flow of coronavirus would come from the north to the south. If it were technically necessary, we would consider mechanisms of restriction or stronger surveillance,” Lopez-Gatell said.
The official number of cases in the U.S. is just over 2,300, but some experts and health officials believe that there are already hundreds of thousands of cases. Dr. Marty Makary, a medical professor at Johns Hopkins University, estimates that there could be up to a half-million cases in the U.S.
“Don’t believe the numbers when you see, even on our Johns Hopkins website, that 1,600 Americans have the virus. No, that means 1,600 got the test, tested positive. There are probably 25 to 50 people who have the virus for every one person who is confirmed,” Makary said.
“I think we have between 50,000 and half a million cases right now walking around in the United States,” he added.
Meanwhile, Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton estimated that there were at least 100,000 undiagnosed cases just in the state of Ohio.
“We know now, just the fact of community spread, says that at least 1 percent, at the very least, 1 percent of our population is carrying this virus in Ohio today. We have 11.7 million people. So the math is over 100,000. So that just gives you a sense of how this virus spreads and is spreading quickly,” Acton said.
There are still under 20 confirmed cases in Mexico, and no known deaths from the illness, although as with the U.S. and everywhere else, this number is likely to be higher due to inadequate testing.

(TMU) — As the gravity and scale of the CoViD-19 pandemic sinks in, people across the world are being advised to self-isolate while governments close borders and emergency laws are put in place to limit travel and the number of people allowed to gather. Across the world, sporting events have been cancelled and restaurants, clubs, theaters, and other facilities are closing their doors to the public in an effort to limit the spread of the virus.
Chicago’s Shedd Aquarium is no exception. With around 2 million visitors to the aquarium each year, the facility has closed its doors to the public for two weeks to help protect the community.
A notice on their website reads: “In the best interest of overall wellness for our community and for each other, Shedd Aquarium is temporarily closed to the public for two weeks through Sunday, March 29. During this period, all scheduled events and programs will be cancelled but may be rescheduled to a later date.”

Wellington Meets the Sea Otters
Wellington meets the sea otters! 🦦🐧 Wellington the rockhopper continued his field trip around the aquarium by visiting the sea otter habitat. At 32 years old, Wellington is no spring chicken (and not just because he’s a penguin!) He is more than double the life expectancy of a rockhopper! Thanks to laser therapy and cataract surgeries, he’s “still got it” and can enjoy going on enriching adventures. Where's Wellington going next? Stay tuned to find out!
Posted by Shedd Aquarium on Wednesday, March 18, 2020
Although the facility is now closed to human visitors, the aquarium, for the first time ever, had local penguin residents enjoy a walkabout that saw them exploring the facility. The event was captured on film, much to the delight of isolated humans.
The Shedd Aquarium, like many places that have been closed to visitors, is making an effort to engage with fans through various social media platform and the penguin tour was a definite hit!
Fans just loved the delightful penguins strutting their stuff around the Amazon Rising exhibit while they went about meeting fish and other animals. With over 100k likes on Twitter, the aquarium promised more video updates.

Wellington’s visit to Amazon Rising
Penguins in the Amazon?! 🐧🌴Some of the penguins went on a field trip to meet other animals at Shedd. Wellington seemed most interested in the fishes in Amazon Rising! The black-barred silver dollars also seemed interested in their unusual visitor.
Posted by Shedd Aquarium on Sunday, March 15, 2020
“While this may be a strange time for us, these days feel normal for animals at Shedd. Our caregivers are constantly providing new experiences for the animals to explore and express their natural behaviors with,” the aquarium wrote.
Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced last Friday that all public gatherings of 1,000 people or more were to be banned. For this reason, many venues and facilities had to close their doors.

(TMU) — As CoViD-19 continues to spread across the globe, it has become clear that even the rich and famous aren’t free of getting infected.
On Monday, this was once again made clear when actor Idris Elba announced on Twitter that he had tested positive for coronavirus and was in self-isolation, joining Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson, and others who are self-quarantining.
The multitalented 47-year-old British actor and musician, known for his roles in Luther, The Wire, and the Avengers series, noted that while he doesn’t have any symptoms he already went into isolation due to his realistic grip on the need for abundant caution—not only for his own sake but for the community’s.
In post shared to Twitter, Elba wrote:
“This morning I tested positive for Covid 19. I feel ok, I have no symptoms so far but have been isolated since I found out about my possible exposure to the virus. Stay home people and be pragmatic. I will keep you updated on how I’m doing. No panic.”

— Idris Elba (@idriselba) March 16, 2020

Speaking to the camera while his wife Sabrina stood alongside him, he said:
“Hey what’s up guys, so look, this morning I got some test results back for coronavirus and it came back positive.
Yeah and it sucks. Listen, I’m doing okay. Sabrina hasn’t been tested and she’s doing okay.
I didn’t have any symptoms. I got tested because I realized I was exposed to someone who had also tested positive.
I found out last Friday they were tested positive, I quarantined myself and got tested immediately and got the results back today.”
Continuing, he stressed the need to approach the viral outbreak with discipline and conscientiousness:
“Now’s the time to really think about social distancing, washing your hands … There are people out there who aren’t showing symptoms and that can easily spread it.
Transparency is probably the best thing for this right now.”
Elba also voiced his support for all of those suffering from the virus, which has infected over 180,000 people worldwide and claimed the lives of at least 7,081 people so far.
Extending his condolences to those who are grieving either due to the death of loved ones or economic misfortune, Elba added:
“We live in a divided world right now, we can all feel it …But now’s the time for solidarity. Now’s the time for thinking about each other.”

Chinese Doctor Who Was Silenced for Warning About Coronavirus Has Died From the Virus,"



Facebook

UPDATE — TMU initially reported that Chinese doctor Li Wenliang, who blew the whistle on the novel coronavirus back in December and was later arrested by authorities in China, had died as a result of contracting the virus after Chinese state media reported his death, causing an uproar on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Corporate media quickly picked up the story and ran with it, clearly communicating that Li was a victim of 2019-nCoV.
However, Wuhan Central Hospital quickly denied reports of Li’s death, claiming he was still alive but in critical condition. It has now been revealed that the hospital and Chinese state media walked back on the initial report and ordered the deceased doctor be put back on life support in an attempt to control the narrative, after seeing the reaction on Weibo. U.S. corporate media immediately took note and changed their headlines and reports to fall in line with what Chinese state media was reporting. Almost instantly TMU was inundated with comments on our social media platforms labeling this article as fake news.
It appears that not long after, Chinese officials became aware that their efforts to control the narrative failed and again walked back on their reports. After confirming his death, yet again, corporate media changed their headlines and their reports yet again.
BBC’s Ross Atkins explained what happened:
The story of how China announced the death of Dr Li Wenliang & then allegedly told doctors to put his body on life support & say he was ‘critical’. A grotesque end to the story of a brave man who tried to warn about the coronavirus & has now died from it. Produced @brysonandy pic.twitter.com/yy4hngupl0

This series of events is an excellent example of what independent media outlets like the Mind Unleashed deal with on a daily basis, albeit on a larger and more urgent scale. Fact checkers on social media platforms like Facebook are scanning our content daily looking for details they can flag as false, thus forcing us to jump through hoops to remove these strikes that inhibit our readers from seeing our content in their feeds. But today’s reporting on Dr. Li Wenliang showed us that news consumers are now acting as fact checkers themselves. The fake news scare has been so successful that readers are buying into the “if you see something, say something” marketing ploy resulting in comments and reports at the behest of the establishment narrative.
What this experience also showed was that U.S. corporate media is more than willing to report whatever China’s government and state media reports as fact despite a wealth of evidence that China’s government censors and issues false information in order to keep a tight grip on their preferred narrative. In the midst of a deadly pandemic is not the time to blindly trust reports from a not typically trustworthy source. In the midst of a deadly pandemic is the time to use resources and people power to investigate and search for hard proof. Unfortunately independent media does not have the same resources as corporate media giants but we do have a strong enough set of morals to not simply parrot the establishment narrative and flip flop our headlines simply because another country’s state media does.

(TMU) — Despite early praise from the World Health Organization (WHO) for China on their response to the recent novel coronavirus outbreak, the Chinese government is facing increasing backlash for its treatment of whistleblowers and journalists sharing news about the illness.
For public health situations such as this, the Chinese government has a strict bureaucracy in place to ensure that any information or direction comes directly from the authorities, which means that anyone sharing information different from official statements is considered a risk to national “harmony” or “security.”
Li Wenliang, a 34-year-old doctor working in Wuhan, was among the first of these whistleblowers who attempted to get the word out about the virus before it spread throughout the country. Today, global media reports have indicated that Li is the most recent victim of the virus, having just passed away after contracting 2019-nCoV.
The doctor first learned about the virus in late December when seven patients came through his hospital with a “SARS-like illness” and were subsequently quarantined.
The doctor sent out a post in his medical school alumni group on the Chinese messaging app WeChat about the situation, telling his friends to be careful. Screenshots of the post quickly went viral across WeChat before reaching global social media.
On January 3rd, Li and a few other medics at the hospital were arrested by the Wuhan police for rumor-mongering.
After an intense interrogation, Police allowed Li to return to home and to work after signing a statement promising not to commit further “unlawful acts.”

This doctor tried to save lives, but was silenced. Now he has coronavirus
This Wuhan doctor was targeted by police for trying to blow the whistle on the deadly coronavirus in the early weeks of the outbreak.Then, after treating a patient who had the virus, he caught it too.https://cnn.it/2u9heUZ
Posted by CNN on Tuesday, February 4, 2020
By January 12, just over a week after he was interrogated, Li was hospitalized and was suspected of having the virus. However, he did not test positive for the virus until February 1, after being hospitalized for nearly an entire month. Less than a week later, on February 6, he was reported to have died.
Li’s death is as tragic as it is concerning given that he was a young and healthy adult—not the typical immunocompromised cases we expect to see from something that people have been comparing to the flu—and was battling the virus on the frontlines.
One of the few U.S. citizens being vocal about their experience in quarantined Wuhan, being evacuated from China, and their resulting quarantine in the U.S. has expressed her suspicions about the situation on Twitter.

The official number of confirmed cases is around 28,275 at time of publishing, with a vast majority of those cases being confirmed in China. A total of 565 deaths have been reported with all but two having occurred in China.
Just moments ago, Wuhan Central Hospital denied reports of Li Wenliang’s death and claimed he was still alive but in critical condition.

(TMU) — Stocks plummeted on Monday as worries about the COVID-19 outbreak and an oil price war weighed on global financial markets. The Dow opened 1,800 points—or 7 percent—lower, the S&P 500 dropped 6.9 percent, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 7.1 percent. The New York Stock Exchange then halted stock trading for 15 minutes after tripping a circuit breaker.
The Atlantic revealed on Friday that only 1,895 people in the United States had been tested for CoViD-19 thus far based on interviews and surveys of local data from across the country.
At least 21 people in the U.S. have died but lack of testing and conflicting reports of recent deaths are causing many people to question those numbers.

TMU is continuing to stay on top of the latest coronavirus headlines and developments, summarizing the most important points for you.
Two New Yorkers that attended the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s (AIPAC) annual conference have tested positive for CoViD-19.

Meanwhile, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health announced 15 new presumptive positive CoViD-19 cases in the state, all of which had a direct connection to the Biogen employee conference in Boston late February.
The total number of CoViD-19 cases in Massachusetts is now 28.
As we suggested last week, the New York Times is now also reporting that CoViD-19 may have spread in the U.S. for weeks already. Two cases in Washington state detected weeks apart had genetic links, suggesting that many more people are likely infected.
On Friday, the NBA told teams to prepare for the possibility of playing games without fans in attendance in the event “it were to become necessary to play a game with only essential staff present” due to the effects of the novel coronavirus.
The entire state of New York declared a state of emergency has cases jumped 72 percent in only 24 hours. At the same time New York City has asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for more CoViD-19 test kits. One city official said, “Slow federal action on this matter has impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic,” according to the New York Times.
New York City Mayor Bill de Dlasio said on Sunday, “If you are a smoker or a vaper that does make you more vulnerable.” He told New Yorkers, “If you are a smoker or a vaper this is a very good time to stop that habit and we will help you.”
Oregon Governor Kate Brown declared a 60-day state of emergency during a Sunday press conference.

Community spread is suspected in Arizona after the third case was discovered. The newest case is a healthcare worker with no known confirmed contacts and no travel history to areas where CoViD-19 is present.
Community spread is likewise suspected in Chicago in what is the seventh confirmed case in the state of Illinois.
Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady said, “Though this may be the first case of community transmission in Chicago, it does not mean that widespread transmission of COVID-19 is happening here.”
Total U.S. cases have increased in multiple U.S. cities states over the last few days including Georgia (5 cases), Massachusetts (13 cases), San Francisco (8 cases), California (114 cases), and Iowa (3 cases).
Dr. Grant Colfax, director of health, said of San Francisco’s new cases:
 “These newly confirmed cases are an indication of the increasing circulation of coronavirus in the community, as expected, given the patterns in our state, region and our own city.”
Iowa Department of Health (IDPH) Medical Director and State Epidemiologist, Dr. Caitlin Pedati said:
“All three individuals were part of a cruise in Egypt. IDPH is working with local public health to assess potential exposures to others. These cases are an important reminder that all Iowans need to help prevent the spread of illness by washing hands frequently, staying home when ill, and covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue.”
On Sunday, health officials in Contra Costa County, California announced five new cases, four of which “did not travel or have known contact with a coronavirus case.”
In North Carolina, a hazmat decontamination tent has been put up at a hospital in Port Charlotte amid the outbreak. A supervisor at the hospital refused to confirm or deny if there is a CoViD-19 patient at the facility.
NASA staff has been ordered home “until further notice” at one of its biggest facilities after an employee tested positive for CoViD-19. The space agency’s Ames Research Center went lockdown and staff have been informed that it has gone into “MANDATORY telework status effective immediately and until further notice.”
A new report suggests that the US Congress could be suspended overs fears that CoViD-19 could move in on Capitol Hill. “Members are very nervous,” a senior Democratic leadership aide told NBC. ”There’s a lot of concern that members could bring it home.”
Canada continues to confirm more cases while Colombia and Costa Rica both confirmed first confirmed cases of CoViD-19. Costa Rica’s confirmed case is that of a woman from the United States who is visiting the country with her husband.
In a rare bit of good news, the largest study to date coming out of Wuhan has revealed that children aged 0-10 years have 67 percent lower odds of a severe infection than adults aged 20-40. And women appear to have 11 percent lower odds of severe infection than men.
CHILDREN’ RISK vs ADULTS: Children 0-10 years old have 67% lower odds of severe infection compared to Adults (age 20-40), Odds Ratio=0.33 (95%CI: 0.14-0.82) according to the largest study to date in Wuhan of 25,961 lab 🧪 positive #COVID19 cases.

Doctors have warned medics to “get ready” in a letter that states up to 10 percent of those infected need intensive care, resulting in overwhelmed hospitals. As of Saturday, 5,883 patients in Italy were confirmed to be infected while 233 people had died.
The Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care said in a document titled Recommendations of clinical ethics for admission to intensive treatments and for their suspension, in exceptional conditions of imbalance between needs and available resources:
“It may be necessary to place an age limit on entry into intensive care. It is not a question of making merely valuable choices, but of reserving resources that could be very scarce for those in the community primis more probability of survival and secondly to those who can have more years of life saved, with a view to maximizing the benefits for the greatest number of people.“
The World Health Organization (WHO) continues to urge countries to follow China’s drastic containment measures.
“Allowing uncontrolled spread should not be a choice of any government, as it will harm not only the citizens of that country but affect other countries as well.“
A grim analysis suggests that all hospital beds in the United States will be filled by May 8 in what is expected to be a complete overwhelming of the U.S healthcare system. 
Officials in Iran are expecting CoViD-19 to infect 40 percent of the capital city’s population in the next two weeks while yet another Iranian official has fallen ill and died due to the virus.
National Nurses United (NNU) recently released survey results indicating the U.S. is “wildly unprepared” for the coronavirus. Only 44 percent of those polled (out of 6,500) reported having been provided information on “how to recognize and respond to possible cases” of the coronavirus by their employer. 
An unnamed nurse explained: 
“As a nurse, I’m very concerned that not enough is being done to stop the spread of the coronavirus. I know because I am currently sick and in quarantine after caring for a patient who tested positive. I’m awaiting permission from the federal government to allow for my testing, even after my physician and county health professional ordered it.” 
TMU has been in contact with a nurse in Michigan who claims patients with clear signs of CoViD-19 are being refused testing and simply sent home. The nurse has since been alerted that they had been exposed to the virus, despite there being no confirmed cases in the state. The nurse is being denied a test as well.
A leaked presentation reveals that U.S. hospitals are preparing for millions of hospitalizations due to the outbreak. The February 26 presentation titled What healthcare leaders need to know: Preparing for the COVID-19 included representatives from National Ebola Training and Education Center and suggested there may be up to 96 million cases in the United States, 4.8 million hospitalizations, and 480,000 deaths.
On Thursday, a residential street in Rocklin, California was placed under quarantine after a resident with CoViD-19 died. “Law enforcement partners are currently responding to enforce a health officer’s order. We cannot share any additional information to protect patient confidentiality,” Katie Pritchard, Placer County Health Spokesperson, said.
According to WIBW:
“The orders were given under sections of California Health and Safety Code that allows Placer Health to ‘enforce regulations requiring strict isolation, or quarantine if the action is necessary for the protection of the public health.'”
Rocklin Police were unable to answer questions from TMU or provide an update. Instead they are referring all inquiries to Placer County.
Italy has announced a massive quarantine of the entire region of Lombardy until April 3. Also in Italy, one of the most powerful politicians in the country, Democratic Party leader Nicola Zingarelli, tested positive for the virus. The massive quarantine provoked panic and triggered stock markets to plunge 11 percent.  
Italians who attempt to flee the quarantine may face three months’ in prison, Italy’s interior minister has warned.
The Italian military airlifted a coronavirus patient between hospitals in Lombardy on Saturday, using a special bio-containment unit to reduce the risk of infecting other people.

 
In France, the government has banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people nationwide. “The priority is to do all we can to slow the transmission of the virus,” health minister Olivier Veran said.
The British government announced on Monday it had set up a team to tackle “interference and disinformation” around the COVID-19 outbreak. The counter-disinformation team will try to establish the impact of false information aimed at misleading people “either for the purposes of causing harm, or for political, personal or financial gain.” The team will then aim to identify and respond to the disinformation.
“Defending the country from misinformation and digital interference is a top priority,” Digital and Culture Minister Oliver Dowden said in a statement. “This work includes regular engagement with the social media companies, which are well placed to monitor interference and limit the spread of disinformation, and will make sure we are on the front foot to act if required.”
The Philippines declared a health emergency on Monday amid growing anxiety that CoViD-19 is already spreading undetected.
In Saudi Arabia, images security forces have quarantined the Qatif province and restricted traffic in it.

The office of Portugal’s 71-year-old president announced on Sunday that President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa has canceled all public activities and will self-quarantine at home amid the CoViD-19 outbreak. His office said that the president had no symptoms.
Japan is set to alter a law this week allowing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a state of emergency over the COVID-19 outbreak if needed. Critics of Abe have called out his initial lack of leadership.
And in China, a hotel being used to house people in quarantine collapsed in the city of Quanzhou. At least ten people were killed and others remain missing.
An infectious diseases expert at the forefront of the search for a coronavirus vaccine said on Friday that it was the most “frightening disease” he’s ever encountered, and that “war is an appropriate analogy” for what the U.S. is facing, as “50-70% of the global population” may become infected.
Dr. Richard Hatchett sat on the White House Homeland Security Council in 2005-2006 and was a principal author of the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan. He currently leads the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
Dr. Hatchett told the UK’s Channel 4:
“This is the most frightening disease I’ve ever encountered in my career, and that includes Ebola, it includes MERS, it includes SARS. And it’s frightening because of the combination of infectiousness and a lethality that appears to be manyfold higher than flu.”
He feels this way “because of the combination of infectiousness, and a lethality that appears to be many-fold higher than the flu.”

(TMU) — Hospitals in the United States are reporting massive shortages of masks and other protective equipment as coronavirus cases and deaths continue to rise by the day. To help with the shortage, Pornhub has donated 50,000 surgical masks to healthcare workers in New York City, which has become the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S.
According to the New York Post, the popular website has shipped 15,000 masks to paramedics in New York, 15,000 to firefighters in the city, and another 20,000 to Long Island’s Mount Sinai South Nassau hospital.
Mount Sinai South Nassau’s Senior Vice President Joe Calderone said that the masks will be a huge help to the hospital.
“These masks are mission critical in the fight against the COVID pandemic. They will help keep our nurses, physicians and support staff safe from infection while caring for those who are stricken with the disease,” Calderone said.
In Europe, the website is sending €50,000 ($54,050) to healthcare workers in Germany, Italy, and Spain so they can buy masks. They are also donating an additional $25,000 to the Sex Workers Outreach project, which is a pandemic-related relief fund for sex workers.
Pornhub is also offering its premium service for free to the entire world for the next 30 days as a way to encourage people to stay at home.
“With nearly one billion people in lockdown across the world because of the coronavirus pandemic, it’s important that we lend a hand and provide them with an enjoyable way to pass the time. We hope by expanding our offer of free Pornhub Premium worldwide, people have an extra incentive to stay home and flatten the curve,” Pornhub Vice President Corey said in a press statement.
Other companies in the U.S. like Tesla, Ford, and GM have also promised to make masks and ventilators as hospitals continue to run out. In some cases, healthcare workers in New York have resorted to wearing trash bags due to a lack of protective gear.

(CD) — President Donald Trump’s Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday suggested the deadly coronavirus that has sparked fears of a global pandemic could have a bright side, at least for the United States: more jobs.
“Every American’s heart has to go out to the victims of the coronavirus, so I don’t want to talk about a victory lap over a very unfortunate, very malignant disease,” Ross said in an interview with Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business. “But the fact is it does give businesses yet another thing to consider when they go through their review of their supply chain.”
“It’s another risk factor that people need to take into account,” added Ross. “I think it will help to accelerate the return of jobs to North America, some to [the] U.S., probably some to Mexico as well.”
“Ah, that’s a good point actually,” responded Bartiromo.

The coronavirus has killed at least 170 people in China and infected nearly 8,000 more as the Chinese government and other nations have worked to contain the outbreak with travel bans and restrictions.
Ross’ rosy assessment of potential U.S. economic gains from the virus was immediately denounced as grossly callous.
These people are so sick and heartless. And just imagine the uproar if a member of any other administration said this.

(CD) — As the federal government develops strategies for how to deal with the coronavirus outbreak that has already significantly damaged the U.S. economy and killed over 100 Americans, a group of lawmakers are urging Congress approve the purchasing of 19 more F-35 fighters than the Pentagon requested as part of the battle against the disease, enraging progressives.
“Infuriating doesn’t even begin to describe it,” tweeted Stephen Miles, executive director of Win Without War, on Friday.
Infuriating doesn't even begin to describe it. Can you think of a more outrageous thing for members of Congress to be demanding the federal gov't be spending its money on now than MORE F-35s, a jet that still doesn't work, than the Pentagon even wants. Do F-35s fight pandemics? pic.twitter.com/ox6uIHRmMG
— Stephen Miles (@SPMiles42) March 20, 2020

According to Politico, the request for more F-35s came from Democrats and Republicans alike:
“It is essential that we continue to increase production of our nation’s only 5th generation stealth fighter in order to ensure the United States maintains air dominance and to further reduce overall program costs,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to the chairmen and top Republicans of the House Armed Services Committee and Defense Appropriations panel.
The letter was spearheaded by the co-chairs of the Congressional Joint Strike Fighter Caucus — Reps. John Larson (D-Conn.), Marc Veasey (D-Texas), Martha Roby (R-Ala.) and Mike Turner (R-Ohio).
“Outrageous priorities of militarists during the coronavirus pandemic,” tweeted anti-war group Peace Pledge Union.
Win Without War has issued a list of policy demands—laid out in a document titled “U.S. Foreign Policy in the Face of the Coronavirus“—to help guide the government’s handling of the crisis.
The #coronavirus pandemic, & the economic crash it's sparked, have revealed deep weaknesses in the current economic & political order. We need a progressive internationalist response to this crisis, & that response must meet, at the least, 5 key demands:https://t.co/7nH2g6TU13

(TMU) — The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Defense (DOD) are preparing for a possible coronavirus pandemic response.
For the past six weeks, defense leaders have been meeting to plan for any possible scenario with the virus that first surfaced in China.
“We’ve issued a variety of [memoranda] and directives advising the force on how to deal with coronavirus,” Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper said in a DOD press release.
Esper emphasized that commanders at all levels have the authority and guidance they need to operate.
“(U.S. Northern Command) remains the global integrator for all DOD efforts and entities,” Esper said. “My number one priority remains to protect our forces and their families; second is to safeguard our mission capabilities and third [is] to support the interagency whole-of-government’s approach. We will continue to take all necessary precautions to ensure that our people are safe and able to continue their very important mission.”
Commanders are taking all necessary precautions because the virus is unique to every situation and every location. “We’re relying on them to make good judgments,” Esper said
Meanwhile, FEMA is also making preparations amid the possibility that President Donald Trump makes an emergency declaration to bring in extra funds and personnel to assist the administration’s coronavirus response, NBC reported.
According to NBC, documents show that the agency is actively planning to provide disaster relief funding to state and local governments, as well as federal assistance.
“To me this is another indication that the president and the White House are finally aware of the gravity of the situation,” said Michael Coen, who was FEMA chief of staff during the Obama administration. “They need to consider all tools available to them and have contingencies for action.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also recently upgraded the global death rate of the virus stating it is now 3.4 percent—an increase from the previous 2 percent.
“Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a press briefing at the agency’s headquarters in Geneva. In comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1 percent of those infected, he said.

(TMU) — The novel human coronavirus has reached all corners of the Earth. Some of us thought it wouldn’t and some of us knew it would. And while some people in the U.S. remain resolute that COVID-19 is no worse than influenza, others are preparing for a doomsday pandemic.
While rushing to the store to buy six months worth of supplies and hunkering down in your basement is likely overkill at this point, having a potential global pandemic on the horizon is as good time as any to consider your level emergency preparedness.
While the term emergency preparedness may evoke images of wacky “preppers” for some, you don’t have to go over the top to be prepared. In fact, being prepared should be the smart and normal course of action for American families who have the means to do so. Being prepared is not synonymous with hoarding.
According to YouGov, in 2018, prior to outbreak of the novel coronavirus which began in Wuhan, China, 75 percent of Americans were worried about the possibility of a natural disaster, a terror attack, or a host of other serious incidents that may affect the communities in which they live. However, despite their concern very few of them reported being prepared for any of these things.
In fact, 41 percent of respondents say they are not prepared for a natural disaster and only 39 percent say they have an emergency kit on hand. Only 39 percent of respondents reported having a stock of non-perishable food and only 28 percent said they have a supply of potable water.
Do you have an emergency kit or a supply of shelf stable food? What about water? If not, right now might not be the easiest time to build up your supplies as social media is clearly showing that pandemic panic has set in across the United States, but if you play your cards right you can still snatch up a few essentials that you should always have on hand in case of emergency.
I live in the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Washington State. My advice for those elsewhere – go to Costco now. Thousands of people at local stores yesterday – not where you want to be if there is a virus spreading. Glad I went a week ago.

Many of these people are likely buying above and beyond the necessary items (like the guy mentioned in the tweet below), but if you’re willing to brave the crowds and encounter some empty store shelves in the process we have some suggestions on what is most important to stock up on, whether or not there is a potentially deadly pandemic at your doorstep.

Epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters, power outages, and more have an ability to interrupt our normal daily lives. When these things last long or impact the greater world economy, as the novel coronavirus is, we have the potential to feel a significant impact, sometimes long after—picture the tsunami after an earthquake—even if the initial thing isn’t directly affecting you.
We should prepare ahead of time for any one of these things, but especially for this particular pandemic, so that we don’t add to the inevitable panic, so we don’t find ourselves in crowds of people were sickness can spread, and so we are at our best and calm and therefore able to assist others in our communities that may need assistance.
You’re preparing, that means the emergency or disaster isn’t here yet. So stay calm and think clearly. Grab a piece of paper and start building your emergency preparedness plan. What is your goal? Do you want to have enough food for one week or one month? How many people are in your family? In the event of a loss of power or gas will you have a way to cook food? Does anyone in your household take medications that cannot be skipped? The answers to these questions and more will help you navigate what is most important for your household and will help you build a list of exactly what you need.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security suggests keeping enough food and water for all members of your household on hand for a minimum of 72 hours but you may choose to extend that further by a week, two weeks, or more. Factors may depend on the size of your family, where you live, and the kind of emergency situations you may face.
Emergency meal kits can be purchased at stores like Costco, REI, and other online retailers that specialize in emergency preparedness. The kits come in varying sizes based on number of people and length of time. However, the purpose of these kids is to have them on hand before you need them. A lot of people have gained first hand experience with this recently when they found absolutely no meal kit results when searching Costco’s website. The kits can be nice because they take the guesswork out of building your emergency food supply and they are designed to not take up a lot of space but those who purchase them and don’t end up using them run into challenges when the things inside expire or when your family has dietary restrictions.
If you can’t currently get your hands on a food kit or don’t want to, here are some tips on what to collect individually. The exact amount will depend on the plan that you came up with.
Look for non-perishable and shelf stable items that your family is somewhat used to eating but that doesn’t need a lot of extra ingredients or materials to prepare. You should have a mix of things that need to be cooked and things that don’t. In some cases you may be short on water and fuel or not have access to it at all. If this is the case, an emergency supply of only food that requires cooking won’t get you too far. Pasta and sauce, canned and dried beans, canned vegetables, canned soups, oatmeal, shelf stable milks, along with snacks like granola bars, nuts, and dried fruits are a great place to start. And don’t forget about pet food if that applies to you.
Store your food in a cool, dry place and out of direct sunlight. Storage food in a hard-sided container is ideal especially if you’re keeping it in an attic or a basement. You don’t want pests to get to it before you do.
Check your kit every 6-months or so. During this time look for anything that might be damaged and pull it out. Look for expired foods or foods that will expire in the next six months. Use those items soon rather than throwing them away and make sure to replace anything you removed.
Reevaluate your kit every year. Has your household size changed? Is there a new dietary restriction or allergy you need to take into account?
It is recommended to store one gallon of water a day for each person in your household. This means a family of four with a 72-hour emergency kit should have 12 gallons of potable water in storage.
Bottled water flies off store shelves when communities are faced with illness, natural disaster, or impending inclement weather. However, unless you’ve been hiding under a rock you should be aware that most bottled water is no better than your tap water and some of it is actually worse because it is stored in thin plastic. When faced with an emergency some water is better than none, but consider the kind of water you’re storing and the source if you’re building a kit in advance of an emergency.
It’s great if you already filter your tap water but in the event that the water stops flowing, having filtration systems won’t do a darn thing to help you.
Water storage containers in varying sizes can be ordered online. Some, like WaterBricks, can be stacked for storage because water really can occupy a lot of space. Many of the containers out there are made of thick, blue plastic. Thick, colored plastic doesn’t let UV rays in and the blue color signals that there is water inside. In the filling process it is important to keep the area and your hands clean so that the water stays safe. Water won’t expire but some people like to swap it out every once in a while, though this isn’t necessary. If you’re storing your water in a basement, make sure it isn’t directly on a concrete floor.
Don’t forget to store water for your pets, too.
If someone in your household requires prescription medication find out how much you can secure ahead of time. Unfortunately this isn’t always easy when dealing with insurance companies in the United States and some medications don’t have a long shelf life anyway. When you have advance notice that something may impact your ability to get medications—like a big storm or a pandemic—contact your doctor and your pharmacy and find out if you can get approval to have some extra medication.
Keep a list of medications and pharmacies for those in your household in your emergency kit. Find out if there are over the counter items available to use in lieu of any of these medications in the event of an emergency and keep those items in your emergency kit. Skipping prescription medications and using something else is never ideal and is not something that should be taken lightly but in the event that it is literally impossible to get your medications, having some sort of back up, if available, is better than nothing.
Keep a first aid kit stocked. The essentials include a manual to help you tread wounds, pain reliever, bites, and other issues, tweezers, alcohol swabs, antibiotic ointment, bandages in multiples sizes, gauze pads and wrap, medical tape, elastic bandages, essential oils like lavender, colloidal silver cream and tincture, as well as instant cold packs. Add additional things specific to your household like children’s pain reliever and fever reducer, antacids, contact solution, etc.
If you’re going to be eating from your emergency food kit for days and potentially rationing water during this time, your nutrition might not be at its best. And if you’re facing a potential pandemic you’re going to want your immune system to be supported. Keep a stock of all vitamins and supplements that you normally take but consider increasing your intake of things like vitamin C, elderberry syrup, and colloidal silver, depending the kind of emergency you’re facing or preparing for.
Have extra batteries on hand and accessible for things like flashlights. And make sure you know where they are. When you need light the most is probably not when you’re going to want to be rummaging through your junk drawer. Keep flashlights in your kit but also in other places throughout your home. Back-up batteries for phones can come in handy during extended periods without electricity.
If you’re a camping enthusiast you probably have an alternative method for cooking food, like a small stove. If you need to use one remember to never do so inside your house. If you don’t already have something like this, small stoves are affordable and easily available from common brands like Coleman. Your emergency food won’t be of any use to you if it all must be cooked but your power is out, thus rendering your electric cooktop useless. Keep matches sealed in a waterproof container in your kit.
Generators come in handy but won’t be helpful if you don’t have fuel. However, as technology progresses we’re being given new options when it comes to alternative power sources. Small generators with different kinds of outlets can be charged from a wall outlet ahead of time or hooked up to a portable solar panel. Look for reliable brands like Goal Zero.
Keep your vehicle’s gas tank full when you have advanced notice that there may be an emergency situation on the horizon.
Toilet paper, paper towels, trash bags, bleach, hand sanitizers, vinegar, diapers, feminine hygiene products, along with paper plates, cups, and cutlery or a reusable mess kit (but keep in mind you may not be able to wash it).
The Department of Homeland security also recommends the following items:
Battery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert
Whistle to signal for help
Dust mask to help filter contaminated air and plastic sheeting and duct tape
Moist towelettes, garbage bags, and plastic ties
Wrench or pliers
Manual can opener
Local maps
Cell phone with chargers and a backup battery
Cash or traveler’s checks
Important household documents like insurance policies, identification and bank account records saved electronically or in a waterproof, portable container
Sleeping bag or warm blankets
Complete change of clothing and sturdy shoes
Fire extinguisher
Paper and pencil
Books, games, puzzles or other activities for children
Most importantly, remember not to panic. If you build up your supplies before an emergency strikes you’ll avoid the long lines and the inevitable panic. You won’t contribute to the empty shelves or the congestion at the stores and on the streets. If you’re facing an emergency as the result of a potential pandemic, staying home and out of the crowds is the best place to be and you will, because you’re prepared.
If you already are prepared, take a moment and pat yourself on the back—you’re in the minority. If you aren’t prepared, regardless of whether or not you’ve considered it in the past, don’t be discouraged. Sit down, plan your kit, and calmly get to work. It is never too early to prepare your household but it can be too late.

"5 Million Potential Coronavirus Carriers Have Already Left Wuhan, Mayor Reveals","

(ZH) — Wuhan’s mayor Zhou Xianwang revealed on Sunday during a press conference that about 5 million residents had already left the city before the lockdown because of the coronavirus outbreak and the Spring Festival holiday.
As the SCMP reports, many of Wuhan’s residents had already left the city for the holiday, while others rushed out after the lockdown was announced on Wednesday night.
As a result, only 9 million people were remaining in the city after the lockdown, with roughly a third of the population—including countless cases of coronavirus—having already spread across China.
Due to the Chinese Lunar New Year and the #WuhanCoronavirus, more than 5 million people left Wuhan and 9 million people remain in the city which is under lockdown: Wuhan mayor pic.twitter.com/hi2NwsHmou
— Global Times (@globaltimesnews) January 26, 2020
Meanwhile, Chinese health officials ­warned the virus’ ­ability to spread was ­getting ­stronger. Ma Xiaowei, the minister in charge of China’s National Health Commission (NHC), told a press conference that battling the outbreak had become especially complicated, after it was discovered that the new virus could be transmitted even during incubation period, which did not happen with Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome).
In other words, as many as tens if not hundreds of thousands of Coronavirus carriers quietly fled, and may have infected as many as 3-4 other people each, depending on the R0 of the virus.
“From observations, the virus is capable of transmission even during incubation period,” Ma said, adding that the incubation period lasted from one to 14 days. “Some patients have normal temperatures and there are many milder cases. There are hidden carriers,” he said.
As for the piece de resistance, Ma said also that the virus had adapted to humans and appeared to have become more transmissible:
“There are signs showing the virus is becoming more transmissible. These walking ‘contagious agents’ [hidden carriers] make controlling the outbreak a lot more difficult.“
Even China’s authorities sounds like they are giving up: Li Bin, deputy minister of the NHC said the authorities that the severe measures they had taken to control the spread of the virus – such as issuing travel bans and locking down cities – would at least delay the peak and “buy time to combat the next stage of the outbreak”, according to SCMP.
Yes, China is already bracing for “the next stage of the outbreak.”
To help tackle the epidemic, which has closed off 17 cities, Ma said that 2,360 military and civilian doctors and nurses had been sent to Wuhan, the city in which the outbreak was first detected at the end of last month. As the pressure has mounted on the city’s hospitals, the medical system has moved ever closer to collapse.
Many people who developed feverish symptoms were turned away by hospitals earlier in the week because there were not enough beds, local residents said earlier. Medical practitioners are also running seriously short of protective kits and are being forced to recycle goggles and masks. Ma said 2,400 hospital beds had been added in Wuhan, and the government was planning to add 5,000 more over the next three days.
Wang Jiangping, China’s vice-minister of industry and information technology, said China had the capacity to produce a maximum of 30,000 protective outfits per day, but that was less than a third of what was needed in Hubei.
Meanwhile, the hunt for the real source of the pandemic continues. China imposed a nationwide ban on wildlife trade on Sunday, as the outbreak was originally suspected to have originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, which also sold wild animals.
However, that appears to not be the source. A research paper published by medical journal The Lancet on Saturday said the first confirmed case of the viral infection was a person who had not been to that market.

UPDATE 1 (10:36am): As the news spread, Eduardo Bolsonaro accused the media of spreading “too much lies and little information.” The younger Bolsonaro did not outright deny the report, but said that the examinations were not yet completed.

(ZH) —  It’s official: Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has tested positive for coronavirus, making him the highest ranking political leader in the world to get Covid-19 thus far.
It was first reported Thursday that Bolsonaro was being monitored and tested, after his press secretary Fabio Wajngarten had tested positive for the virus.
Crucially Bolsonaro along with his aide met with Donald Trump when the Brazilian delegation traveled to Mar-a-Lago on 7 March, with Bolsonaro reportedly having more contact with Trump than this aide, including a Saturday evening dinner at the resort.
Local Brazilian media reports Bolsonaro will undergo a second COVID-19 test to confirm the first.
On Thursday some unconfirmed local reports began saying Bolsonaro had tested positive, but other sources denied what appeared premature speculation.
Journalist Glenn Greenwald writes of Friday’s breaking Brazilian newspaper reports: “A reasonably reliable Brazilian newspaper is reporting, based on sources with first-hand knowledge inside the presidential palace, that Bolsonaro’s first test was positive for COVID-19.” He added that “A second more reliable test was performed; results available today.”

The Brazilian president’s office has yet to comment on or confirm the new reporting early Friday.
Major Brazilian newspaper O Dia broke the story Friday, with the paper saying his preliminary results came back Friday, according to sources within the Brazilian government.
Likely this means the US president himself will now be closely monitored and tested, if not already.

Millions of 15-Minute Coronavirus Home Testing Kits Will Be Available to UK Public ‘Within Days’,"

(TMU) — New 15-minute home coronavirus tests will soon be available over the counter or via home delivery within days in the U.K., according to public health authorities, in a move that could see the country make vast strides toward tampering down fears and restoring some normalcy amid the ongoing pandemic.
The Guardian reports that millions of the test kits could be available as soon as next week, allowing people with symptoms who are self-isolating to find out if they have been infected through a simple device—similar to an OTC pregnancy test—that involves pricking a finger and analyzing a drop of blood for IGM, an antibody which appears in the early stages of infection.
The test will also detect IGG, which increases as the body responds to the novel virus and is indicative of whether someone has had CoViD-19 and thus has some degree of immunity.
The British government has already purchased 3.5 million of the tests and has plans to order millions more.
Prof. Sharon Peacock, director of the national infection service at Public Health England (PHE), told members of parliament on the science and technology committee that the government is waiting for the tests to be evaluated sometime this week before they are made available to the general public.

Peacock said:
“Several million tests have ben purchased for use. These are brand new products. We have to be clear they work as they are claiming to do.
Once they have been tested this week and the bulk of tests arrive, they will be distributed into the community.”
While the British government has been testing 5,000 to 6,000 people daily, authorities hope to ramp up daily tests to 25,000 within four weeks.
The new tests could help the U.K. live up to the World Health Organization (WHO) mantra of “test, test, test.” The U.N. agency sees testing as the crucial backbone of a comprehensive approach to defeating CoViD-19, which consists of testing, tracing, treating, and isolating the pandemic.

WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said:
“We cannot stop this pandemic if we do not know who is infected.”
European and Southeast Asian countries are also ordering the new antibody tests, Prof. Peacock said. She added:
 “We are not alone in doing this.”

(TMU) — We’ve seen a number of bizarre—if not previously unimaginable—things since this coronavirus pandemic plunged the entire world into chaos.
And as increasing numbers of people in various countries are being instructed to shelter-in-place, self-quarantine, or otherwise obey strict orders to remain indoors, people are getting creative in their approach to carry on their pre-crisis routines, errands, and necessary tasks.
And for one resourceful man in Cyprus, this meant deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle to walk his dog while on lockdown due to the novel virus.
In a video published to Facebook on Wednesday, Vakis Demetriou shared an extraordinary image of his small dog being taken for a walk by a drone that hovers at the opposite end of a leash.
The video caption read:
“5th day quarantine. Stay home safe but don’t forget your dog’s happiness.”

The pup itself seemed quite satisfied by the arrangement as he walked through the empty streets of Limassol, a city on the southeastern coast of the Mediterranean island nation.
According to In-Cyprus, the country’s health ministry has 75 confirmed cases of CoViD-19 as of Friday evening. There are also 33 confirmed cases in the Turkish-occupied zone in the north of the country.

Fish Are Visible In Venice Canals As Water Becomes Clearer Following Italy’s Lockdown,"

(TMU) — The continued outbreak of the coronavirus has been an enormously disruptive and tragic event, with massive humanitarian and economic repercussions for the entire world.
However, there have also been some surprising and not entirely unwelcome side effects.
Case in point: the canals of Venice, Italy, which are normally teeming with tourists all year round, with many flocking to the famous gondola boats that traverse the city’s iconic canals.
The Venetian canals are famously unclean. Filled with brackish water – a mixture of saltwater and fresh water – as well as a decidedly funky mixture of pollution, including human waste and boat chemicals, the canals typically appear clean only after the local government clears it of litter and other debris.
However, as Italy continues to be under a nationwide lockdown affecting some 60 million residents, locals in Venice are beginning to notice that the canals have become far clearer – so much so that people are being treated to the rare sight of little fish swimming through the now-transparent waters of the city’s 150 canals.
People have begun uploading images of the city’s canals to a Twitter account called Venezia Pulita (Clean Venice), expressing their sense of awe at the sudden return of wildlife to a city that has long struggled with pollution. Similar images have also been uploaded to Twitter.

In one post, user Marco Capovilla wrote:
“Incredible images of the Rio dei Ferali, behind San Marco square, usually murky. Nature takes back its spaces.”
In another post, user Marco Contessa posted images of swans “retaking” the Venetian canals.

Various commenters were awestruck by the images.
One user noted:
“Nature resumes it’s life….how beautiful.”
Another commented that they wished the water had always been so crystal-clear:
“Marvelous [that] there are even fish that we have the opportunity to see.”
While one commenter suggested that perhaps the pandemic has some scant silver lining:
“What a marvel this Venice was; this virus brought something….beautiful.”

However, looks can be deceiving. The Venice mayor’s office informed CNN that the water still remains just as dirty as ever.
A spokesman told the network:
“The water now looks clearer because there is less traffic on the canals, allowing the sediment to stay at the bottom.
“It’s because there is less boat traffic that usually brings sediment to the top of the water’s surface.”

However, it remains inarguable that the air quality in Italy has improved – as was graphically depicted in an animation compiled from satellite data and released by the European Space Agency (ESA).
In a press release, the ESA noted that the reduction has been particularly striking in northern Italy, which “coincides with its nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.”

Indeed, while it remains unimaginable during the present crisis to imagine that there may be some positive effects from the novel virus outbreak, it’s also clear that our effect on nature – or lack thereof – has been thrust into full view, showing that we could actually improve the environment if we had the will to do so.

Cannabis Shops Deemed “Essential” and Allowed to Stay Open Under LA’s Emergency Coronavirus Order,"

(TMU) — While millions of Californians are hunkering down following successive local emergency orders followed on Thursday evening by a statewide “stay at home” order from California Governor Newsom—the priorities faced by the state remain in the hearts and minds of residents and authorities.
As the coronavirus outbreak spreads across the Golden State, authorities in Los Angeles County and the cities within its borders are taking pains to ensure that essential services continue to operate uninterrupted—including cannabis dispensaries.
The Los Angeles Times reports that despite the order to shutter all indoor malls, shopping centers, playgrounds, and nonessential retail businesses, cannabis dispensaries must continue to operate alongside hardware stores, grocery stores, and city and county government services. Like other spaces, the dispensaries must observe social-distancing guidelines and not gather over 10 people.
For a state that spearheaded the drive to legalize marijuana—first as medicine, then as a recreational substance—the logic is simple. According to the City of Los Angeles’ coronavirus FAQ, essential healthcare services include “cannabis dispensaries, or any related and/or ancillary healthcare services.”
To answer a popular question: cannabis dispensaries with a medicinal cannabis license are considered essential and may remain open. https://t.co/9f8LQDXWCP
— Los Angeles County (@CountyofLA) March 20, 2020

On Thursday, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued the “Safer at Home” emergency order that commands all residents to stay inside their residences, limiting all movements outside of their homes unless they are engaged in certain essential activities. The order is legally enforceable, meaning that violation could bring criminal penalties including a fine or imprisonment.
But amid the siege-like conditions suffered by Californians, residents remain adamant about stocking up on not just hand sanitizers, toilet paper, and guns, but also their cannabis.
In an informal survey of cannabis dispensaries and delivery services, the Times found that dispensary-to-consumer deliveries have shot up significantly in the month of March as the gravity of the crisis surrounding the novel virus has sunken in among residents.
The Times detailed:
“When it comes to what, specifically, customers are buying, the dispensaries we checked in with report that flower (a.k.a. the dried buds of the marijuana plant) remains the top-selling category but that there has been a noticeable rise in the edibles category (THC-infused gummies, chocolates and the like). Sweet Flower and Airfield Supply Company both point to Kiva Confections’ Midnight Blueberry Camino gummies with 5 mg THC and 1 mg of CBN per piece (CBN is a cannabinoid associated with inducing a restful night’s sleep) as being particularly popular.”

On Thursday evening, Gov. Newsom issued an unprecedented order that requires nearly 40 million residents of California to stay at home for an indefinite amount of time as the state copes with rising coronavirus infection numbers and grim forecasts about potential outbreak scenarios. The order came only an hour after officials in L.A. county issued a similar mandate, and days after Bay Area counties gave similar orders.
As of Thursday night, 958 people have tested positive for the CoViD-19 novel virus while 19 people have died so far.
During his address, Newsom said:
“This is a moment we need to make tough decisions … This is a moment where we need some straight talk and we need to tell people the truth: We need to bend the curve in the state of California.”
CA is issuing a statewide, mandatory STAY AT HOME order.
Those that work in critical sectors should go to work. Grocery stores, pharmacies, banks and more will stay open.
We need to meet this moment and flatten the curve together.

Johns Hopkins Doctor Warns: “What Happened In Wuhan Could Happen Here”,"



Facebook

(ZH Opinion) — Renowned Johns Hopkins surgeon, researcher and policy expert Martin Makary told CNBC on Tuesday morning that the virus outbreak in Wuhan, China, could be easily replicated across America.
“What happened in Wuhan could happen here. Why do we think otherwise?” Makary said.
Makary said the immune system of a typical American is “not stronger than the Chinese immune system,” adding that “viruses don’t care about politics and they don’t care about location.”
With 750 cases of Covid-19, the airborne virus is quickly spreading across the US, now seen in more than 30 states, with officials in several states declaring a state of emergency. The lack of test kits, limited travel restrictions, and no vaccine for 12-18 months suggest that the map below will get a lot redder in the coming weeks:

Makary said, “We need to tell people right now to stop all nonessential travel. I feel strongly about that,” adding he does not “like the idea of talking about contingency plans, but we’ve got to start making these plans.”

What’s becoming increasingly evident is that America isn’t ready for a virus outbreak. He said the virus could cause havoc on the health care system for upwards of three months. “If we get 200,000 critical care cases, we’re going to be overrun,” he warned. “So we need to do more” to prepare for the worst.
President Trump is well aware of the present situation and how the virus is crashing the stock market. He said Monday, “nothing is shut down, life and the economy go on.” But Trump’s optically pleasing headlines are much different than what his Secretary of Health and Human Services, Alex Azar, is saying, who warned that “everyone should take precautions regarding the virus.”
The first indications that the US could be transforming into a Wuhan-like scenario are in areas such as King County, Washington; Santa Clara, California; Los Angeles; and the Tri-state area, where confirmed cases have been soaring in the last few days. Without travel restrictions and the lack of test kits, the virus is a perfect storm that could lead to thousands of more infected in the weeks ahead.

(TMU) — Italian mayors have started to become extremely hostile in their public addresses, as many citizens are refusing to comply with the social distancing orders that have been put into place.
Vincenzo De Luca, mayor of the Italian town of Campania, gave an angry speech from his Facebook page where he threatened to send police “with flamethrowers” to illegal gatherings like graduations parties that were happening in the midst of the nationwide quarantine.
“I’m getting news that some [people] would like to throw graduation parties… We will send police. With flamethrowers,” De Luca said, according to the National Post.
In another rant published to social media, Massimiliano Presciutti, the mayor of Reggio Calabria, complained of people walking their dogs like Will Smith in I Am Legend.
“Where the f*** are you all going? You and your dogs… which must have an inflamed prostate?” he said in a video circulating on social media.
Presciutti claimed that he stopped dog walkers on the street to shame them about being outside.
“I stopped him and said, ‘Look, this isn’t a movie. You are not Will Smith in I Am Legend. Go home,” he said.
Antonio Tutolo, the mayor of Lucera, was upset that people were going out to get their hair done.
“Getting in mobile hairdressers? What the f*** is that for? Who the f*** is supposed to even see you with your hair all done in a casket? Do you understand the casket will be closed?” he said.

The streets are mostly empty throughout the country, but there are still some people who are defying the order for a variety of reasons. Police say that at least 40,000 people were fined for being outside in the first week of the lockdown. Italians who are found to break quarantine while being infected with the virus could face up to 21 years in prison.
Even gatherings like funerals have also been banned. At least 50 people in Sicily are facing serious criminal charges after breaking the quarantine order after having a funeral for a loved one.
Italy has the worst experience with the CoViD-19 virus than any other country thus far, with over 6,000 deaths and 64,000 cases of the illness. However, the number of new cases in the country have started to decline in recent days, giving hope that the worst could be over.

New York Hospital Giving Coronavirus Patients Massive Amounts of Vitamin C,"



Facebook

Reddit







Email



(TMU) — As New York state’s hospital system faces an unprecedented surge of sick coronavirus patients, some doctors have reportedly found success in improving their symptoms through the application of massive Vitamin C doses.
The administering of 1,500 milligrams of intravenous Vitamin C is over 16 times the recommended dietary allowance of the antioxidant, but has resulted in patients treated with the vitamin faring “significantly” better than those patients who aren’t receiving the treatment, reports the New York Post.
According to pulmonologist and critical-care specialist Dr. Andrew G. Weber, who is affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, intensive-care patients infected with the novel virus are immediately administered the massive dosage when they arrive in ICU. The powerful vitamin C dosage is re-administered intravenously three or four times per day, he added.
Weber explained that the inspiration for the treatment comes after doctors in Shanghai, China, also used it.
China is conducting a clinical trial of 24,000 mg/day of intravenous vitamin C for coronavirus patients. They will receive it for 7 days straight at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. Honor and thanks to Zhiyong Peng, MD, for making this happen. https://t.co/x9lpnmoXVm
— Yardley Wong (@yardleywong) February 12, 2020

Weber told the Post:
“The patients who received Vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get Vitamin C.
It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it’s not a sexy drug.”
The Vitamin C is administered along with medicines including the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine as well as the antibiotic azithromycin, various biologics and blood thinners, Weber added.
While there is no scientific research that supports the use of high doses of Vitamin C in the treatment of CoViD-19, intravenous Vitamin C has long been used by some doctors to treat cold and flu symptoms.
According to a study published in 1999, “Overall, reported flu and cold symptoms in the test group decreased 85% compared with the control group after the administration of megadose Vitamin C.”
The study concluded:
“Vitamin C in megadoses administered before or after the appearance of cold and flu symptoms relieved and prevented the symptoms in the test population compared with the control group.”
Weber said that coronavirus patients see dramatic falls in their levels of Vitamin C when they suffer sepsis, the lethal inflammatory response to CoViD-19 infection.
He added:
“It makes all the sense in the world to try and maintain this level of Vitamin C.”
Clinical trials of the treatment began February 14 at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China, where the disease rapidly emerged last December. The study is expected to run through the end of September after which study findings will be published.
On Tuesday, hospitals in New York were granted permission from federal authorities to use a mixture of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to treat severely ill patients on the basis of “compassionate care.”
President Trump has tweeted that the cocktail has “a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” despite health officials urging caution about treating the drug as some panacea prior to rigorous clinical studies.
However, some experts have cautioned that the experimental intravenous treatment’s ability to fight off pneumonia remains unproven.
“Although vitamin C does have some small effect on the common cold, it’s unlikely that taking large amounts of vitamin C supplements will cure a COVID-19 infection—or have a large effect at all,” Peter McCaffery, professor of biochemistry at the University of Aberdeen, wrote in the Conversation.
Carol DerSarkissian, MD told MedicineNet:
“Your immune system does need Vitamin C to work right. But extra won’t help you avoid a cold. It may make it go away faster or not feel as bad—if you were taking it before you got sick.”

38% of Americans Refuse to Buy Corona Beer “Under Any Circumstance”,"

(TMU) — As the world struggles to control the novel coronavirus outbreak, Mexican beer brand Corona has suffered despite having no connection with the disease.
5W Public Relations revealed Thursday that 38 percent of beer-drinking Americans refuse to buy Corona “under any circumstances” while another 14 percent said they wouldn’t order a Corona in public. In the meantime, 16 percent of beer-drinkers in the U.S. were confused as to whether the beer and the virus are related. The survey encompassed polling from 737 beer drinkers in the United States.
As seen in the tweet below, the popular corporate media outlet CNN falsely tweeted that “38% of Americans wouldn’t buy Corona beer “under any circumstances” because of the coronavirus, according to a recent survey.”
This led to a flurry of misinformation across social media on Friday with people parroting the statistic that 38 percent of Americans think Corona beer is linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The survey, it turns, out, does not say this!
What it says:-38% of beer drinkers say they wouldn't buy Corona (for any reason at all, including, presumably…they prefer other beer)-4% of people who usually drink Corona say they would stophttps://t.co/X4Wa6tLR3z https://t.co/r37un3LRSG
— Ariel Edwards-Levy (@aedwardslevy) February 28, 2020

As it turns out, only 4% of people who typically drink Corona beer have said that they will stop.
In a separate survey conducted by YouGov, the firm found that consumer intent to purchase Corona has plummeted to its lowest level in two years. The survey also showed that Corona’s buzz score—a metric measuring favorability—has likewise fallen by a significant measure since the beginning of the year.
Despite the public relations nightmare, parent company Constellation Brands isn’t planning to make any marketing changes. Constellation, which brews a number of variations of the popular beverage, said in a statement that its customers “understand there is no link between the virus and our business.”
Constellation Brands spokesperson Stephanie McGuane told CNN:
“Sales of Corona remain very strong and we appreciate the continued support from our fans. 
Our advertising with Corona is consistent with the campaign we have been running for the last 30 years and is based off strong consumer sentiment.”
However, the outbreak of the disease could spell disaster for the company as it rolls out a new Corona-branded hard seltzer through a $40 million promotional campaign. Early sponsored tweets advertising the drink as “coming ashore soon” have already sparked a backlash on social media, with some claiming the ad is in “poor taste” and that the brand should “lay low for a few weeks.”
Truth. EXTREMELY POOR TASTE. Pun intended. Not your fsult, but-this? Seriously? bc btw, now youve ensured that Ill never buy it ever again.Plenty if other beers on tbe planet, if we live through this unrolling deadly highly contagious spreading virus. FY
— Wycked Yum 🔄 (@Wycked_Yum) February 27, 2020

Beginning January 18, online searches for “beer virus,” “corona beer virus,” and “beer coronavirus” began surging across search engines, according to Google Trends.
On Thursday, Constellation Brands reported that its stock had dropped by 8 percent. However, the entire stock market has also been plummeting, with stocks of all kinds dropping across the board due in part to fears related to the fast-spreading virus.

(CONVERSATION) — Snakes, the Chinese krait and the Chinese cobra, may be the original source of the newly discovered coronavirus that has triggered an outbreak of a deadly infectious respiratory illness in China this winter.
Chinese researchers conclude that the coronavirus most likely came from snakes. Or as they put it: ""Homologous recombination within the spike glycoprotein of the newly identified coronavirus may boost cross‐species transmission from snake to human""https://t.co/FIs234X79z

The illness was first reported in late December 2019 in Wuhan, a major city in central China, and has been rapidly spreading. Since then, sick travelers from Wuhan have infected people in China and other countries, including the United States.
Using samples of the virus isolated from patients, scientists in China have determined the genetic code of the virus and used microscopes to photograph it. The pathogen responsible for this pandemic is a new coronavirus. It’s in the same family of viruses as the well-known severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have killed hundreds of people in the past 17 years. The World Health Organization (WHO) has named the new coronavirus 2019-nCoV.
We are virologists and journal editors and are closely following this outbreak because there are many questions that need to be answered to curb the spread of this public health threat.
The name of coronavirus comes from its shape, which resembles a crown or solar corona when imaged using an electron microscope.
Coronavirus is transmitted through the air and primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of mammals and birds. Though most of the members of the coronavirus family only cause mild flu-like symptoms during infection, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can infect both upper and lower airways and cause severe respiratory illness and other complications in humans.
This new 2019-nCoV causes similar symptoms to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. People infected with these coronaviruses suffer a severe inflammatory response.
Unfortunately, there is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment available for coronavirus infection. A better understanding of the life cycle of 2019-nCoV, including the source of the virus, how it is transmitted and how it replicates are needed to both prevent and treat the disease.
Both SARS and MERS are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. This was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans.
Now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person. Field studies have revealed that the original source of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is the bat, and that the masked palm civets (a mammal native to Asia and Africa) and camels, respectively, served as intermediate hosts between bats and humans.
In the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalized were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles. However, since no one has ever reported finding a coronavirus infecting aquatic animals, it is plausible that the coronavirus may have originated from other animals sold in that market.
The hypothesis that the 2019-nCoV jumped from an animal at the market is strongly supported by a new publication in the Journal of Medical Virology. The scientists conducted an analysis and compared the genetic sequences of 2019-nCoV and all other known coronaviruses.
The study of the genetic code of 2019-nCoV reveals that the new virus is most closely related to two bat SARS-like coronavirus samples from China, initially suggesting that, like SARS and MERS, the bat might also be the origin of 2019-nCoV. The authors further found that the DNA coding sequence of 2019-nCoV spike protein, which forms the “crown” of the virus particle that recognizes the receptor on a host cell, indicates that the bat virus might have mutated before infecting people.
But when the researchers performed a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the sequence of 2019-nCoV, it suggests that this coronavirus might come from snakes.
The researchers used an analysis of the protein codes favored by the new coronavirus and compared it to the protein codes from coronaviruses found in different animal hosts, like birds, snakes, marmots, hedgehogs, manis, bats and humans. Surprisingly, they found that the protein codes in the 2019-nCoV are most similar to those used in snakes.
Snakes often hunt for bats in wild. Reports indicate that snakes were sold in the local seafood market in Wuhan, raising the possibility that the 2019-nCoV might have jumped from the host species – bats – to snakes and then to humans at the beginning of this coronavirus outbreak. However, how the virus could adapt to both the cold-blooded and warm-blooded hosts remains a mystery.
The authors of the report and other researchers must verify the origin of the virus through laboratory experiments. Searching for the 2019-nCoV sequence in snakes would be the first thing to do. However, since the outbreak, the seafood market has been disinfected and shut down, which makes it challenging to trace the new virus’ source animal.
Sampling DNA from animals sold at the market and from wild snakes and bats is needed to confirm the origin of the virus. Nonetheless, the reported findings will also provide insights for developing prevention and treatment protocols.
The 2019-nCoV outbreak is another reminder that people should limit the consumption of wild animals to prevent zoonotic infections.

UN Chief Calls for Global Ceasefire Amid “Absolutely Devastating” Pandemic,"

(TMU) — The head of the United Nations has issued a passionate appeal for a global ceasefire to take effect across the world that would give authorities and medical professionals alike the ability to focus exclusively on defeating the coronavirus pandemic.
In the appeal issued on Monday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres demanded that the global truce be adopted for the sake of defeating the threat of CoViD-19 to all of humankind and especially the vulnerable—women and children, the disabled, marginalized, displaced and refugees.
In his address, which was delivered to reporters via live video feed in consideration of social distancing guidelines, Guterres said:
“The fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war.
That is why today, I am calling for an immediate global ceasefire in all corners of the world. It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown and focus together on the true fight of our lives.” 
The comments come as Syria reported its very first confirmed case of CoViD-19, signaling an ugly turn for a country already ripped apart after a decade of war, while other cases continue to emerge in military flashpoints like Afghanistan, the Gaza Strip, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The U.N. chief stressed that the coronavirus doesn’t discriminate on a basis of “nationality or ethnicity, faction or faith.” Instead, “it attacks all, relentlessly.” However, the most vulnerable—those in war zones—would likely face “devastating losses” from the disease due to being caught between a war and a devastating pandemic.
#COVID19 does not care about nationality or ethnicity, faction or faith. It attacks all, relentlessly.
Meanwhile, armed conflict rages on around the world and the most vulnerable pay the highest price.
That's why I'm calling for an immediate global ceasefire.
— António Guterres (@antonioguterres) March 24, 2020

Additionally, those health systems in countries devastated by war have already been either destroyed or reached the verge of total collapse, ensuring that those health workers brave enough to venture into the field are often placed directly in the line of fire or into the crosshairs of warring parties.
Addressing warfighters across the globe, Guterres said:
“Pull back from hostilities. Put aside mistrust and animosity. Silence the guns; stop the artillery; end the airstrikes.
This is crucial… To help create corridors for life-saving aid. To open precious windows for diplomacy. To bring hope to places among the most vulnerable to COVID-19.”
To warring parties: Pull back from hostilities. Silence the guns; stop the artillery; end the airstrikes. This is crucial to help create corridors for life-saving aid, open windows for diplomacy & bring hope to places among the most vulnerable to #COVID19 – @antonioguterres
— UN Spokesperson (@UN_Spokesperson) March 23, 2020

Continuing, he stressed:
“End the sickness of war and fight the disease that is ravaging our world. It starts by stopping the fighting everywhere. Now. That is what our human family needs, now more than ever.
… If the fighting goes on, we might have an absolutely devastating spreading of the epidemic.”
The U.N. secretary-general has been calling for a global response to the pandemic which he has said places the lives of “millions at risk.” The United Nations will soon unveil a detailed humanitarian relief plan that would be worldwide in scope.
During a question-and-answer session with reporters at the “virtual” press conference, Guterres expressed that he felt “strongly determined” to make the most of the U.N.’s mandate despite the organization’s existing duties in the humanitarian, peacekeeping, diplomatic, cultural, and other fields.
He explained:
“It’s a moment in which the U.N. must be able to address the peoples of the world and appeal for a massive mobilization and for a massive pressure on governments to make sure that we are able to respond to this crisis, not to mitigate it but to suppress it, to suppress the disease and to address the dramatic economic and social impacts of the disease.
And we can only do it if we do it together, if we do in a coordinated way, if we do it with intense solidarity and cooperation, and that is the raison d’etre of the United Nations itself.”

(TMU) — News about the novel coronavirus spreading throughout the United States and across the world is developing rapidly. It can be difficult and overwhelming to keep up with everything happening so we’ve sifted through hundreds of articles and pulled out what we feel are the most important developments so you don’t have to.


Here are six things you need to know about COVID-19!
Posted by Emma Leigh on Wednesday, March 4, 2020
Here are six huge breaking news events that you need to know about the global outbreak of COVID-19 and the novel coronavirus.
On Monday, March 2 the second COVID-19-linked death in the United States was announced. Seemingly overnight, that total increased to at least 10, two of which were declared retroactively.
A female in her 80s and a male in his 50s both died in Washington state on February 26 but were not linked to COVID-19 until March 3. All of the COVID-19 deaths in the United States so far have been in the Seattle area.
According to King County, those deaths include:
A female in her 80s, resident of LifeCare, never hospitalized, died at her family home on 2/26/20
A male in his 50s, resident of LifeCare, hospitalized at Harborview Medical Center and died on 2/26/20
A male in his 70s, a resident of LifeCare, hospitalized at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland. The man had underlying health conditions, and died 3/1/20
A female in her 70s, a resident of LifeCare, hospitalized at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland. The woman had underlying health conditions, and died 3/1/20
A male in his 70s, a resident of LifeCare, hospitalized at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland. The man had underlying health conditions, and died 3/1/20
A female in her 70s, a resident of LifeCare, hospitalized at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland. The woman had underlying health conditions, and died 3/1/20
A female in her 80s, hospitalized at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland. This person died on 3/1/20
A male in his 70s was hospitalized at EvergreenHealth. He had underlying health conditions and died on 2/29/20
A woman in her 70s, who was a resident of LifeCare in Kirkland, hospitalized at EvergreenHealth and died on 3/2/20
A man in his 50s, who was hospitalized and died 2/28/20 at EvergreenHealth
However, the sister of a 54 year old Tacoma, WA man (former top aide in DC for a US senator) has announced his death due to COVID-19 in a Facebook post that has since been changed to private. He reportedly passed away Monday, March 2 and does not appear to be included in the tally above.
Also in Washington, an Amazon employee at one of the company’s Seattle offices has tested positive. According to Amazon, “The employee went home feeling unwell on Tuesday, February 25 and has not entered Amazon offices since that time.”
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) closed their Washington office on Tuesday, according to DHS Secretary Chad Wolf.
King County, the county in which Seattle is located, has announced plans to purchase a motel to house coronavirus patients. King County also plans to use modular housing for this purpose.
Meanwhile, first responders and medical staff are testing positive for the virus.
Shocking leaked footage shows bodies piling up at a local morgue in Qom, Iran, said to be victims of the country’s spiraling COVID-19 outbreak.
As of Tuesday, Iranian health officials announced 2,336 total cases and 77 dead.

On Tuesday, Iran put its armed forces on alert as the virus spread throughout the country, even infecting and killing members of parliament. There are now 23 COVID-19 cases among Iranian parliament members.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gave the green light to mobilize 300,000 soldiers and volunteers.
Expediency Council member Mohammad Mirmohammadi, an advisor to Iran’s supreme leader, died on Monday.
The World Health Organization (WHO) now estimates the COVID-19 death rate to be 3.4 percent—higher than previous estimates.

The WHO previously praised China’s efforts in dealing with the novel coronavirus and is now recommending the aggressive containment measures used.
According to a tweet from CBC, WHO “has examined the data and believes the decline in coronavirus cases in China since the end of last month is real. The agency says with similar aggressive containment measures, other countries could also see a decline.”

WHO has called on both industry leaders and governments to boost the manufacture of protective gear by 40 percent.
According to the UN, “some 89 million medical masks, 76 million examination gloves and 1.6 million goggles will be needed for the COVID-19 response every month while the epidemic lasts.”
Thus far, the organization has “supplied around half a million sets of protective equipment to 47 affected countries, but these supplies are rapidly running out.”
According to the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), defense leaders have been meeting for the past six weeks to make plans on how to respond in the event the novel coronavirus spread to the U.S. from China. “We’ve issued a variety of [memoranda] and directives advising the force on how to deal with coronavirus,” Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper said.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) officials are preparing for a possible “infectious disease emergency declaration,” according to documents reviewed by NBC.
The declaration would allow FEMA to provide federal assistance and disaster relief funding to state and local governments to combat the coronavirus. “To me this is another indication that the president and the White House are finally aware of the gravity of the situation,” former FEMA official Michael Coen said.
Rep. Mark Pocan from Wisconsin sent a letter to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Dr. Robert Redfield expressing his concerns about COVID-19 testing data being tracked and provided to the public, or lack thereof.
On its website, the CDC had been publicly posting the number of people it had tested for the virus. The data is no longer there and a statement reads: “CDC is no longer reporting the number of persons under investigation (PUIs) that have been tested, as well as PUIs that have tested negative.”
Pocan pointed out that the CDC successfully keeps track of national health data for a wide range of diseases and should therefore be able to keep track of data related to the novel coronavirus.
After a flurry of negative response to the massive cost burden of the test for COVID-19, Seema Verma, an administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that all costs associated with the test will now be covered by Medicare and Medicaid. The remarks followed a Tuesday announcement from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence indicating that the CDC would revise their guidelines for testing and that “any American can be tested (for coronavirus), no restrictions, subject to doctors’ orders.”
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Stephen Hahn said at the White House on Monday evening that U.S. labs will have enough materials by the end of the week to perform “close to 1 million” tests.
However, according to Politico, data provided by Association of Public Health Laboratories shows public health labs should be able to run up to 10,000 tests per day by the end of this week.
Tech giant Google has cancelled one of its biggest annual events, the I/O Conference that was slated to take place in San Fransisco, California May 12 to 14 of this year. The company previously decided to ban all non-critical business travel and move its annual Cloud Next conference online.
Google said that those who purchased tickets for the event, which was slated to take place between May 12-14, will be refunded by March 13 at the latest.
Twitter has told all of its 5,000 employees around the world to work from home and has made working form home mandatory for its employees in Hong Kong, Japan, and South Korea.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have announced that April meetings will be held in a “virtual format” due to the outbreak. According to U.S. News and World Report, the Spring Meetings scheduled this year April 17-19 “usually bring some 10,000 government officials, business people, civil society representatives and journalists from across the globe to a tightly packed, two-block area of downtown Washington that houses their headquarters.”

Massive Monkey Gangs Are Fighting for Food on Streets as Tourist Food Disappears,"

(ZH) — Coronavirus isn’t just causing humans to fight in the aisles of Target over toilet paper. Today in “signs of the apocalypse”, hungry monkey gangs are also swarming and fighting—for food—on the streets of Thailand.
Monkeys in the country are usually well fed by tourists who visit Central Thailand, but visitors have plummeted as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, which has hit the Asian region hard.
The animals shown in a video are reported to be two separate “rival gangs” that dwell in the city, according to the Daily Mail.
Half of the monkeys are said to live in the temple areas, while the others live in the city. The two groups don’t usually meet but ended up doing so this past week.
The animals are shown wandering separately looking for food, but once one monkey finds a banana, the chase is on.
The ferocity of the animals shocked even locals, who are used to seeing the monkeys on a daily basis. One onlooker, who captured video, said: “They looked more like wild dogs than monkeys. They went crazy for the single piece of food. I’ve never seen them this aggressive.”
The onlooker explained: “I think the monkeys were very, very hungry. There’s normally a lot of tourists here to feed the monkeys but now there are not as many, because of the coronavirus.”
Hundreds of monkeys are shown in this Daily Mail video fighting over a single banana:

Wannabe “Influencer” Claims to Be Hospitalized From Coronavirus After Licking Public Toilets,"

(TMU) — As the coronavirus pandemic has shown, humans are paradoxical creatures.
On the one hand, we’ve witnessed tremendous mass heroism and strength from medical workers and health care personnel across the world who are fighting to contain the pandemic and minimize the horrific loss of life. On the other hand, we’ve seen some people throw caution to the wind and utterly disregard warnings from public health officials.
This has been clear from the scenes of young people flocking to beaches across the world, ignoring social distancing guidelines, and other tales of stupefying foolishness sparked by the crisis.
In the case of one social media influencer from California, the foolishness may have reached the point of suicidal idiocy after he claims that he was hospitalized with the coronavirus mere days after he posted video footage of himself licking a toilet bowl for the latest dangerous online “challenge.”
The notorious prankster from Beverly Hills known as Larz, who has also claimed to be a part of the infamous influencer Jake Paul’s entourage, posted footage of himself in a hospital bed on Sunday, reports the Daily Mail.

In a tweet from an account that has since been suspended, the 21-year-old who goes by the social media handle @GayShawnMendes wrote:
 “I tested positive for Coronavirus.”

While it’s difficult to take the words of the wannabe influencer seriously, the video came just two days after he was caught rubbing his tongue across public toilets in a disgusting so-called “Coronavirus Challenge.”
The bizarre challenge, which has mainly been posted to video-sharing platform TikTok, has entailed various online personalities also licking public toilets, grocery store produce, and even poles on trains and buses.
However, given Larz’s notorious history of plumbing the depths of antisocial cretinism in his wild hunt for social media clout, we remain skeptical about his claims.
Larz previously gained notoriety and even appeared on the television show Dr. Phil last year after he posted video of himself eating from tubs of ice cream from store freezers with his bare hands before returning them to the shelf. The wannabe viral star later bragged that the reprehensible act made him “lots of money.”

Gates-Funded Program to Distribute Home-Testing Kits for COVID-19 in Seattle,"

(ZH) — The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will soon begin distributing at-home testing kits for Seattle-area residents who suspect they have contracted COVID-19, according to a new report in the Seattle Times.
Test kits could become available as soon as this week, via a lab funded by the foundation, could start testing hundreds per day with scaling availability in the weeks ahead.
“Although there’s a lot to be worked out, this has enormous potential to turn the tide of the epidemic,” Scott Dowell, who is in charge of the COVID-19 response effort by the foundation, told the Times.
“One of the most important things from our perspective, having watched and worked on this in other parts of the world, is the identification of people who are positive for the virus, so they can be safely isolated and cared for, and the identification of their contacts, who can then be quarantined,” Dowell said.
News of the test kits comes as confirmed cases in the US surge above 500 across 34 states. Washington state, specifically the Seattle Metropolitan Area, has been the hardest hit region in the country, with 16 deaths and 128 confirmed cases.
The Gates Foundation has spent more than $20 million in the virus response effort and has committed at least $5 million for the Seattle area.
Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, warned last week that actual cases in Seattle could be around 600. Bedford said cases could soar to 12,000 to 30,000 by the end of the month if virus containment measures weren’t in place to slow down the transmission rate.
While the foundation’s urgency for developing a new test kit is timely, Gates was apart of The Event 201 scenario in October (months before COVID-19) that modeled a breakout of coronavirus across the world.

With the COVID-19 breakout only just getting started on the continental US, expect this map to be much redder in the coming weeks. One can only hope the foundation can ramp up test kits, considering there’s a massive shortage at hospitals.

(TMU) — According to the map of global CoViD-19 cases provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), the total number of confirmed cases in the United States is 808 while the total cases worldwide has climbed to 118,101. The map indicates that there are 4,262 deaths worldwide with 29 occurring in the U.S.
The map uses data from WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC, DXY, and local media reports. The map is only as accurate as the data coming from these organizations and local media. It is important to remember that only those patients who are tested can be confirmed and thus accounted for in the data.
At least 17 U.S. states have now declared states of emergency or made disaster declarations including New Jersey, Oregon, California, New York, Washington, Kentucky, Maryland, Ohio, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Florida, Colorado, Illinois, Rhode Island, Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.

The CDC is warning that people over 60 in addition to those with underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and lung disease, take precautions including reducing travel and stocking up on food and medications.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has finally said that the coronavirus is starting to look like a “real pandemic.” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Monday that WHO is “encouraged” by Italy’s quarantine.

Please continue to check TMU for important updates and follow along with the very latest news on Telegram.
The state of Colorado has thus far tested 184 people for CoViD-29, with 12 cases identified.
Despite recent announcements from U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during a Coronavirus Task Force press briefing at the White House on Monday in which he said “testing is now available in all state labs in every state in the country” and that more than “a million tests have been distributed,” the Kirkland Life Care Center just outside of Seattle remains unable to test its workers.
The nursing home said on Monday that it had no kits to test its employees that are showing symptoms, more than a third of the nursing home’s 180 employees.
Spokesman Tim Killian said, “We would like more kits to test employees.” Adding, “We’ve been asking the various government agencies that have been supplying us with test kits.”
A first responder has told CNN that none of the Life Care Center’s 200 employees have been tested despite 65 of them showing symptoms and that test kits from first responders have been held up so long at a overwhelmed lab that they have now expired.
2/ Those 7 firefighters now must be re-tested and remain in quarantine/isolation longer. 
The first responder also says that they are being told by Life Care Center that none of the nearly 200 employees from Life Care have been tested. (65 employees reportedly have symptoms.)
— Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) March 10, 2020

During the briefing at the White House, Pence revealed that he has not yet been tested for CoViD-19 despite recently attending a conference with a person who has had a positive test. Pence also indicated he did not know whether or not U.S. President Donald Trump had been tested.
According to a study out of China, global CoViD-19 cases “will increase tenfold every 19 days if no drastic measures are taken to contain its spread.” The researchers said, “The situation is dangerous … we call on the world to take strong actions on public health, using experiences learned from China and Singapore.”
Another Chinese study has found that the novel coronavirus can travel twice as far as the “safe distance” previously advised by world health authorities. According to the study, the virus can travel nearly 15 feet and can linger in the air for 30 minutes. They also found that the virus can last for days on surfaces where respirator droplets have landed. According to the study, it can last for two to three days on surfaces like glass, metal, plastic, paper, and fabric at around 98ºF.
However, the South China Morning Post now notes that the study was retracted by the journal Practical Preventative Medicine without explanation in what is a perfect example of the confusing, conflicting, and constantly changing news and research surrounding both the novel coronavirus and CoViD-19.
Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Monday during a news conference, “China describes this as being highly contagious, and there essentially is no immunity against this virus in the population because it’s a new virus,” indicating that the virus does indeed warrant a two-week quarantine.
Messonnier also said, “It’s fair to say that as the trajectory of the outbreak continues, many people in the United States either this year or next year will be exposed to this. And there is a good chance many will become sick.”
But even a 14-day quarantine may not suffice in some cases. According to the Baltimore Sun, “There will be people who develop symptoms and remain contagious after being released from the 14-day quarantine.” And that number may be around 101 people for every 10,000 cases.
Dr. Dean Sidelinger, a public health officer with the Oregon Health Authority said at a press conference on Monday:
“We do think that even though we are reporting 14 cases, that this disease is much more widespread in our community. Many of these cases were identified as potential community transmission—meaning that we can’t trace it back to an individual or to a situation where they were put at risk.”
Authorities in Oregon expect the number of cases to increase as testing becomes more widely available. 
Canada has reported the country’s first death has their total infected rises to 79.
It has become apparent that the coronavirus spreads easily and rapidly in contained environments, from conferences to nursing homes to cruise ships.
As of Monday, eight cases of CoViD-19 have been confirmed in the state of Iowa. Seven of the eight cases are located in Johnson County and are all seven of those individuals traveled on the same cruise in Egypt, known as both the NS River Anuket or Asara, according to authorities. A disaster proclamation has been declared in the state, as the results of 11 tests remain pending. 67 people are being monitored by health officials.
A Taiwanese-American tourist who was a passenger on the cruise was the first to be confirmed positive after returning to Taiwan.
It was reported on March 5 that the Grand Princess cruise ship had 3,533 people on board including 2,422 passengers and 1,111 crew members. On March 6, Vice President Pence reported that 46 tests were run which revealed 19 crew members and 2 passengers to be positive. On March 7, a critically ill passenger and a passenger traveling with that person were airlifted off the ship.
The Grand Princess docked in Oakland, California on Monday after being held off the coast of California for days. Filmmaker and area resident Robbie Martin visited the docking as news helicopters filmed the scene from above. 


Additional passengers are disembarking today, Tuesday, March 10.

Martin got as close to ship as possible and was surprised to find no visible U.S. government officials or significant activity outside of what was happening immediately next to the ship. No Oakland City Council members or representatives were present and there appeared to be no plans for a press conference or briefing from government officials dealing with the disembarking of passengers. Martin indicated that the area was surprisingly unsecure.
A third Princess cruise ship is now being kept at sea, according to the Independent. The Caribbean Princess was schedule to dock on Monday in Grand Cayman but passengers and crew will first be required to undergo testing before disembarking. Two crew members on the Caribbean Princess transferred from the Grand Princess, sparking concern that the novel coronavirus may now be spreading throughout the ship.
The number of positive cases of CoViD-19 associated with the Biogen conference that was held in Boston in February continues to increase. More than two dozen people from around the country who attended the conference have now tested positive.
Martin Makary, a renowned Johns Hopkins surgeon, researcher and policy expert, told CNBC on Tuesday, “What happened in Wuhan could happen here. Why do we think otherwise?” Makary pointed out that the immune system of the average American is “not stronger than the Chinese immune system.”
Two years ago, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the shutdown of the White House National Security Council’s global health security unit. The president has struggled to justify this decision amidst the coronavirus pandemic. 
And in 2018, Rear Admiral Timothy Ziemer, Senior Director for Global Health Security and Biodefense at the National Security Council starting in April 2017, was responsible for leading pandemic preparedness and response efforts but abruptly left the position. Following his departure, the team he oversaw was disbanded by then national security adviser John Bolton, as TMU previously reported.

Regardless of what actions have been taken since the emergence of the novel coronavirus, it is becoming quite clear the the United States was already ill-prepared for dealing with anything of this nature.
According to the Independent, U.S. health officials are suggesting that hospitals in the U.S. need to at least double their available beds in order to deal with the expected surge of patients who will need in patient care. Health officials report that there are fewer than 100,000 intensive care beds available in the U.S. while the American Hospital Associate puts that number at 45,000. 
It is estimated that upwards of 865,000 people will require hospitalization if the outbreak proves to be moderate while 9.9 million will require hospitalization in the event it is severe.
UC San Francisco Medical Center is preparing by setting up two outdoor tents to care for patients with respiratory symptoms, according to the SF Gate.
“The tents will be used for triage to make sure that people who come in with respiratory illnesses of any kind don’t spread them to others in our emergency department.”
New Jersey’s first coronavirus case is speaking out about his experience that he says “happened so quick.” The 32-year-old has been hospitalized since Tuesday after first going to urgent care. James Cai says he has experienced “Dirarrhea, watery eyes, shortness of breath, chest pain, you name it. High fever,” he said. “Every day is getting worse.”
Cai’s doctor believes he contracted the virus while attending a medical conference in New York City’s Times Square.
The nursing home at the center of Washington state’s outbreak is reporting grim news of the virus’ effect on some patients who have died.

Tim Killian, the Life Care Center’s press liaison claims, “some residents go from no symptoms to death in just a matter of a few hours.” 
“It was surprising and shocking to us that we have seen that level of escalation from symptoms to death.” 
In an attempt to find a vaccine, UK researchers are looking for volunteers willing to be infected with the virus. They will be offered £3,500 for their trouble.
The entire country of Italy is now under lockdown as the country struggles to contain the outbreak. There are now more than 10,000 confirmed cases and 631 deaths.
As a result, the movement of more than 60 million people has been restricted. The decree bans all public events, closes cinemas, theaters, gyms, clubs, bars, funerals, weddings, and all sporting events, including Series A matches. All schools and universities will remain closed until April 3.
Tuesday morning Mongolia announced the barring of anyone from entering of leaving its cities for six days after also announcing the country’s very first case. Mongolia had already sealed its border with China and banned flights from South Korea. Despite those efforts, an employee of a French energy company who flew in from Moscow was confirmed to be infected.  
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested a citywide quarantine akin to what happened in northern Italy may be appropriate for the city. 
“It’s a possibility but I think people are getting a little ahead of ourselves and we should be careful,” he said Monday on CNN.
In a Monday press conference the governor of New York said that the state will begin making 100,000 gallons of hand sanitizer a week that will be given to schools, prisons, government agencies, and the MTA. Prisoners will make the hand sanitizer.
The New York National Guard was deployed on Tuesday to a health department command post in New Rochelle.
The governor of Washington said on Tuesday that the entire state of more than 7.5 million people may need to be quarantined due to the outbreak. Governor Jay Inslee said that cases may increase to 64,000 in less than two months if action isn’t taken. The quarantine would include mandatory restrictions on travel, according to KOMO. The state would expand unemployment benefits to assist those unable to work.
Israel is requiring that anyone arriving in the country self-quarantine for 14 days. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a tweet, “All those coming to Israel from abroad will be placed in isolation for 14 days.” Interior Minister Aryeh Deri reports that the measure is effective immediately.
Moscow is now on “high alert” and is threatening 5 years of jail time for people who fail to self-isolate for two weeks after visiting countries experiencing outbreaks including China, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.
Officials in the U.S. state of Georgia have designated a state park as a potential location for isolating and monitoring people who have been exposed to coronavirus. And the largest county in Georgia has cancelled school after an employee tested positive. 
Images and viral videos of empty planes are popping up across social media as the novel coronavirus continues to impact the travel industry.

An epidemiologist in Washington is warning, “It is likely that people you know will die from CoViD-19.”
The U.S. Military has cancelled military exercises and is quarantining ships as the virus spreads. The Pentagon has reportedly been planning how to continue operations in the event CoViD-19 spreads amongst its employees.
U.S. officials are reportedly worried about the drug supply chain as China continues to suffer the effects of the pandemic. “Basically we’ve outsourced our entire industry to China,” retired Brig. Gen. John Adams told NBC.
Author Rosemary Gibson, who wrote a book on this very subject, explained, “If China shut the door on exports of medicines and their key ingredients and raw material, U.S. hospitals and military hospitals and clinics would cease to function within months, if not days.”
New York, San Francisco, and Seattle are all showing lower weekend traffic than average in the midst of the global pandemic.

Harvey Weinstein Doesn’t Know That He Tested Positive For Coronavirus,"

(TMU) — Disgraced Hollywood film producer Harvey Weinstein has reportedly tested positive for coronavirus. Weinstein is currently serving a 23-year sentence and is now said to be in isolation to prevent the illness from spreading throughout the prison.
He has been moved around between a few different facilities in recent weeks, but it seems that he will remain at the Wende Correctional Facility in the state of New York for now. Officials at the prison told the Niagara Gazette that two inmates at the prison tested positive for the virus. A spokesperson for Weinstein told the Sun that he had not been informed about his diagnosis.
Just after his conviction, Weinstein complained of chest pains and was receiving regular medical evaluations during his incarceration. He had heart surgery two weeks ago at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan, which is now an epicenter for the virus in the United States, although it is not entirely clear when or where he contracted the illness.
All over the country, inmates are being released from prison under terms that range from clemency to house arrest, and it appears that Weinstein could be released because he is over 50 and at a high risk of illness because he recently had surgery.
According to a press release from the New York Board of Corrections:
“Significantly fewer people in jail will limit the spread of COVID-19 infection among people in custody and those who work in the jails, minimize the number of people in custody who will need medical care, decrease the density of housing areas for people who remain in jail, and allow New Yorkers to maintain connections with and support from their loved ones.”
“The New York City Board of Correction, the independent oversight Board for the City’s jail system, is calling on the City to work with all its criminal justice partners to: (1) immediately remove from jail all people at higher risk from COVID-19 infection; and (2) rapidly decrease the jail population,” the report continued.

(TT) — As we have highlighted in a few different reports since the COVID-19 coronavirus quarantines began, the extreme decrease in human activity has given the planet some space to breathe.
Obviously, the situation that the people of the world are dealing with right now is tragic, lives are being lost, and there are millions now facing unemployment due to the economic shutdown that has resulted from the quarantines.
It is unfortunate that the world would only slow down after experiencing the type of suffering that we have seen in recent months, but the drastic drop in pollution in the region’s affected by the outbreak, could be a potential silver lining to this terrible situation.
Sattelite images taken in the different parts of the world where there are intense quarantines have shown that there has been a drastic reduction of pollution in these areas.
Satellite images from NASA show falling levels of nitrogen dioxide over China in the past two months, correlating with the massive factor and travel shut down that has been taking place throughout the country. Scientists with NASA say that the reduction in nitrogen dioxide was first noticed around Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak where the quarantine was first imposed. When comparing satellite images of the past two years, it is apparent that nitrogen dioxide levels this year are significantly lower than last year.
It appears that something similar is also beginning to happen in Italy, which has also recently gone into a countrywide lockdown. The European Space Agency (ESA) released a timelapse video taken from space, which shows how drastically the air pollution has decreased.

Reduction of NO2 over Italy
New data from the Copernicus EU #Sentinel5P mission reveal a decline of air pollution, specifically nitrogen dioxide emissions, over Italy. This reduction is particularly visible in northern Italy which coincides with its nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of the #coronavirus 👉http://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2020/03/Coronavirus_nitrogen_dioxide_emissions_drop_over_Italy
Posted by ESA – European Space Agency on Friday, March 13, 2020
The iconic canals in Venice, Italy, have become crystal clear since the traffic has slowed down.
Now that the whole world is going into quarantine, it is very likely that similar results will be seen throughout the world, even in the United States, which is currently in the process of locking everyone down.
It would be great if humanity could learn some lessons through this experience. We have now been able to prove just how quickly humans can reverse the environmental trend that we have been contributing to for so long.
Unfortunately, once the coronavirus is no longer a major threat, the first priority for industrialized nations will be getting back to work, and world leaders have already shown that they are happy to roll back environmental regulations in order to get the economy going again.

Why Hand-Washing Really is as Important as Doctors Say,"



Facebook







Twitter







Reddit







Email



(CONVERSATION) — As the threat from the coronavirus grows, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health officials are stressing the importance of hand-washing.
Prevention becomes essential to stopping the spread of the virus because there is no vaccine to prevent it and no anti-virals to treat it.
How can such a simple, low-tech solution make a difference?
Remember – coronavirus spreads easily by droplets from breathing, coughing and sneezing. As our hands touch many surfaces, they can pick up microbes, including viruses. Then by touching contaminated hands to your eyes, nose or mouth, the pathogens can infect the body.
As a microbiologist, I think a lot about the differences between microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, and how they interact with animal hosts to drive health or disease. I was shocked to read a study that indicated that 93.2% of 2,800 survey respondents did not wash their hands after coughing or sneezing.
Let me explain how washing your hands decreases the number of microbes on your hands and helps prevent the spread of infectious diseases.
Bacteria and viruses are different in a number of ways. Bacteria are single-celled organisms that can reproduce on their own, while viruses constitute a core of genetic material encapsulated by a protein coat and can only reproduce by attaching themselves to host cells. Because viruses don’t have the organelles to reproduce, they “hijack” the cellular machinery of host cells to make multitudes of new viruses.
These differences are why antibiotics cannot kill viruses, which typically target specific structures in the cellular components of bacteria that are absent in viruses.
Despite their differences, however, the best way to prevent the disease of bacterial and viral pathogens alike is to effectively wash your hands.
There are two strategies to decreasing the amount of microbes on your hands.
The first is to decrease the overall biomass of microbes – that is, decrease the amount of bacteria, viruses and other types of microorganisms. We do this by lathering with soap and rinsing with water. Soap’s chemistry helps remove microorganisms from our hands by accentuating the slippery properties of our own skin.
The second strategy is to kill the microbes. We do this by using products with an antibacterial agent such as alcohols, chlorine, peroxides, chlorhexidine or triclosan. However, the efficacy on these agents can be variable depending on a given microbe.

Some academic work has shown that antibacterial soaps are more effective at reducing certain bacteria on soiled hands than soaps without them.
However, there’s a problem. Some bacterial cells on our hands may have genes that enable them to be resistant to a given antibacterial agent. This means that after the antibacterial agent kills some bacteria, the resistant strains remaining on the hands can flourish.
Further, the genes that allowed the bacteria to be resistant could pass along to other bacteria, causing more resistant strains. Even more important with respect to coronavirus, antibacterial agents, such as oral antibiotics, don’t kill viruses.
With this in mind, you may want to stick with plain old soap and water.
To clean our hands, the CDC recommends that we:
Wet hands with clean water
Apply soap and lather/scrub every nook and cranny of your hands for 20-30 seconds (about the time to sing “Happy Birthday” twice)
Rinse well with clean running water
Dry hands with a clean paper towel or air-dry.
During the 20-30 seconds of lathering the World Health Organization recommends incorporating six maneuvers to cover all parts of your hands.
If soap and water are not unavailable, the CDC recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% ethanol. Alcohols have a broad-spectrum of antimicrobial activity and are less selective for resistance compared to other antibacterial chemicals. Although alcohol-based hand sanitizers may not work on all classes of germs, the WHO recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand rub to kill viruses that may be on your hands.
The presence of some microbes isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact many of the microbes that live on or within us are essential for our health.
We live in a microbial world: Trillions of different microbes colonize our skin, gut and orifices. Collectively, this consortium of bacteria, archaea, fungi and viruses are called our microbiota. A plethora of exciting research suggests that the associations of animal hosts with their microbiota are fundamentally important for the host’s biology.
Our microbiota can protect us from germs by training our immune system and by colonization resistance – the characteristic of the intestinal microbiota to block colonization of pathogens. There is ample evidence suggesting that commensal bacteria regulate invading viruses, and in some cases have a suppressive role in their infections. For example, bacteria can prevent influenza virus infection by binding or trapping them directly or by producing metabolites that decrease the stability of influenza virions.
Although more research needs to be done to understand the intricate interactions between microbial communities with host cells, consistent work illustrates that a diverse population of microbes and a balance of this community is important for our health.
So what is the take-home message?
There is no doubt that washing our hands with liquid soap and water is effective in reducing the spread of infectious microorganisms, including those that are resistant to antimicrobial agents.
When you don’t have the opportunity to wash your hands after touching questionable surfaces, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Limit the touching of your hands to your mouth, nose and eyes.
Furthermore, maintain a healthy microbiota by limiting stress, getting enough sleep and “fertilizing” your gut microbes with a diversity of plant-based foods. It’s not only a small world, but a dirty one as well.

9 Surreal Thoughts About COVID-19 and What’s Coming Next,"

(CJ Opinion) — This gig is kinda weird at the moment. I write about what’s going on in the world for a living, and there’s certainly plenty going on in the world to be written about. But also there’s this acute awareness that anything I write about today is going to look petty and insignificant in the very near future.
I mean, we’re in the first moments of an unfolding pandemic which, from what I can tell just looking at the numbers, is about to change the world in some pretty significant ways. Governmental faceplant after governmental faceplant after missed opportunity after missed opportunity all around the world appears to have set us on a trajectory toward overburdened healthcare systems, severe economic downturns, and, of course, mass deaths.
And maybe chaos. And maybe healing. And maybe, when all is said and done, a total restructuring of power and the way we do things.
Standing on the precipice of that, how the hell am I supposed to write about how Bernie didn’t go hard enough at Biden in the last debate or whatever? So many of the arguments we’ve been placing so much importance on lately could easily look irrelevant in a matter of weeks.
Anyway, here are nine thoughts on COVID-19 and what’s coming.
My job is literally to monitor and compare global policy responses to coronavirus, and this is categorically untrue.Countries that are doing it better include: Sth Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, China (after the first month of lies and obfuscation), Austria and Australia https://t.co/4xpS7qodjL
— Ryan Heath (@PoliticoRyan) March 16, 2020

1 – Everyone in conspiracy circles has strong opinions about what’s going on, so anything I could possibly say about this is going to get a ton of pushback from some faction or another. That’s fine. In my opinion the fears that the ruling class will seize this opportunity to advance preexisting authoritarian agendas are well-founded, and people are right to have suspicions about the official narrative on the origins of the virus, but people who are still saying the whole thing is fake from top to bottom and it’s just another flu/no big deal have been proved wrong by facts in evidence. People should minimize social contact to avoid overburdening healthcare systems and thereby killing people. No matter how certain you are that this is all fake, you’re not certain enough to justify needlessly risking lives.
2 – Google-owned YouTube has just announced that they’re going to be censoring a lot more videos during the pandemic, citing the need to rely on automated censorship as they scale back workers’ presence at the office. No attempt has been made to explain why YouTube staff can’t just review the material working from home. Definitely worth keeping an eye on; if widespread authoritarian measures are going to be implemented during this time, increasing internet censorship will likely be the first step.
3 – I think this is going to hit America much harder than other countries, unfortunately. Combine a literal joke of a healthcare system with a president who up until just today has been dismissive of the threat the virus poses, the fact that the majority of Americans can’t afford a $1,000 emergency expense at a time of mounting layoffs while being chronically uninsured or underinsured, an inability to make anything happen without massive corporations voluntarily going against their own profit margins, a culture of rugged individualism with a reflexive distaste for collectivist organization for the good of the whole, and a highly religious population with many preachers telling their underinsured parishioners to demonstrate their faith by gathering at the megachurch and shaking hands with everyone, and you’ve got a recipe for disaster.
Please stay as safe as you can.

— Erik Solheim (@ErikSolheim) March 16, 2020

4 – Meanwhile China is having success getting the pandemic under control on its end, with its government’s ability to build hospitals and crank out brand new tech solutions with astonishing swiftness, and of course to clamp down on the public’s free movement as soon as it was deemed necessary. Now Beijing is moving into a world leadership position in tackling the pandemic, stepping in to aid nations which can’t get help elsewhere like Italy and Serbia.
5 – The US became a superpower after being left intact while competing nations were stuck rebuilding themselves from two devastating world wars, allowing it to surge ahead of the competition. China, as we’ve discussed here many times, has been poised to overtake America as the dominant world power, so it’s possible we’ll see China’s relative success and America’s relative failure on this front dance in a way which gives a significant boost in that direction in the same way the US was given a boost by the world wars. It’s very likely China comes out of this notably further along in its agenda to create a multipolar world than before this all began.
6 – And the US of course realizes this threat, which is why my social media notifications right now are full of propagandized human livestock bleating about China being the Latest Official Bad Guy who I absolutely must believe very bad things about. A dying empire knows it’s going to need to take some drastic, dangerous measures to secure world dominance in the face of a surging contender, and it knows it needs to manufacture consent for those drastic, dangerous measures. Anti-China propaganda has been pouring into mainstream consciousness with more and more aggression lately, first and foremost within right-wing echo chambers but also within mainstream liberal ones – Joe Biden compared the Chinese government to Jack the Ripper just last night.
The result has been rank-and-file westerners beginning to lose their minds about China, which has looked exactly like a right-wing mirror of the Russia hysteria we watched unfold throughout late 2016 and early 2017. I have been encountering far more hysterical anti-China sentiment online than I was even a week or two ago; a poll published at the beginning of this month reports US anti-China sentiment is at a 20-year high, and I’ll wager if they took it again today it would be significantly worse.
People are now constantly shrieking about how authoritarian the Chinese government is, which is stupid, because China has always had an authoritarian government. It hasn’t changed; the only thing that’s changed is the narrative management, with glaring adjustments like the mass media reporting on the Hong Kong protests vastly more than the anti-government demonstrations in US empire-aligned nations like France. All this irrelevant emphasis on where the virus originated isn’t there to protect you from the virus, it’s there to make China look bad. China is no more of a threat to you than it was two years ago; the only thing that’s changed is you’re now being hammered with narratives about how threatening it is. Mass media converging upon a single empire-targeted nation is never a good thing.

7 – It’s interesting how the virus which might knock down the most powerful government in the world behaves so much like that government: dominating world affairs and killing the most vulnerable members of the populations it attacks. Nations which are being smashed with US sanctions have already been watching their frail and elderly die of inadequate medical care and malnutrition, and now with the coronavirus they’re experiencing those same exact effects squared. Which is why places like Iran are being hit so uniquely hard. America is like if COVID-19 was a country.
8 – Also interesting is watching people react to the way so many of the corporate and government policies which have been causing ordinary human beings to suffer great pains are now simply being canceled all around the world in response to the pandemic. This Slate article documents a number of the changes which have been made just in America, like how for people being thrown in jail for minor offenses, “San Antonio is one of many jurisdictions to announce that, to keep jails from being crowded with sick citizens, they’ll stop doing that. Why were they doing it in the first place?” Or how “Trump has instructed government agencies who administer loans to waive interest accrual for the duration of the crisis. But why on earth is our government charging its own citizens interest anyway?”
We’re seeing immense burdens lifted from people with an easy “Oh, that’s making the pandemic worse? Okay we’ll stop that then.” And we’re seeing people react with fully justified indignation with, “Well why were you doing that to me in the first place??”
And the answer is very simple: because until now, your suffering wasn’t exacerbating a virus which does not discriminate on the basis of class. Politicians and billionaires are just as capable of losing their lives and loved ones to this virus as anyone else, as the CEO of Universal Music Group just learned with his COVID-19 hospitalization. Simply not causing needless human suffering wasn’t enough to get them to stop crushing people; it had to actually show up on their doorstep to make a difference.

9 – I have long thought that it would be awesome if the world could just take a nap for a minute. Capitalism is built around the glorification of busyness. We’re going to find out how many jobs we can do from home, how many jobs are only busywork, how many jobs we can comfortably consolidate or do without completely, and how many jobs are actually harmful. A big chunk of jobs have nothing to do with feeding, housing or caring for us, and everything to do with persuading people that they are deficient in some imaginary way and require this placebo tonic snake-oil to make us better again. Religion is one such job. Advertising, marketing, and most media are others. If we redesign the economy, we could do away with those altogether and have all that creative effort go toward healthy things.
Primarily though, we all need a big rest from constantly doing such soul-draining things. Having to do this while under the worry that we won’t be able to pay our rent and bills is not ideal, but do as my Mum always says — worry about the things you can change, and for the things you can’t change right now, leave them for the birds. Leave the bills for the birds for now. We will work out something; we always do. But for now, you are safe and you have everything you need. Notice that. Once you’ve established that you’re solid in this moment at least, take this time to really dig as deeply in to relaxation as you can. Watch some stand-up and get yourself laughing, sing to some YouTube karaokes, nap often and deeply, take showers and baths, really taste your food and enjoy your breath, yawn and stretch and cuddle and shake it all out. Forget about cleaning out the cupboards or learning that instrument or reading that book or whatever cute thing you decided you really should do now that you have the time — let your animal body lead the way, and give your brain a rest from all the shoulds and shouldn’ts. You’re fine just to do nothing at all. Sink in to that.

(TMU) — The Chinese government announced on Tuesday that it will lift the months-long lockdown on Central China’s Hubei Province, beginning Wednesday—two months after the region was plunged into complete isolation.
The provincial capital, Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged, will be excluded from the initial lifting of travel restriction as health authorities hope to make further gains in the fight against the pandemic.
Health officials believe that transportation out of Wuhan could be set to restart by April 8, Bloomberg reports.

Wuhan, a city of roughly 11 million residents, had been heavily hit by the virus before China adopted an unprecedented set of decisive and draconian measures on January 23 that effectively restricted the movements of 60 million people throughout Hubei province.
Beijing’s heavy-handed moves initially faced criticism in Western media but have since been hailed as crucial in helping to control the spread of the nightmarish novel virus.
The tactical efficiency of China’s tough measures have seemingly been borne out by the statistics, with Hubei reporting that new infections have dropped to zero on March 19—signaling a dramatic reversal of fortunes after the coronavirus rampaged through the East Asian country, infecting over 80,000 Chinese and killed over 3,200.

With those who have faced quarantine expected to return to domestic megacities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and others, authorities will likely shift the focus of prevention and containment toward addressing domestic relapses and cases imported from abroad.
Meanwhile in the United States, coronavirus cases continue to surge as hospitals and clinics run low on crucial medical supplies including, masks, gloves, goggles, and hospital gowns, while many Americans simultaneously remain skeptical about the gravity of the health crisis and the need for self-quarantining or social distancing.
Skeptics include U.S. President Donald Trump, who announced Tuesday, “America will be open for business very soon,” suggesting that social distancing guidelines could be lifted prior to Easter Day, April 12, in the interests of boosting the struggling economy of the U.S.
The president, who suggested last week that the CoViD-19 crisis could endure through the entire summer, also expressed his belief—unsupported by much of the medical community—that the U.S. would turn a corner in the fight against the pandemic “a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. … We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.”
Our people want to return to work. They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2020

So far, there have been at least 46,724 confirmed cases across the U.S.
The comments from Trump about reopening the country for business also coincide with comments from the World Health Organization (WHO) that the U.S. could soon become the new flashpoint for the global pandemic. WHO spokesperson Margaret Harris said:
“We are now seeing a very large acceleration in cases in the U.S. So it does have that potential [to become the centre of the pandemic].”

(TMU) — Human civilization has seemingly screeched to a halt for many, with those of us fortunate enough to have our good health hunkering down to read that Dostoevsky novel we’ve put off for many years, catch up on movies and streaming series, or endlessly scroll through our social media feeds.
However, our neighbors in the world of animals don’t seem to have received similar orders to self-quarantine or shelter in place. Across countries hit hard by the novel coronavirus—including Japan, Italy, and Thailand—wildlife has spilled into the eerily quiet city streets, creating almost Jumanji-like scenes of creatures roaming carelessly through concrete jungles.
Nara Park in Japan has long been a famous tourist destination due to its large population of gorgeous Sika deer, who are normally fed rice crackers by tourists eager to snap selfies with the beautiful deer, many of which have been trained to bow on command.
Bu since Japan’s government clamped down on foreign travel to the country while quarantining travelers from South Korea and China, over 1,000 deer inside the park have struggled to feed themselves. As a result, the deer have wandered beyond the boundaries of the park and into the city of Nara in hopes to feed themselves.
Photo and video of the deer roaming the streets, subway stations, and landscaped front yards of the city—sometimes in herds—have been posted across social media.

Japanese news outlet All-Nippon News Network or ANN even did a feature on the Nara Park deer invasion.

Meanwhile in Central Thailand, the large monkey population is also starving due to the lack of tourists, who once eagerly lined up to feed the little primates. The situation has grown so desperate that the little monkeys are engaging in fierce gang warfare in now-abandoned city plazas.

With an extremely stringent lockdown in effect across the country, the scenes of Mother Nature reoccupying urban spaces hasn’t been restricted to Venice alone. On various social media posts, animals including boars, ducks, sheep, and even horses can be seen meandering through Italy’s streets. The spectacle has caused no small amount of amusement among stir-crazy Italians sweating out the crisis from home.

(TMU) — As New York City becomes a major epicenter for the CoViD-19 outbreak in the United States, thousands of the city’s police officers are out sick from work.
At a press conference on Wednesday, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said that at least 236 members of the NYPD have tested positive for coronavirus and 3,200 additional officers have called out sick.
“We are backfilling patrols where we need to. We are taking on a variety of assignments,” Shae said, according to ABC News.
There are also 84 members of the New York City Fire Department who have tested positive for the virus.

Growing frustrations continue to increase among first responders over the lack of equipment during the coronavirus outbreak.
Posted by Fox News Video on Wednesday, March 25, 2020
People who are working in many industries in the United States currently do not have access to proper protective equipment even though they are still dealing with the public during this pandemic.
In many cases, this causes workers in these positions to become sick themselves and pass the illness on to the many people they come into contact with. This is especially true for healthcare workers and police.
Last week, Richard Prado tweeted a video showing multiple police and rescue workers in New York City dealing with a man who had suddenly collapsed on the subway after he “gasped for air loudly.”
Just got off the R train. A rider gasped for air loudly, and dropped to the floor. I immediately got off the next stop and begin filming.

It is not clear what the man’s current condition is, if he was infected with the coronavirus and if he was suffering from CoViD-19, but the crew that was working with him did not appear to be wearing protective gear.
Meanwhile, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that 300 non-violent, elderly inmates will be released from Riker’s Island Prison to help prevent the spread of a growing outbreak at the facility.
“We want to identify anyone in those categories and get them released immediately,” the mayor said, according to the Hill.
Only inmates who meet certain conditions will be released. These conditions include having serious pre-existing health conditions and less than one year remaining on their sentences. Inmates who were charged with sexual assault or domestic violence will not be eligible for release.

The World’s Fastest Supercomputer Has Been Tasked With Finding Cure,"

(TMU) — The world’s smartest and fastest supercomputer is just one tool in the arsenal of those racing to find a cure for COVID-19.
The Energy Department’s Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory is being used by researchers to comb through a database of more than 8,000 existing compounds to see which combinations might prevent cell infection of COVID-19.
The research is currently ongoing, but with the help of Summit scientists have already been able to perform simulations that resulted in outputs they believe will help pave the way for experimentation that can support researchers on their quest for a cure for the novel coronavirus.
Next Gov reports:
“Energy in 2014 partnered with IBM, NVIDIA and Mellanox in a contract worth hundreds of millions to produce the Summit supercomputer to enhance civilian-focused scientific research, and also the Sierra supercomputer, which was designed for nuclear weapons simulations and is located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. An Oak Ridge official confirmed Wednesday that Summit had not previously been used to address public health emergencies or virus outbreaks in the past.
But following the speedy outbreak of the new coronavirus strain, Smith found a relevant study recently published by Chinese scientists and realized he and his team “could take their work further,” with Summit’s help.”
To infect our cells, viruses bind to “spike” proteins (S-protein), injecting their genetic substance into host cells. However, if drug compounds bind to a the spike proteins on a virus they could potentially block it from infecting humans. Unfortunately, the process of effectively narrowing down the range of drugs that could work in blocking the virus is very slow. Beyond that, each variable holds millions to billions of unique pieces of data. To make that effort faster researchers are using a supercomputer.
“In any situation where time is a critical factor—for example, a health issue or a company trying to get a new product out to market—supercomputers can play a critical role through digital simulation. It would be prohibitively time-consuming for researchers to grow virus cultures and test them with the near infinite amount of molecular compounds that exist in the physical world,” IBM’s Vice President, Exascale Systems Dave Turek told Nextgov. “So supercomputers like Summit can speed up that process by digitally simulating the effect to narrow down the range of possibilities researchers can look into.”
In other words, to put the Summit supercomputer’s advanced capabilities into perspective, Turek expressed to Nextgov that “if every person on Earth completed one calculation per second, it would take 305 days to do what Summit can do in 1 second!”
The team found 77 small-molecule compounds, such as medications and natural compounds, that they suspect may be of value for experimental testing according to a press release announcement on the study.
Several researchers have already claimed to have a vaccine for COVID-19. However, whether or not they used research from Summit is unknown. In fact, CNBC reports that there are at least nine companies working on a vaccine or treatment for COVID-19. While some have sensationally claimed to have a vaccine already developed like Medicago and Inovio Pharmaceuticals, which is backed by the Bill Gates foundation.
An Israeli research lab has also claimed to have created a vaccine or is weeks away from doing so. However, the Defense Ministry later denied those claims. Australia has also made claims to have developed a vaccine which was alleged to have been produced by researchers at the University of Queensland. And Chinese scientists claim to have developed a vaccine as well, according to China’s ambassador in Russia Zhang Hanhui, as quoted by Interfax.
“The vaccine has already been developed in China; it shows the immunity [‘s capability to fight the virus]. But that’s just preliminary; one needs further checks and developments,” the diplomat said.
He also claimed that an effective medication against coronavirus was found.
“The practice shows that Chinese drugs are effective. There hasn’t been a single case of complication, as long as the medicine is taken. The overall effectiveness rate of Chinese medications exceeds 85 percent [of all cases], in some areas it exceeds 90,” the Chinese diplomat said.
Others like Serum Institute the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer by volume claims that a vaccine won’t be available until 2022, a whopping two years.
Meanwhile here in the U.S. health officials are claiming that testing for a coronavirus vaccine can begin within just six weeks. Which means there may be a potential promising breakthrough for a vaccine, but that doesn’t ensure safety. If all else fails there is still Summit to aid in the search for drugs that could help combat the highly infectious virus.

Study Shows People Can Transmit Coronavirus Without Showing Symptoms,"

(TMU) — In the two months since the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak began, numerous studies have been published about the virus. Unfortunately not all of the studies have been peer-reviewed and many of them contradict each other. Even the studies that are peer-reviewed have still been controversial, and it appears that different studies have rendered different results. However, numerous case studies of infected patients have shown that the outbreak may be even more challenging to contain than previously thought.
A case study published this week by Chinese researchers in the journal JAMA has shown that a 20-year-old woman from Wuhan passed the illness on to five of her family members but never became sick herself. To make matters even more confusing, the young woman initially tested negative for the illness before testing positive days later.
A report from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention last week suggested that around 1.2% of the officially confirmed cases in China showed no symptoms.
Meanwhile, over half of the people who tested positive on the Diamond Princess cruise ship were asymptomatic. On the cruise ship, 322 of the 621 people tested did not show any symptoms. This is leading many researchers to suggest that there are more asymptomatic cases than we realize, since the numbers counted in the Chinese CDC report did not include people who did not go through the hospitals.
In a briefing earlier this month, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases suggested that many of the asymptomatic cases were not being counted since they weren’t checking themselves into the hospital.
“It’s very clear that the people who are getting caught in that umbrella of reporting are the people that present themselves to a hospital. There’s another whole cohort that is either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic,” Fauci said.
Doctors believe that the woman from the recent case study had an incubation period of 19 days. Other studies have suggested that the time of incubation could be up to 24 or even 27 days. Due to the complicated nature of the illness and its symptoms, Harvard University epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch recently predicted that the illness would infect between 40% and 70% of the global population.

"As Panic Buying Spreads, Stores Roll Out Exclusive Shopping Hours for Elderly and Disabled","

(TMU) — As the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread across the globe, a number of supermarkets around the world have committed to hold dedicated shopping hours for elderly people and those with disabilities or compromised immune systems.
The move to offer special hours to the most vulnerable communities comes as panic buying due to spread of CoViD-19 has resulted in empty stores filled with shelves entirely stripped of products including toilet paper, dried pasta, canned tuna, and other shelf-stable items.
Stores reportedly offering the elderly-only shopping hour include the Woolworths retail chain in Australia; Altadena, California’s Grocery Outlet; Fields Foods in St. Louis, Missouri; Lunds & Byerlys in Minnesota; and branches of British retailer Iceland.
The stores are each offering an hour in the morning during which vulnerable shoppers will have exclusive access to the store, ensuring that they are able to stock up on essential groceries and other supplies without having to deal with large crowds of frightened, younger, able-bodied shoppers jostling and fighting for goods.
We’re launching a dedicated shopping hour in our stores to help support the needs of the elderly & people with disability in the community. From tomorrow until at least friday, we’ll be opening exclusively for them to shop from 7-8am, where permitted.
— Woolworths (@woolworths) March 15, 2020

In a statement, Woolworths Supermarkets Managing Director Claire Peters said:
“While we’ll continue to do our very best to restock our stores during this period of unprecedented demand, we know many of our elderly customers have been missing out on essential items when they shop.
This temporary measure will give them, and those with a disability, the opportunity to shop before ​our stores officially open, helping them obtain the ​essential ​items they need most in a less crowded environment.
We continue to encourage all Australians to be mindful of those in our communities who might need extra help at this time.”
British retailer Iceland also announced that some stores would open an hour early to allow elderly shoppers to stock up on essential products. While the move is not a company policy, the company told BBC that it would allow individual stores to open earlier if it suits the needs of local shoppers.
In a statement shared on the Facebook page of the Iceland store at The Kennedy Centre in Belfast, Northern Ireland, the retailer noted:
“Iceland Foods at Kennedy Centre will be opening their store between 8-9am for the elderly commencing Tuesday 17th March. 
Could the wider public please respect this hour, and understand that this time is allocated for elderly people only. Iceland appeal to people’s better nature when realising who needs priority.”
The statement, which has since been shared thousands of times online and received widespread positive feedback, has been hailed by shoppers concerned by how vulnerable communities have been impacted during the crisis resulting from the novel virus.
One commenter wrote:
“Well done Iceland for taking a stand. Well done for now trying a different approach to make sure those most vulnerable are able to get a chance to buy what they need.”

Medical authorities including the Centers for Disease Control have issued grave warnings that while the novel coronavirus can infect anyone, adults older than 60 and people with severe chronic illness are most likely to become seriously ill from CoViD-19.
Older adults who are over the age of 80 also face a severe threat from the spreading virus. According to a report published in medical journal JAMA, the overall fatality rate among roughly 72,000 Chinese coronavirus patients was 2.3 percent. However, among adults over 80, the fatality rate rose to 15 percent.

10 Vegetables You Can Easily Grow at Home All Year Round,"

(TMU) — As the coronavirus spreads across the United States, countless families are preparing to hunker down for what could be an indefinite amount of time. Whether it’s because of orders to “shelter-in-place,” self-quarantine, or simply our own conscience telling us it’s the right thing to do for the public good, many of us are preparing for a long stay at home.
With store shelves being stripped bare by panicked shoppers and many of our work hours—if not our entire jobs—being cut back due to the crisis, food security has suddenly become an issue, not only for our households but for our communities as well.
Because of this, home gardening could likely make a big comeback. Just as past generations of Americans responded to World Wars I & II with “victory gardens” at home, current generations could be set to revive the practice of planting, harvesting, and eating our own food. If anything, CoViD-19 could help us become reacquainted with some better habits when it comes to not just hygiene but general nutrition and self-sufficiency.
Here are just a few plants that can easily be grown in a small apartment or home.
Whether you’re living in a sprawling condo or a tiny studio apartment, growing and harvesting herbs is supremely easy. Foodies who aren’t keen on blowing their hard-earned dollars on spices at Whole Foods can easily grow little pots of basil, mint, ginger, cilantro, parsley, or rosemary at home. All you need is a nice sunny spot on your window sill or fire escape and a bit of regular watering, and you’ll soon have fresh herbs in every meal!
Don’t let the price-tag fool you! While kale may be a trendy item at health food stores and restaurants, the plant is surprisingly easy to grow indoors—even during the colder months!
However, of key importance is to sow the seeds a bit farther apart than normal to allow the kale plants adequate room for growth. Within a week, you’ll soon see your kale sprouting! And then it’s only a matter of time before you’re baking kale chips, drinking kale smoothies, and enjoying a healthy kale salad!
Carrots can be a super fun vegetable for beginners to grow indoors because anyone can help keep a steady level of moisture in the soil, it’s not too hard!  Carrots also come in a dazzling array of different types—from the common Imperator to the dozens of varieties of the reddish, crunchy Nantes—that can all be grown indoors and aren’t always easily found at local markets.
All you’ll need is a 12-inch pot, soil, and a sunny window, and you’re all set to be on your way to harvesting some nutritious and tasty carrots!
Growing bell peppers indoors can help one gain proper control of the growing environment, which in turn produces stunning peppers. Bell peppers also have a nice and long indoor growing season, which means a much larger yield spanning longer periods of time.
Mushrooms are one of nature’s gifts to our pantry, mainly because the low-calorie fungi are very healthy as well as tasty, high in fiber, and chock full of healthy potassium.
Growing them at home is extremely easy and because they grow in dark, moist environments, they can be grown by anyone just about anywhere. It takes about 4.5 weeks to grow mushies from start to plate, and there are few things as fun as picking the little guys and eating them in the same day.
Beets are a brilliantly colorful addition to any plate, but they also pack a strong nutritional power-punch of vitamins and minerals. The root vegetable is perfect for beginning gardeners because they are so easy to grow indoors, and a beginning chef would do well to experiment with beet dishes—be it a satisfying Russian borscht soup or some nice beet pickles.
Growing potatoes is one of the easiest things you could do, whether you are growing them in a large basket, a big bucket, or even in a plastic sack. But when you’re growing them, leave some empty space at the top so you can dump some fresh compost in and help the root veggie develop.
Micro greens are delicious super-foods, tiny green plants that are packed with flavor and normally cost an arm and a leg at the local supermarket. But they’re also very easy to grow at home with a few basic supplies, a bit of sunlight, and a small container. It takes only 2 to 3 short weeks from planting to harvesting before you can have a plateful of healthy micro greens.
Onions are awesome to grow indoors in decorative pots or water dishes because not only do they not take up much space or require direct sunlight, but they naturally re-sprout. What this means is that you can grow new onions from seeds, or you can take your old onion scraps and sprout new onions, ensuring that your kitchen never goes without fresh bulbs.
Like onions, garlic is a re-sprouting plant that can be harvested year-round to ensure that you always have the tasty plant in your kitchen. You can also trim the shoots of the garlic bulb to use in soups, pizzas, or as a delicious garnish! Just get some good garlic from a nursery or online, break up the bulbs, and plant your biggest cloves. Soon you’ll see the green shoots of the plant, which are also edible, and after 10 months you’ll have some delicious homegrown garlic!

The statement also noted that Ma’s foundation donated supplies to other afflicted areas in Japan, Korea, Italy, Iran, and Spain.
“The crisis presents a huge challenge to all humankind in a globalized world. The pandemic we face today can no longer be resolved by any individual country. Rather, we need to combat the virus by working hand-in-hand. At this moment, we can’t beat this virus unless we eliminate boundaries to resources and share our know-how and hard-earned lessons,” Ma said in the statement.
However, it is not entirely clear who exactly these supplies will be sent to or how they will be distributed.
In January, as outbreaks of the illness were exploding across China, Ma donated $14.5 million towards a coronavirus vaccine and has promised to continue helping with the response to the pandemic.
The official number of cases in the U.S. is just over 4,600, but some experts and health officials believe that there are already hundreds of thousands of cases. Dr. Marty Makary, a medical professor at Johns Hopkins University, estimates that there could be up to a half-million cases in the U.S.

(TMU) — Iran now has the largest number of coronavirus related deaths outside of China but still has a relatively low number of confirmed cases when compared with other areas that have been hit hard by the virus.
Thus far, 26 deaths have been reported in the country but there are only 245 confirmed cases. It is likely that the virus is more widespread in Iran, but few people are being tested.
As politicians and health officials in the country have assured the public that the situation is under control, they are falling ill with the virus themselves.
In fact, Iran’s deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, tested positive for COVID-19 just hours after he appeared on television coughing, blowing his nose, and heavily sweating, insisting that the government had the outbreak under control.

Less than a day after his diagnosis, state media reported that Masoumeh Ebtekar, Iranian Vice-President for women and family affairs, was also infected with the virus. Before she tested positive for the illness, Ebtekar was also criticizing media for reporting on the outbreak.

In total, seven high ranking officials in the Iranian government have tested positive for the virus.
Meanwhile, Iranian legislator Ahmad Amirabadi Farahani claimed in a news interview that the government is covering up the severity of the outbreak, and that there are over 50 people who have now died of the virus in the country. Elham Sheikhi, a professional athlete in her 20s and member of the women’s national soccer team, is among the country’s coronavirus casualties.
Iran canceled Friday prayers in Tehran and has advised citizens to avoid crowded areas or any unnecessary trips.
Officials in Italy, the area worst hit by the virus outside of China, have been getting sick as well. In Lombardy, the region at the epicenter of Italy’s outbreak, governor Attilio Fontana, has placed himself in quarantine after one of his staff members became infected. Just like officials in Iran, Fontana assured the public that everything was under control before getting sick himself.
""I am ready to protect everyone from Lombardy and anyone who comes into contact with me.”

(CONVERSATION) — The new coronavirus, 2019 n-CoV, continues to spread in China, and cases are being diagnosed in many other countries, including the U.S.
With initial symptoms that resemble other diseases, many people are wondering how to know whether to seek medical help.
The biggest risk factors for being infected with the new coronavirus are travel to China, particularly Wuhan and other areas of Hubei Province, and close contact with a person who has a suspected or confirmed n-CoV case. Without those risk factors, the chance for the general American public of catching this virus is low.
However, the outbreak is rapidly changing, and it is unclear how the situation in the U.S. will evolve in upcoming weeks.
Most cases of 2019 n-CoV have had fever and signs of pneumonia, like cough or shortness of breath. In some cases people are not able to breathe on their own and require the use of a ventilator. A small percentage of people die.
If you experience any of these symptoms within 14 days of travel to China, or within 14 days of coming in close contact with an individual infected with the coronavirus, you should immediately call your health care provider. It is best to call ahead before going to a clinic or emergency room.
Your health care provider will evaluate you with the help of your state’s public health department and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If your travel history and reported symptoms fit with n-CoV infection, you may be tested for the virus. Right now that test can be performed only at the CDC, so your health care provider would send samples to the CDC for testing.
At this time of year many respiratory viruses are circulating in the community, including influenza, RSV, rhinovirus and human coronaviruses, which are different from the 2019 n-CoV virus. It is much more likely that you have one of these viruses than the 2019 n-CoV virus, even if you have traveled to China.
Yes. There are four human coronaviruses that circulate each year in the U.S. They cause 10% to 30% of upper respiratory tract illnesses in the U.S., with mild symptoms akin to the common cold. Health care labs can test for these coronaviruses – but not for 2019 n-CoV.

"Chinese Market at Center of Coronavirus Outbreak Sold Live Koalas, Snakes, Rats and Wolf Puppies","

(TMU) — As China continues to take extraordinary measures to contain the deadly coronavirus outbreak, “wet markets”—outdoor food markets selling both live and dead animals—have been labeled “ground zero” by authorities in regard to the viral epidemic.
The market facing the most scrutiny allegedly sells the meat of over 100 animals including exotic snakes, live rats, wolf puppies, live peacocks, porcupines, and even koalas, according to images circulating online.
🖐🏼I volunteer to translate Public Livestock Wild Game menu items and prices:

— CIAspy 🌀 (@CIAspy) January 22, 2020

On Wednesday, state authorities banned the trade of live animals at wet markets. The popular Huanan Seafood Market in the central city of Wuhan where the virus is believed to have begun was previously closed on January 1.
Dr. Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese agency charged with controlling and preventing diseases, confirmed that the virus—now known as the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)—likely came from “wild animals at the seafood market” but did not go into specifics. The first to suffer from the virus were reportedly the employees at the Wuhan market.
The vast outdoor marketplace is comprised of rows and rows of narrow lanes cluttered with shopkeepers, butchers, and consumers looking for the freshest cuts of uncooked meat. As Business Insider reports, people and animals—both alive and dead—are in constant contact at the market, making it far easier for the virus to spill over from animal hosts into the human population.
Relatively common animals include pigs, hares, chicken, shrimp, and dogs, but an incredible array of exotic cuts can be found including giant salamanders, crocodile tongue, and civets. Chinese consumption of civet meat was the cause of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003, according to AFP. The SARS virus, which originated with bats, was found across wildlife markets in China.

One menu advertising a Wuhan market vendor boasts:
“Freshly slaughtered, frozen and delivered to your door. Wild Game Animal Husbandry for the Masses.”
While Chinese authorities have outlawed the trafficking of numerous wild species—especially since the outbreak of SARS—conservationists claim that the regulations are too loose in general but especially for species that are farmed for commercial purposes.
Exotic species are famously seen as delicacies across China and other Asian countries largely due to the legendary and often unproven medicinal benefits of eating the wild creatures. The consumption of exotic and even live animals is also seen as a symbol of social status.

However, revelations of the live animal sales have even shocked many locals.
One user of Chinese social network Weibo wrote:
“Just took a closer look at the viral wild animal menu – they even eat koalas.”
While another user responded:
“There’s nothing Chinese people won’t eat.”
In a statement made on Wednesday, Dr. Christian Walzer, executive director of the U.S.-based Wildlife Conservation Society’s Health Program, said:
“Chinese scientists believe the Wuhan Coronavirus originated in wildlife sold illegally in a live animal market. This virus is closely related to SARS and it now appears the spill-over to humans followed a similar transmission path. China closed Wuhan markets where this new virus was tracked back to – but similar markets occur in other cities across China and other Asian countries. 
If these markets persist, and human consumption of illegal and unregulated wildlife persists, then the public will continue to face heightened risks from emerging new viruses, potentially more lethal and the source of future pandemic spread.
Poorly regulated live animal markets, where wild animals, farmed-wildlife, and domestic animals are transported from across the regions and housed together to sell for human consumption provide ideal conditions for the emergence of new viruses that threaten human health, economic stability, and ecosystem health.”
Beijing is struggling to keep the coronavirus under control, imposing a quarantine on three cities after the virus killed 17 people and infected nearly 640.
Meanwhile, experts have warned it is “quite possible” that the deadly virus will spread to Australia.
“We do have a lot of traffic from China and I think it’s quite possible we will get some cases here but I’m very ­confident that we’re well ­prepared to respond if we do,” Australia’s Chief Medical Officer ­Brendan Murphy said.
Just moments ago, health authorities in Australia confirmed that a person in Sydney is under quarantine after possibly contracting the deadly coronavirus.

(TMU) — Italy is in mourning after a young nurse working in an intensive care unit dealing with the nightmarish coronavirus pandemic took her own life after she contracted the disease, a nursing federation confirmed.
Daniela Trezzi, 34, had been dealing with intense stress due to her frontline work in the European epicenter of the novel virus. However, when she contracted the disease on March 10, she became preoccupied with the possibility that she had already spread the virus to her colleagues at the San Gerardo Hospital in the city of Monza, which is located in the hard-hit Lombardy region.
An Italian nurse killed herself after testing positive for coronavirus and fearing she had infected others, a nursing federation has revealed.

On Tuesday, the National Federation of Nurses of Italy (Federazione Nazionale Ordini Professioni Infermieritich) announced that Trezzi had taken her own life this past Sunday. Trezzi had reportedly informed a colleague that she was scared and concerned that she had infected somebody with the virus, Pulzo reports.
In a press statement, the federation said:
“We express our pain and consternation over the suicide of our young colleague. Our 450,000 professionals will join together around the relatives and family of Daniela.”
San Gerardo Hospital Director Mario Aparone also expressed his regret over Trezzi’s death, noting that the relevant authorities would investigate the case.
Tragically, the National Federation of Nurses revealed that this wasn’t the first such case of a nurse taking their own life as a similar incident had happened mere days ago in Venice. The federation said:
“We are at risk of suffering these stressful conditions and a shortage of medical personnel, but this cannot be commented on now.”

According to the most recent data from Italian health authorities, the country now has at least 69,176 cases of coronavirus and 6,820 deaths—close to double the amount of fatalities registered in China where the novel virus first emerged last December. However, the Italian Civil Protection Agency, which is charged with collating the data, believes that the infections could be as high as 700,000. Agency chief Angelo Borrelli told La Repubblica newspaper that “a ratio of one certified case out of every 10 is credible.”
The Northern Italian region of Lombardy has borne the brunt of the pandemic, with the death toll rising by roughly 296 in a single day to at least 4,474 on Wednesday, Reuters reports.
Amid the crisis, medics have been saddled with the gut-wrenching responsibility of choosing which patients live or die due to the lack of ventilators and hospital beds. Meanwhile, at least 18 doctors have succumbed to CoViD-19 in Italy alone.
Since the outbreak of the novel virus, aid and medical experts have also poured into Northern Italy from China, Cuba, Russia, and the United States in a sort of geopolitical tug-of-war over who can provide the most aid to the struggling Mediterranean nation.

"Jeff Bezos, World’s Richest Man, Wants Your Donations To Help Amazon Employees","

(MPN Opinion) – Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the world’s first centibillionaire, a man who vies with Bill Gates for the title of the planet’s richest individual, is asking the public for donations to provide basic support to his 800,000 employees who are suffering in poverty in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Bezos announced:
“We are establishing the Amazon Relief Fund with a $25 million initial contribution focused on supporting our independent delivery service partners and their drivers, Amazon Flex participants, and seasonal employees under financial distress during this challenging time.”
The fund will also support both employees and contractors around the world that face economic hardship due to natural disasters or unforeseen personal circumstances. Those who qualify can apply for a grant of up to $5,000.
“I’ve never been more proud of our teams around the world. People are supporting one another, taking care of themselves and others while also doing what we do best, which is serving customers,” said Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of Human Resources at Amazon.
Amazon set up a relief fund for its employees and is asking us to donate.
Amazon is worth nearly $1 trillion.
Amazon paid a negative federal income tax rate in 2018. They paid nothing but got millions in government subsidies.
How is this real. https://t.co/MiLArAnTdA

A man worth over $100 billion, who makes, on average, $230,000 per minute calling on the public to help his own impoverished employees was not met well by many. Amazon itself is worth over $1 trillion, and some felt Bezos himself was in a better position than others, especially members of the public also economically hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, to help his own staff. Furthermore, the company is notorious as a bad employer. Forced to forego bathroom breaks, many company warehouse workers are effectively compelled to wear diapers during their shifts. Other employees report working in unsafe environments and being punished for injuries sustained on the job. The company also does not provide its employees with regular access to clean water.
Amazon workers are poor. Really poor. In Arizona, for example, the company’s own data suggests that one in three employees depend upon food stamps to put food on the table. It is the twenty-eighth largest employer in the state. However, it ranked fifth on the list for most employees enrolled in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP). Across the United States, it is a similar story. In Pennsylvania, for instance, Amazon is the nineteenth largest employer but is in fifth place on the SNAP employees list of corporations. And amidst the deadly COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the globe, the job is one of the more dangerous around, as workers are constantly on the move, handling a great number of packages and in close proximity to others. Despite its poor pay, the job is considered essential to the upkeep of society.
I can’t even process this…
Amazon — you know, the one run by the richest man, the one whose sales have shot up during a pandemic — is doing an online fundraiser. Asking all of us to donate to support its warehouse temps & flex drivers hit by Covid.

Bezos’ charitable donations often garner him considerable praise in the media. His donation of one million Australian dollars to aid the bushfires in January generated headlines proclaiming his generosity. But as MintPress reported, that was equivalent to just three minutes’ income, as generous as a person making $20,000 per year donating a dime. Linsey McGoey, Professor of Sociology at the University of Essex, UK, told MintPress that, “philanthropy can and is being used deliberately to divert attention away from different forms of economic exploitation that underpin global inequality today.”
In other news, Amazon employees in Chicago announced yesterday that, through collective action, they had forced the company to agree to paid time off for all U.S. warehouse workers, something that will be especially useful in the current circumstances. “Almost a year ago, in the summer of 2019, a small crew of us got fed up with Amazon’s bullshit and met up outside of work because we felt we had to do something,” they said, proclaiming victory.
In the U.S., the company is currently increasing recruitment to deal with a sharp surge in sales. On the other hand, the government of France has suspended all non-essential Amazon deliveries in a bid to cut down on contagion rates. The company has also been forced to halt price gouging on its website of key products like hand sanitizer.
While Bezos asks for donations, he appears to genuinely not have considered using his own wealth to help those in need. In 2018 he lamented that “the only way that I can see to deploy this much financial resource is by converting my Amazon winnings into space travel. That is basically it.” His employees might have other ideas about how he could use his fortune.

"Tokyo May Be Forced to Cancel Olympic Games If Outbreak Not Contained by May, Official Says","

Reddit







Email



(TMU) — As East Asian countries continue to struggle with the spreading novel coronavirus, a senior member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has warned that the Tokyo Olympic Games may be cancelled if authorities fail to contain its spread within the next two to three months.
Long-standing IOC member Dick Pound told the Associated Press on Tuesday that if fears aren’t calmed by around May, organizers would have no choice but to cancel the games, rather than postpone or move them. The former Canadian swimming champion who has been on the top committee told AP:
“In and around that time, I’d say folks are going to have to ask: ‘Is this under sufficient control that we can be confident about going to Tokyo or not?’” 
And as the opening ceremony for the games approaches fast, he said, “a lot of things have to start happening. You’ve got to start ramping up your security, your food, the Olympic Village, the hotels. The media folks will be in there building their studios.”
Since the viral outbreak began in China two months ago, over 80,000 people have been infected worldwide, with 2,700 dying—mostly in China. However, NHK World reports that as of Tuesday, 861 people in Japan are confirmed to be infected. Japan has reported four deaths so far.
On Wednesday, Japan’s J. League decided to postpone all domestic soccer matches up to the first half of March, reports Reuters.
The summer Olympic Games, which are set to kick off on July 24, will bring about 11,000 athletes to Tokyo. Another 4,400 athletes will arrive in the Japanese capital for the Paralympics, which are due to begin August 25.
Since its inception in 1896, the modern Olympic Games have only been cancelled during wartime. In 1940, the Olympics were supposed to occur in Tokyo but were cancelled due to Japan’s aggressive war on China during World War II.
The final decision as to whether the Olympics can proceed this year remains contingent on discussions with the World Health Organization, Pound stressed.
Pound explained:
“All indications are at this stage that it will be business as usual. So keep focused on your sport and be sure that the IOC is not going to send you into a pandemic situation.
It’s a big, big, big decision and you just can’t take it until you have reliable facts on which to base it.”
Pound conceded that postponing or moving such a massive event as the Olympics remains logistically impossible. So far, Japan has officially spent $12.6 billion to organize the sports competition—although a national audit board claims authorities have spent roughly twice the official amount.
Pound continued:
“You just don’t postpone something on the size and scale of the Olympics.
There’s so many moving parts, so many countries and different seasons, and competitive seasons, and television seasons. You can’t just say, we’ll do it in October.”

Two Asteroids Most Likely Won’t Cause Tiny Atmospheric Explosion Over Earth,"



Facebook

Email



UPDATE: Lead Stories has rated this article false because “NASA did not warn two asteroids could cause atmospheric explosion over earth this week.”
(TMU) — As if 2020 weren’t overwhelming enough, in addition to the potential start of World War 3, the massive fires in Australia, the locust plague in the Middle East and Africa, and the novel coronavirus, we are now dealing with multiple asteroids hurtling towards Earth. One of the asteroids may even collide with Earth’s atmosphere resulting in an atmospheric explosion tonight!
Two asteroids following Earth’s intersecting orbit known as 2020 EF and 2020 DP4 are approaching the planet, and information collected by NASA indicates the space rocks are big enough to create violent explosions in the atmosphere if they come too close to the Earth.
The asteroids are being closely monitored by NASA’s Center for Near-Earth Object Studies (CNEOS).
According to a report by IB Times, CNEOS estimates the 2020 EF asteroid has a diameter of 98 feet, making it a little longer than the distance between baseball diamond bases, with a velocity of 10,000 mph.
CNEOS sates that 2020 EF is what is known as an Aten asteroid, which means the object follows a normal orbit that crosses Earth’s path. NASA’s orbit diagram for 2020 EF shows the asteroid mimics a very wide orbit around the sun and almost follows the exact same path as Earth. The good news is NASA states in their diagram that the asteroid will have multiple near-approaches between 2020 EF and our planet—but it won’t hit us.
According to NASA, as a result of their size, 2020 EF will most likely not cause an impact event. Instead, it will break up into pieces if it enters Earth’s atmosphere. However, it could still cause a tiny explosion in the sky.
The last asteroid atmospheric explosion took place over the city of Chelyabinsk, Russia, which produced a flash 30 times brighter than the Sun and caused 180 cases of eye pain and 70 cases of temporary flash blindness.
So make sure you don’t stare at it with the naked eye, similar to how you shouldn’t stare directly at the sun, no matter how curious you may be.
2020 DP4 is coming our way and will cause a similar space spectacle this week on March 22nd at 2:36 p.m EST. Compared to 2020 EF, 2020 DP4 is much larger in diameter at 180 feet wide and traveling at a faster velocity rate at 18,000 mph according to CNEOS.
While 2020 EF is classified as an Aten asteroid, 2020 DP4 on the other hand belongs to the Apollo family of space rocks. Although the two asteroids are labeled differently, they are known to intersect Earth’s orbit as the planet makes its way around the Sun.
CNEOS states 2020 EF is expected to fly past the Earth from a distance of 0.04241 astronomical units or approximately 4 million miles. Meanwhile, 2020 DP4 will approach Earth from a much closer distance which according to CNEOS, is only 0.00901 astronomical units or around 840,000 miles.
While NASA has expressed that both asteroids won’t collide with the Earth, last year NASA and the U.S. government’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) participated in an exercise with other international partners to deal with asteroids that could be a future impact danger. Last year, NASA also awarded SpaceX a $69 million contract to redirect an asteroid off its intended path under the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) program, which uses a technique known as a kinetic impactor. The mission involves sending one or more SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets into the path of an approaching near-earth object, in this case, Didymos’ small moon in October 2022.
The European Space Agency (ESA) is also involved in that joint mission to slam a probe into the asteroid Didymos’ small moon.
Next month a third asteroid is expected to come close to Earth called 52768 (1998 OR2). First spotted in 1998, the space rock much bigger than 2020 FE and 2020 DP4, at 1.1 – 2.5 miles wide, is expected to pass within around 4 million miles—or about 17 times the distance from Earth to the Moon, moving at a velocity of 19,461 miles per hour. CNEOS states that the third asteroid will fly by the Earth on April 29, at 4:56 a.m. EST.
According to CNN, NASA also reassures that 52768 (1998 OR2) will not hit the Earth despite worries with its classification as “potentially hazardous.” However, the asteroid is “large enough to cause global effects,” according to NASA.
The next potential asteroid that could cause significant damage if it hit Earth is expected to fly through our solar system and pass near Earth on April 13, 2029. The giant icy space rock—known as 99942 Apophis, for the Egyptian God of Chaos—is 1,100 feet wide (340 meters) and will speed by at over 67,000 miles per hour. According to NASA, Apophis has a 2.7% chance to hit Earth—a very low probability.
Thankfully we shouldn’t expect an Deep Impact scenario any time soon.

Ireland’s Largest Sports Stadium Transformed Into Coronavirus Drive-Thru Testing Site,"

(TMU) — Ireland’s health service has announced that it will transform the country’s biggest sports stadium into a massive drive-thru coronavirus testing site.
Testing at the 80,000 capacity Croke Park Stadium began on Tuesday on an appointment-only basis, AFP reported Wednesday.
On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Health Service Executive said:
“Croke Park is one of the designated testing centers for north Dublin.” 
With its massive football pitch and location in central Dublin, Croke Park is home to and headquarters of Gaelic football and the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA).

Given that no matches will be played at the Dublin venue any time in the near future, the GAA offered the national stadium as a site for drive-thru testing. Once the site is fully operational, it is expected that it will handle an average of eight cars every 15 minutes for seven days a week and 12 hours per day.
On Wednesday, the Department of Health announced that 74 new cases of CoViD-19 had been confirmed in the country, bringing the total number of infections in Ireland to 366, Joe reported. In Dublin alone, there are 129 confirmed cases.
Irish pubs, schools, and universities will be closed until March 29, but it is quite likely that that the closures will last much longer than initially announced.

Gatherings of over 100 people have also been restricted as the government has stressed the need for “social distancing” measures, including working from home.
In a dire warning delivered Tuesday during a St. Patrick’s Day address, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar warned there could 15,000 cases of coronavirus in Ireland by month’s end, and the duration of the crisis could stretch well into the summer.
In the emotional speech, Varadkar said:
“This is a Saint Patrick’s Day like no other.
A day that none of us will ever forget.
Today’s children will tell their own children and grandchildren about the national holiday in 2020 that had no parades or parties, but instead saw everyone staying at home to protect each other.
In years to come, let them say of us, when things were at their worst, we were at our best.”
Continuing, he warned of the enormous stresses likely to be placed on health professionals, noting:
“This is the calm before the storm—before the surge.
And when it comes—and it will come—never will so many ask so much of so few.”

Biolab for “Most Dangerous Pathogens on Earth” Opened in Wuhan Before Outbreak,"

(TMU) — As of Thursday afternoon, 23 million people in seven Chinese cities have been placed on quarantine due to the sudden outbreak of a deadly SARS-like virus called 2019-nCoV.

The illness is said to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan and quickly spread to other areas of China, then Japan, Thailand, South Korea, and the United States. Suspected cases have been reported in Australia and Scotland. However, it is possible that there is more to the story as Chinese authorities have been running a censorship campaign to prevent the spread of information about the virus that deviates from official statements.
Another thing #Chinaisgoodat Wuhan police said on January 1 that it had summoned eight people who spread “rumors” about the coronavirus situation for questioning and punishment. Says a quib,”The virus is not a social media post so can’t just be deleted.” Where are the 8 people? https://t.co/OBqNNhZBLH pic.twitter.com/o3g6hWGWUm
— Li Yuan (@LiYuan6) January 21, 2020

One very strange coincidence in the development of this outbreak is the fact that a new biolab, tasked with studying the most dangerous pathogens on earth, recently began operating in Wuhan—where the illness is said to have originated.
Back in 2017, just before experiments at the lab began, the prestigious science journal Nature published an article expressing concerns about pathogens escaping from the new Wuhan lab. The laboratory is a biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) facility, which is the highest level of biocontainment. BSL-4 facilities must meet rigid standards for decontaminating the area as well as workers after every experiment. However, BSL-4 labs remain extremely controversial because critics argue that these measures may not be enough to prevent a virus from escaping.
According to Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey, the SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times.
In May of 2019, less than a year before the outbreak began, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a press release that gave an overview of the projects that the new lab was currently working on. The projects included SARS, Ebola, Hemorrhagic fever, Lassa fever, avian influenza A(H5N1), Rift Valley fever, and others.
Scientists have examined the genetic code of the new virus and have found that it is more closely related to SARS than any other human coronavirus. In BSL-4 labs, researchers can tweak or combine deadly viruses to create mutated strains of the original illness. A 2013 report in Nature indicated that scientists in China were creating hybrid viruses in labs.
“A team of scientists in China has created hybrid viruses by mixing genes from H5N1 and the H1N1 strain behind the 2009 swine flu pandemic, and showed that some of the hybrids can spread through the air between guinea pigs,” the article revealed.
The results of the hybrid virus experiment were published in the journal Science.
Such experiments are usually intended to teach scientists more about certain illnesses so they can be treated and prevented better, but other research has involved intentionally making certain viruses even more deadly than they already were. Regardless of the motivation, exposing people to these pathogens, even in the most secure of settings, can be risky especially considering the fact that contagions have escaped from secure labs in the past.

"The Entire Healthcare System in the US is About to Collapse, Doctors and Nurses Warn","

(CD) — Health professionals are increasingly sounding the alarm over the U.S. healthcare system, warning that the coronavirus outbreak will quickly overwhelm unprepared hospitals without swift action to provide equipment to nurses and doctors.
“This is a nationwide problem, even on the private side,” an anonymous doctor told NBC News. “No clinic in this country, or hospital for that matter, is going to have enough equipment.”
NBC News reported that around 250 doctors and nurses responded to an informal survey request and painted a bleak picture of a healthcare system already on the verge of collapse with at least a month to go before coronavirus cases peak in the U.S.—citing in particular a lack of personal protective equipment (PPE).
According to NBC News:
Nearly all who responded said there were shortages of PPE in the hospitals, outpatient clinics and offices where they worked.
Many reported being forced to ration or reuse supplies, including surgical and N95 masks, for fear of running out. Many also said they were facing shortages of basic sanitary supplies, including hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.
One Philadelphia doctor interviewed by NBC News said her husband—also a doctor—is on the frontlines in the city.
“I am so scared,” she said. “I can’t even begin to tell you.”
Calls for the federal government to step in and order manufacturers to produce equipment increased Friday, with the union National Nurses United issuing a demand for immediate action to protect healthcare workers.
“We need to act now and act fast,” Bonnie Castillo, National Nurses United executive director, said in a statement. “Priority number one is to protect the health and safety of our nurses and health care workers so that they can continue to take care of patients and keep our communities as healthy as possible through this pandemic. If our health facilities no longer stay as centers of healing and instead turn into disease vectors, many more people will needlessly suffer from this terrible disease.”
It’s not just PPE. Testing kits are near-impossible to obtain for hospitals and health professionals, leading to difficult decisions on who to treat, when to treat them, and how to track the virus. In Los Angeles County, health officials are instructing doctors and nurses “to test patients only if a positive result could change how they would be treated.”
As the Los Angeles Times reported:
A front-line healthcare provider who was not authorized to speak to the media and requested anonymity said county doctors are interpreting Thursday’s letter and other advice coming from senior L.A. County public health officials to mean they should only test patients who are going to be hospitalized or have something unique about the way they contracted the virus.
The coming crisis, as one nurse in Michigan told NBC News, is the result of a societal failure to prioritize public health.
“I don’t feel like my hospital is failing us,” said the nurse. “It’s the whole system that’s failing us.”

“How Do I Pay for This?”: Shocking Cost of Coronavirus Testing is Bad for Everyone,"

(CD) — Public health advocates, experts, and others are demanding that the federal government cover coronavirus testing and all related costs after several reports detailed how Americans in recent weeks have been saddled with exorbitant bills following medical evaluations.
Sarah Kliff of the New York Times reported Saturday that Pennsylvania native Frank Wucinski “found a pile of medical bills” totaling $3,918 waiting for him and his three-year-old daughter after they were released from government-mandated quarantine at Marine Corps Air Station in Miramar, California.
“My question is why are we being charged for these stays, if they were mandatory and we had no choice in the matter?” asked Wucinski, who was evacuated by the U.S. government last month from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
“I assumed it was all being paid for,” Wucinski told the Times. “We didn’t have a choice. When the bills showed up, it was just a pit in my stomach, like, ‘How do I pay for this?'”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is not billing patients for coronavirus testing, according to Business Insider. “But there are other charges you might have to pay, depending on your insurance plan, or lack thereof,” Business Insider noted. “A hospital stay in itself could be costly and you would likely have to pay for tests for other viruses or conditions.”
Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, told the Times that “the most important rule of public health is to gain the cooperation of the population.”
“There are legal, moral, and public health reasons not to charge the patients,” Gostin said.
Congress needs to immediately pass a bill appropriating funding to cover 100% of the cost of all coronavirus testing & care within the United States. We will not have a chance at containing it otherwise.@tedlieu – as my rep, can you please ensure this is brought up?
— William LeGate 🧢 (@williamlegate) March 2, 2020

In the case of the Wucinskis, Kliff reported that “the ambulance company that transported [them] charged the family $2,598 for taking them to the hospital.”
“An additional $90 in charges came from radiologists who read the patients’ X-ray scans and do not work for the hospital,” Kliff noted.
The CDC declined to respond when Kliff asked whether the federal government would cover the costs for patients like the Wucinskis.
The Intercept‘s Robert Mackey wrote last Friday that the Wucinskis’ situation spotlights “how the American government’s response to a public health emergency, like trying to contain a potential coronavirus epidemic, could be handicapped by relying on a system built around private hospitals and for-profit health insurance providers.”
We should be doing everything we can to encourage people with #COVIDー19 symptoms to come forward. Huge surprise medical bills is going to make sure people with symptoms don’t get tested. That is bad for everyone, regardless of if you are insured. https://t.co/KOUKTSFVzD

Play this tape to the end and you find people not going to the hospital even if they’re really sick. The federal government needs to announce that they’ll pay for all of these bills https://t.co/HfyBFBXhja

Last week, the Miami Herald reported that Osmel Martinez Azcue “received a notice from his insurance company about a claim for $3,270” after he visited a local hospital fearing that he contracted coronavirus during a work trip to China.
“He went to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he said he was placed in a closed-off room,” according to the Herald. “Nurses in protective white suits sprayed some kind of disinfectant smoke under the door before entering, Azcue said. Then hospital staff members told him he’d need a CT scan to screen for coronavirus, but Azcue said he asked for a flu test first.”
Azcue tested positive for the flu and was discharged. “Azcue’s experience shows the potential cost of testing for a disease that epidemiologists fear may develop into a public health crisis in the U.S.,” the Herald noted.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, highlighted Azcue’s case in a tweet last Friday.
The coronavirus reminds us that we are all in this together. We cannot allow Americans to skip doctor's visits over outrageous bills.
Everyone should get the medical care they need without opening their wallet—as a matter of justice and public health. https://t.co/c4WQMDESHU

The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. surged by more than two dozen over the weekend, bringing the total to 89 as the Trump administration continues to publicly downplay the severity of the outbreak.
Dr. Matt McCarthy, a staff physician at NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, said in an appearance on CNBC‘s “Squawk Box” Monday morning that testing for the coronavirus is still not widely available.
“Before I came here this morning, I was in the emergency room seeing patients,” McCarthy said. “I still do not have a rapid diagnostic test available to me.”
“I’m here to tell you, right now, at one of the busiest hospitals in the country, I don’t have it at my finger tips,” added McCarthy. “I still have to make my case, plead to test people. This is not good. We know that there are 88 cases in the United States. There are going to be hundreds by middle of week. There’s going to be thousands by next week. And this is a testing issue.”

Chinese Company Ships Crates of Masks to Italy Covered in Roman Poetry: ‘We Are Leaves of the Same Tree’,"

(TMU) — A popular Chinese consumer electronics company has shipped crates full of tens of thousands of respirator masks to Italy, stressing that the losses faced by the people of Italy due to the coronavirus epidemic are painful for all of humankind.
The Chinese tech company, Xiaomi, sent the shipments of FFP3 masks to the Italian Civil Protection Department, the government body responsible for coordinating the distribution of resources to local authorities, reports China Daily.
The crates were covered in flyers bearing the Xiaomi “Mi” logo and quotes from the poetry of ancient Roman philosopher Seneca that read:
We are waves of the same sea, leaves of the same tree, flowers of the same garden.
Siamo onde dello stesso mare, foglie dello stesso albero, fiori dello stesso giardino
Italy continues to stand firmly as the epicenter of the global crisis, exceeding even China’s death toll last week despite its much smaller population.
Xiaomi International has become a very popular global brand in recent years, with consumers flocking to the company for its ability to produce flagship phones for a competitive price, as well as excellent mid-range and budget phones with nearly flagship quality. The eccentric company also makes a number of other devices ranging from electric scooters to rice cookers, air conditioners, “smart” mini washing machines, and even tennis shoes.
On its Facebook post announcing the donation, the company said that the action was a result of the company’s feeling of responsibility to the people of Italy who enthusiastically embraced the brand when it entered the local market two years ago.
The post noted:
“Since we arrived two years ago, we have felt loved and deeply integrated into the life of the country. This is also why we felt a duty to support Italy in the management of the COVID-19 epidemic, by donating a first important quantity of FFP3 masks.”

Da quando siamo arrivati due anni fa ci siamo sentiti amati e profondamente integrati nella vita del Paese. Anche per…
Posted by Xiaomi Italia on Thursday, March 5, 2020
Chew Shou Zi, CFO and president of International Xiaomi Corporation, said in a statement:
“The continuous growth and rapid expansion of Xiaomi in Italy are closely linked to our users, fans and the general public; this gesture therefore does not represent only a way to thank and to give our support, but it is the tangible demonstration that we feel like an integral part of this country. And it is precisely this sense of belonging, combined with deep solidarity, that imposes a high sense of responsibility on all citizens as a global company.”
Users greeted the move, with one commenting:
 “I’m happy to see that humanity is still alive. Great quote, btw.” 
While another replied:
 “Xiaomi is a different kind of corporation; it’s a community, a global community making a true difference in the world.”
Over 6,500 Italians test positive for CoViD-19 every day, with the average age of those dying standing at 78.5 years.
Over the weekend, at least 1,400 people died in Italy as the country races to control the horrific spread of the novel virus. On Sunday, an additional 651 Italians died, bringing the death toll to at least 5,400.

"In Sweeping Power Grab, DOJ Seeks Ability to Detain People Indefinitely Without Trial","



Facebook

(ZH) — In a sweeping power grab, the Department of Justice has asked Congress for the ability to go directly to chief judges in order to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies.
The move is part of a recent push to expand government powers during the coronavirus pandemic, according to Politico, which has reviewed documents that detail the DOJ’s requests to lawmakers on this and a host of other topics – including state of limitations, asylum, and how court hearings are conducted.
The move has tapped into a broader fear among civil liberties advocates and Donald Trump’s critics — that the president will use a moment of crisis to push for controversial policy changes. Already, he has cited the pandemic as a reason for heightening border restrictions and restricting asylum claims. He has also pushed for further tax cuts as the economy withers, arguing that it would soften the financial blow to Americans. And even without policy changes, Trump has vast emergency powers that he could legally deploy right now to try and slow the coronavirus outbreak. –Politico
Politico notes that the requests are unlikely to make it through the Democratic-controlled House.
As part of the requests, the DOJ proposed that Congress grant the attorney general the ability to ask that any chief judge of any district court to pause court proceedings “whenever the district court is fully or partially closed by virtue of any natural disaster, civil disobedience, or other emergency situation.” Similarly, these top judges would have broad authority to pause court proceedings during emergencies.
Additionally, the requested changes would explicitly say that people with COVID-19 cannot apply for asylum – a request that comes on the heels of a Friday announcement by the Trump administration that it would begin denying entry to all illegal immigrants at the southern border – including those seeking asylum.
According to Politico, the changes would apply to “any statutes or rules of procedure otherwise affecting pre-arrest, post-arrest, pre-trial, trial, and post-trial procedures in criminal and juvenile proceedings and all civil process and proceedings.”
As we have heard from those in the legal profession, however, the courts have already ground to a virtual halt amid the Chinese coronavirus outbreak – as jurors aren’t coming in, and face-to-face depositions aren’t happening right now in many parts of the country.
The proposed changes have raised concerns over the implications for habeas corpus – the right to appear before a judge and seek release.
“Not only would it be a violation of that, but it says ‘affecting pre-arrest,” said Normal L. Reimer, who heads up the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. “So that means you could be arrested and never brought before a judge until they decide that the emergency or the civil disobedience is over. I find it absolutely terrifying. Especially in a time of emergency, we should be very careful about granting new powers to the government.”
Reimer added that the notion of chief judges suspending court rules during an emergency indefinitely is deeply disturbing.
“That is something that should not happen in a democracy,” he said.
The department also asked Congress to pause the statute of limitations for criminal investigations and civil proceedings during national emergencies, “and for one year following the end of the national emergency,” according to the draft legislative text.
Trump recently declared the coronavirus crisis a national emergency.
Another controversial request: The department is looking to change the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in some cases to expand the use of videoconference hearings, and to let some of those hearings happen without defendants’ consent, according to the draft legislative text.
“Video teleconferencing may be used to conduct an appearance under this rule,” read a draft of potential new language for Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(f), crossing out the phrase “if the defendant consents.”
“Video teleconferencing may be used to arraign a defendant,” read draft text of rule 10(c), again striking out the phrase “if the defendant consents.” –Politico
According to Reimer, forcing people to have hearings over video conference vs. in-person would threaten civil liberties.
“If it were with the consent of the accused person it would be fine,” he said, adding “But if it’s not with the consent of the accused person, it’s a terrible road to go down. We have a right to public trials. People have a right to be present in court.”

How Maintaining Hope Can Keep You Healthier and Happier,"

(CONVERSATION) — Hope can erode when we perceive threats to our way of life, and these days, plenty are out there. As we age, we may struggle with a tragic loss or chronic disease. As we watch the news, we see our political system polarized, hopelessly locked in chaos. The coronavirus spreads wider daily; U.S. markets signaled a lack of hope with a Dow Jones free fall. Losing hope sometimes leads to suicide.
When there is no hope – when people cannot picture a desired end to their struggles – they lose the motivation to endure. As professor emeritus at Virginia Commonwealth University, I’ve studied positive psychology, forgiveness, wellness and the science of hope for more than 40 years. My website offers free resources and tools to help its readers live a more hopeful life.
First, hope is not Pollyannaish optimism – the assumption that a positive outcome is inevitable. Instead, hope is a motivation to persevere toward a goal or end state, even if we’re skeptical that a positive outcome is likely. Psychologists tell us hope involves activity, a can-do attitude and a belief that we have a pathway to our desired outcome. Hope is the willpower to change and the way-power to bring about that change.
With teens and with young or middle-aged adults, hope is a bit easier. But for older adults, it’s a bit harder. Aging often means running up against obstacles that appear unyielding – like recurring health or financial or family issues that just don’t seem to go away. Hope for older adults has to be “sticky,” persevering, a “mature hope.”
Now the good news: this study, from Harvard’s “Human Flourishing Program,” recently published. Researchers examined the impact of hope on nearly 13,000 people with an average age of 66. They found those with more hope throughout their lives had better physical health, better health behaviors, better social support and a longer life. Hope also led to fewer chronic health problems, less depression, less anxiety and a lower risk of cancer.
So if maintaining hope in the long run is so good for us, how do we increase it? Or build hope if it’s MIA? Here are my four suggestions:
Attend a motivational speech – or watch, read or listen to one online, through YouTube, a blog or podcast. That increases hope, although usually the fix is short-lived. How can you build longer-term hope?
Engage with a religious or spiritual community. This has worked for millennia. Amidst a community of like believers, people have drawn strength, found peace and experienced the elevation of the human spirit, just by knowing there is something or someone much larger than them.
Forgive. Participating in a forgiveness group, or completing a forgiveness do-it-yourself workbook, builds hope, say scientists. It also reduces depression and anxiety, and increases (perhaps this is obvious) your capacity to forgive. That’s true even with long-held grudges. I’ve personally found that successfully forgiving someone provides a sense of both the willpower and way-power to change.
Choose a “hero of hope.” Some have changed history: Nelson Mandela endured 27 years of imprisonment yet persevered to build a new nation. Franklin Delano Roosevelt brought hope to millions for a decade during the Great Depression. Ronald Reagan brought hope to a world that seemed forever mired in the Cold War. From his fourth State of the Union address: “Tonight, I’ve spoken of great plans and great dreams. They’re dreams we can make come true. Two hundred years of American history should have taught us that nothing is impossible.”
Hope changes systems that seem stuck. Katherine Johnson, the black mathematician whose critical role in the early days of NASA and the space race was featured in the movie “Hidden Figures,” recently died at age 101. The movie (and the book on which it was based) brought to light her persistence against a system that seemed forever stuck. Bryan Stevenson, who directs the Equal Justice Initiative, and the subject of the movie “Just Mercy,” has successfully fought to help those wrongly convicted or incompetently defended to get off death row.
Stevenson laments that he could not help everyone who needed it; he concluded that he lived in a broken system, and that, in fact, he too was a broken man. Yet he constantly reminded himself of what he had told everyone he tried to help: “Each of us,” he said, “is more than the worst thing we’ve ever done.” Hope changes all of us. By regaining his hope, Bryan Stevenson’s example inspires us.
Regardless of how hard we try, we cannot eliminate threats to hope. Bad stuff happens. But there are the endpoints of persistent hope: We become healthier and our relationships are happier. We can bring about that hope by buoying our willpower, bolstering our persistence, finding pathways to our goals and dreams, and looking for heroes of hope. And just perhaps, one day, we too can be such a hero.

A Simulation for a Fictional Coronavirus Pandemic Was Held Last Year,"

UPDATE: This article has been challenged by Lead Stories and rated false.
After receiving questions about the pandemic simulation, Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security issued a statement:
“Recently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction.”
***
(ZH) — As of this morning, the deadly coronavirus that originated in China has killed 26 people and infected more than 900.
But according to one simulation run less than three months ago, things could get much, much worse. Less than three months ago, Eric Toner, a scientist at the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security, had run a simulation of a global pandemic involving the coronavirus, according to Business Insider.
His simulation predicted that 65 million people could die “within 18 months.”

He commented:
 “I have thought for a long time that the most likely virus that might cause a new pandemic would be a coronavirus.”
As of now, the outbreak is not a pandemic, but it has been reported in eight different countries. Toner’s simulation said that nearly “every country in the world” would have the virus after six months.
He commented:
“We don’t yet know how contagious it is. We know that it is being spread person to person, but we don’t know to what extent. An initial first impression is that this is significantly milder than SARS. So that’s reassuring. On the other hand, it may be more transmissible than SARS, at least in the community setting.”
His analysis used a fictional virus called CAPS, which would be resistant to any modern vaccine and would be deadlier than SARS. The simulation involved a virus originating in Brazil’s pig farms. The outbreak started small, with farmers coming down with symptoms, before spreading to crowded and impoverished areas.
The simulation also showed flights being cancelled and travel bookings falling by 45%, as people disseminated false information on social media. It also triggered a financial crisis around the globe, with global GDP falling 11% and stock markets falling 20% to 40%.
No word on whether or not the simulation accounted for the modern monetary theory the Fed is essentially governing with now.
He also claimed that the current coronavirus could have major economic impact if it the total cases hits the thousands.
He concluded:
“If we could make it so that we could have a vaccine within months rather than years or decades, that would be a game changer. But it’s not just the identification of potential vaccines. We need to think even more about how they are manufactured on a global scale and distributed and administered to people.”
“It’s part of the world we live in now. We’re in an age of epidemics.”
Of course here in the United States the CDC is assuring us that we don’t have anything to be concerned about…
“We don’t want the American public to be worried about this because their risk is low,” says Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “On the other hand, we are taking this very seriously and are dealing very closely with Chinese authorities.”
Hopefully they are correct, and hopefully this outbreak will blow over sooner rather than later.

(TMU) — Satellite images from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have shown a significant drop in pollution over China amidst the unprecedented quarantine as a result of the novel coronavirus that began in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Due to the quarantine, air travel and mass transit has halted as have numerous industries in throughout the country.
Images coming out of some of China’s biggest cities show completely empty city streets in areas that are typically bustling with activity.
NASA images show coronavirus shutdown has cleared China pollution https://t.co/23rcrsy1PW
— Sky News (@SkyNews) February 29, 2020

The maps released by NASA show the change in nitrogen dioxide levels before and after the quarantine. Nitrogen dioxide is a toxic emission from factories, power plants, and vehicles.
China’s emissions hit a record high not long ago in 2018.
The images compare the levels of pollution from the first three weeks of 2020 with that of 10 – 25 of February.
Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center said:
“This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event.”
Scientists previously announced that China’s emissions were reduced by at least a quarter during two weeks in February and now we can see proof with our own eyes. According to scientists, the drop first began in the city of Wuhan, the source of the outbreak and the first city to come under quarantine.
While it is difficult to find a silver lining to the situation that millions of residents of China are currently facing, the resulting sharp drop in the burning of fossil fuels and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the country that produces the most certainly is one.
People across the globe have had their eyes glued to China as the outbreak wreaked havoc on everyday life.
Despite the long lasting massive quarantines, comparisons to influenza and other viruses continue to be made in countries that haven’t yet been touched by major interruptions of daily life due to the virus.
In addition to finding a silver lining in the midst of an unprecedented experience, these images serve to remind observers of just how unusual and unparalleled the effect of and response to the virus truly are.

How to Stop Touching Your Face to Minimize Spread of Coronavirus,"



Facebook

(CONVERSATION) — Public health officials consistently promote hand-washing as a way for people to protect themselves from the COVID-19 coronavirus.
However, this virus can live on metal and plastic for days, so simply adjusting your eyeglasses with unwashed hands may be enough to infect yourself. Thus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have been telling people to stop touching their faces.
We are experts in psychological science and public health. Brian Labus is an expert in communicable diseases who knows what people should do to avoid becoming infected. Stephen Benning is a clinical psychologist who helps clients change their habits and manage stress in healthy ways. Kimberly Barchard is an expert in research methods who wanted to know what the research says about face-touching. Together, we used our clinical expertise and the research literature to identify the best practices to reduce face-touching and lower people’s chances of catching COVID-19.
People touch their faces frequently. They wipe their eyes, scratch their noses, bite their nails and twirl their mustaches. People touch their faces more when they are anxious, embarrassed or stressed, but also when they aren’t feeling anything at all. Studies show that students, office workers, medical personnel and people on trains touch their faces between nine and 23 times per hour, on average.
Why is it so hard to stop? Face-touching rewards us by relieving momentary discomforts like itches and muscle tension. These discomforts usually pass within a minute, but face-touching provides immediate relief that eventually makes it a habitual response that resists change.
Stop touching your face, Uncle Bill! Do you want to get coronavirus? Brian Keith was always touching his face to show irritation, deep thought, resignation, exasperation, and various other emotions. He'd be having a hard time right now. #touchingyourface #familyaffair #classictv pic.twitter.com/2eBkeAsupn

Habit reversal training is a well-established behavior modification technique that helps people stop a variety of seemingly automatic behaviors, such as nervous tics, nail-biting and stuttering. It trains people to notice the discomfort that prompts their habits, select another behavior to use until the discomfort passes and change their surroundings to lessen their discomfort.
You may have already changed some of your other habits – for example, by coughing into your elbow instead of your hands, or greeting others with a bow or wave instead of a handshake. But unlike coughing and hand-shaking, people frequently touch their faces without being aware of doing so. So the first step in reducing face-touching is becoming aware of it.
Each time you touch your face, notice how you touched your face, the urge or sensation that preceded it and the situation you were in – what you were doing, where you were physically or what you were feeling emotionally. If you usually don’t notice when you touch your face, you can ask someone else to point it out.
Self-monitoring is more effective when people create a physical record. You can create a log where you briefly describe each instance of face-touching. For example, log entries might say:
• Scratched nose with finger, felt itch, while at my desk
• Fiddled with eyeglasses, hands tingled, frustrated
• Rested chin on palm, neck sore, while reading
• Bit fingernail, nail caught on pants, watching TV
Self-monitoring is more effective if people share their outcomes publicly, so consider sharing your results with friends or post it on social media.
Now that you are aware of the behavior you want to change, you can replace it with a competing response that opposes the muscle movements needed to touch your face. When you feel the urge to touch your face, you can clench your fists, sit on your hands, press your palms onto the tops of your thighs or stretch your arms straight down at your sides. This competing response should be inconspicuous and use a position that can be held for at least a minute. Use the competing response for as long as the urge to touch your face persists.
Some sources recommend object manipulation, in which you occupy your hands with something else. You can rub your fingertips, fiddle with a pen or squeeze a stress ball. The activity shouldn’t involve touching any part of your head. For tough-to-break habits, object manipulation isn’t as effective as competing responses, perhaps because people tend to play with objects when bored, but touch their faces and hair when anxious.

Changing your environment can reduce your urges to touch your face and your need to use alternative responses. Use your log to figure out what situations or emotions are associated with your face-touching. For example:
• If your glasses keep slipping off your nose, you can use ear hooks or hair ties to prevent slippage.
• If you bite your nails, you can use a file to keep your nails short, or wear gloves or fingertip bandages, so that nail-biting is impossible.
• If allergies make your eyes or skin itch or make your nose run, you can limit your exposure to allergens or take antihistamines.
• If you get food stuck between your teeth, you can brush your teeth after each meal.
• If your hair gets in your eyes and mouth, you can use an elastic, scarf or hair product to keep it back.

Most people cannot entirely eliminate unwanted habits, but they can reduce them. Consistent with the principles of harm reduction, just reducing face-touching lessens the opportunities for viruses to enter your system.
Sometimes you need to touch your face: flossing your teeth, putting in contact lenses, wiping food off your lips, putting on makeup or shaving your jaw. Remember to wash your hands first. To adjust your glasses without first washing your hands, use a tissue and throw it out immediately after use. Avoid finger food and using unwashed hands to put food into your mouth. Wash your hands first, or use utensils or the wrapper to handle the food.
Other ways you can reduce the spread of infectious diseases include practicing social spacing, washing hands thoroughly with soap and water or hand sanitizer and disinfecting high-touch surfaces regularly. When your hands touch contaminated surfaces, though, the suggestions above may help you avoid touching your face before you wash them again.

(TMU) — As authorities in China and across the world continue to struggle to contain an outbreak of the new novel coronavirus, curious internet users are wondering what the connection is between the deadly virus and Mexican beer Corona Extra.
Just to be clear, there is no connection between the Mexican pale lager and the outbreak—which has infected over 6,000 people in China and killed at least 132.
However, this hasn’t stopped online searches for “beer virus,” “corona beer virus,” and “beer coronavirus” from surging across search engines since January 18, according to Google Trends data.
Global search interest for “coronavirus symptoms” has spiked +1,050% this week. 😷 Here are the top searched questions in the past 24 hours.#coronavirus #GoogleTrends pic.twitter.com/bPVsL3hCYW

From Jan. 18 to Jan. 26, Google Trends found that “corona beer virus” searches climbed by 2,300 percent while searches for “beer coronavirus” jumped 3,233 percent. In the meantime, “beer virus” jumped by 744 percent.
It remains unclear whether internet users were searching for the many memes connecting the beer and the virus or if they were genuinely curious about any possible connection between the beverage and the outbreak.

(TMU) — The Wuhan coronavirus—now called 2019-nCoV—is spreading rapidly at an alarming rate. There are an estimated 1,975 cases and 56 deaths in China alone, in addition to confirmed patients in at least 13 countries with several potential cases inside the United States and elsewhere.
UPDATE – 1/25/20: 7:30 p.m. EST — South China Morning Post reports on January 25th, the new toll of cases has drastically increased up to 1,700, while the number of deaths is 55, as Chinese President Xi Jinping has called for international help to contain the outbreak.  Xinhua reported on Sunday that the new official death count is now 56, with a massive 1,975 cases now confirmed within China and 2,684 suspected unconfirmed cases according to Chinese health officials.
Australia is now reporting 4 confirmed cases, while authorities are saying more are expected. Malaysia has also confirmed several new cases, according to reports.
The three virus patients in Malaysia are all related to a Chinese man who was detected with the virus in Singapore, according to Channel News Asia. Malaysia is now claiming there is a fourth case according to Reuters. Canada has confirmed its first case of the coronavirus as announced by Ontario health officials according to Global News Canada.
Japan confirmed its third case of the Wuhan coronavirus, according to Japan’s Health Ministry. China further imposed even more restrictions on other cities across central Hubei province, restricting a total of 56 million people, according to AP.  Nationwide throughout Beijing measures to detect the virus on flights, trains, buses were announced as well. The western China province of Qinghai has confirmed its first case of Wuhan coronavirus, according to the local health authority. 29 out of 34 provincial jurisdictions have activated the highest emergency response. China is also sending in its medical response military to affected areas especially Wuhan, the origin of the virus.
Chinese President Xi Jinping said China was facing a “grave situation” warning the virus was accelerating. China has locked-down most provinces and the death toll has now risen to 42.
Many other countries are expected to confirm cases over the weekend. As Reuters wrote: “The virus has caused alarm because it is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. And because it is new, humans have not been able to build any immunity to it. “
According to a State Dept source, (same person I used for my Venezuela article last year & numerous other articles.)

Texas is investigating a suspected case of the Chinese coronavirus while there are rumors of as many as nine suspected cases in LA and one confirmed in Chicago at the time of this report. The CDC also announced they are monitoring 63 people who came into contact with patient zero in the U.S. or the case in Chicago. Two suspected cases have been sent to the CDC from Minnesota.
U.S. lawmakers said health authorities expect to confirm a third case of coronavirus in the United States following a closed-door briefing in Washington between federal health officials and lawmakers according to Bloomberg.
New reports suggest that there are now three confirmed cases in France, marking Europe’s first cases of coronavirus. A 48-year-old man tested positive after passing through Wuhan. He is being treated in a Bordeaux hospital and came in contact with approximately 10 people between his arrival to France on Wednesday and his hospitalization. Little is known about the second and third case that is being treated in Paris.
China has quarantined the following 16 cities (total population of 46 million):
Wuhan: 11 million
Huanggang: 7.5 million
Xiangyang: 6.1 million
Yichang: 4.2 million
Jingmen: 3 million
Xianning: 2.8 million
Huangshi: 2.5 million
Suizhou: 2.2 million
Xiantao: 1.6 million
Ezhou: 1 million
Qianjiang: 962,000
Enshi: 780,000
Xiaogan: 780,000
Zhijiang: 550,000
Dangyang: 560,000
Chibi: 530,000
Here’s what we know so far:
Total number of confirmed cases is over 900 with 26 dead.
China has restricted travel for 46 million people.
Hospitals in Wuhan make urgent pleas for help and supplies.
U.K. and U.S. governments tell citizens to avoid outbreak zones.
Two deaths have now been reported outside Wuhan.
Health officials expect to confirm a third U.S. case of coronavirus soon.
The unnamed 30-year-old man from Washington state is being treated by a robot in a guarded bio-containment room at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington—a fact that illustrates the danger of this virus.
The U.S. citizen had returned to Seattle in the middle of last week after traveling to Wuhan on January 15, according to the CDC.
Earlier this week several major U.S. airports including those in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Chicago’s O’Hare began screening airline passengers arriving from central China for the virus. However, the confirmed patient in Chicago exhibited no symptoms at the time and therefore would not have been caught by an airport screening.
The CDC is sending 100 staffers to aid in the screenings at major airports.
There have also been reports of domestic flights in Wuhan being scanned for the virus by medical personnel in hazmat suits according to video posted by Yahoo News.
Shocking footage uploaded to social media also shows citizens in China collapsing on the streets.

Other video uploaded to social media shows people filling the halls in a Red Cross Hospital in Wuhan, the city at the epicenter of the deadly viral outbreak. People can be seen covered by sheets and blankets in the video, leading some to believe that they are deceased.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far declined to call the outbreak a global health emergency while the Center For Disease Control (CDC) has issued a level three warning (Avoid Nonessential Travel) with the U.S. State Department, advising the avoidance of China and specifically Wuhan.
I am not declaring the new #coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency of international concern today. The Emergency Committee was divided over whether the outbreak represents a PHEIC. This is an emergency in China, but it has not yet become a global health emergency. https://t.co/16knaV4lMZ
— Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus (@DrTedros) January 23, 2020

The U.S. military has also warned its personnel in Japan to watch out for symptoms of the deadly pneumonia-like virus, according to an alert posted by Stripes.
If you must travel to China, the following precautions are recommended:
Avoid contact with sick people.
Avoid animals (alive or dead), animal markets, and products that come from animals (such as uncooked meat).
Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.
Older adults and travelers with underlying health issues may be at risk for more severe disease and should discuss travel with their healthcare provider.
If you traveled to Wuhan in the last 14 days and feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, you should:
Seek medical care right away. Before you go to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about your recent travel and your symptoms.
Avoid contact with others.
Not travel while sick.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not your hands) when coughing or sneezing.
Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.
Scientists have said that the coronavirus is similar to the Spanish flu and suspect it most likely came from snakes. The outdoor food market that is alleged to be the origin included over 100 different animals both live and dead, as TMU reported.
Symptoms include a fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. However, according to Chinese state media, some are not experiencing any of these symptoms and are instead experiencing nausea, diarrhea, tiredness, bad concentration, headache, irregular heartbeat, chest pain, cornea inflammation, and muscular pains in the limbs, back, and waist.
The WHO has advised governments to be prepared for the disease and to be ready to test anyone with symptoms that has traveled to affected regions.
A top official at the U.S. National Institute of Health (NIH) revealed Wednesday that trials for a vaccine targeting 2019-nCoV could potentially begin within three months.
Anthony S. Fauci, the director of NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Bloomberg Law that they are working with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna Inc. to develop a vaccine.
“We’re already working on it,” Fauci said. “And hopefully, in a period of about three months, we’ll be able to start a phase I trial in humans.“
 According to the Daily Mail, a report written by researchers from England, Scotland, and Florida believe that up to 350,000 people could potentially be infected in Wuhan by the beginning of February.
Many people suspect that the Chinese government is covering up the actual number of people who have thus far been infected by the virus. Some are even stating that the virus itself is far more dangerous and is currently mutating, according to posts on social media. One Wuhan patient stated on Twitter in Chinese that the virus that triggered such an epidemic is not a coronavirus but something else that is not included in the official report:
“This is a very aggressive virus, mine is not the coronavirus. The numbers are only covering the coronavirus. Mine is another (type of) viral pneumonia.”
Wang Guangfa, a top medic who contracted coronavirus, says the deadly respiratory disease is so contagious it can be transmitted through the eyes and recommends for people to wear eye protective gear.

One journalist shared a picture on Twitter allegedly showing that all staff at hospitals are forbidden to discuss the latest development of the outbreak with family, relatives, and friends through email, phone calls, texts, WeChat, Weibo, or e-mail. This suggests that China is in fact trying to cover up something about the virus.

A source on the ground told TMU that Wuhan is already running out of medical resources with hospitals and doctors asking for donations of supplies privately.
Last year in December, shortly before the first known case, scientists argued that the global community as a whole was not ready for a disease X in a pandemic preparedness exercise called Event 201. The program was a collaboration between the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Event 201 simulated a fictional coronavirus called CAPS.

China Confirms Human-to-Human Transmission of Deadly New Virus as 14 Medics Catch Infection,"

(TMU) — China’s National Health Commission has confirmed that a new SARS-like coronavirus has the ability to jump between humans. Several airports are now examining passengers prior to take off in hopes of stopping the spread of the illness that has so far killed four people.
Those infected with the unnamed coronavirus go on to develop pneumonia.
Fourteen medical workers treating those infected with the mystery coronavirus in Wuhan have now been diagnosed with pneumonia with one additional suspected case, according to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. The Health Commission also revealed that the virus is able to jump from human to human.
The origins of the outbreak is said to be Wuhan, a central city in China with 11 million people. The disease was reportedly first picked up at a fresh food market. Since then, the mystery virus that is baffling scientists has spread to additional areas of China including Beijing, Guangdong province, and Shanghai, with more than 200 reported cases according to Reuters. There have also been two reported cases in Thailand, one in Japan, and one in South Korea.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the number of cases has tripled since the first case was confirmed.
The rate of the outbreak has begun to worry experts. Observers are concerned the Chinese government may not be telling the full truth of the outbreak due to the large population of 11 million in Wuhan.
Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London are warning that the true number of those infected is likely far higher than what is officially being acknowledged.

Airports all over the world—including those in major U.S. cities like San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles—are proceeding with the screening of travelers from Wuhan as fears of a global pandemic have been raised.
There have also been reports of domestic flights in Wuhan being scanned for the virus by medical personnel in hazmat suits according to video posted by Yahoo News.
Zhong Nanshan, a Chinese official tasked with investigating the virus, reassured the public that there was no danger of a repeat of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic during the 2002-2003 outbreak as long as precautions were taken by Chinese medical officials. The SARS outbreak started in China and killed nearly 800 people across the globe.
“It took only two weeks to identify the novel coronavirus,” Zhong told China’s state news agency Xinhua.
The World Health Organization (WHO) stated on Twitter in an informational thread:
“An animal source seems the most likely primary source of this novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, with some limited human-to-human transmission occurring between close contacts.”
#China🇨🇳 has reported to WHO 139 new cases of the novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in #Wuhan, #Beijing and #Shenzhen over the past two days.This is the result of increased searching and testing for 2019-nCoV among people sick with respiratory illness. pic.twitter.com/qAuaFzYmXH
— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) January 19, 2020

Researchers worry the number of infections are being underestimated. Hong Kong’s Apple Daily reports that the WHO first said the virus had “limited” ability to travel from human to human, but Chinese officials now contradict that claim.
The WHO also called for an emergency committee meeting to determine whether an international health emergency should be issued.
Chinese President Xi Jinping stated that it is “extremely crucial” to contain the outbreak. Some believe that the virus is being under reported and covered up like the SARS virus was, the Guardian reported.
“The state-run Global Times said in an editorial on Sunday: In the early days of Sars, there was a cover-up and delayed reporting. Such things can never be repeated again in China,” the Guardian wrote.
In 2004, China punished five top officials of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for the outbreak of SARS. The investigation found that the release of the virus was due to the negligence of two CDC employees who were infected and was not deliberate, China Daily reported.
The new mystery virus exhibits acute respiratory infection symptoms with many having developed severe pneumonia, fever, cough, and chest pains. Little else is known about it. However, some cases have presented without an increase in body temperature.
Authorities have yet to identify the current coronavirus which is common in animals that occasionally leaps to humans. This is especially worrying given that the Chinese New Year is right around the corner with hundreds of millions expected to travel abroad and within China’s providences on trains and planes to celebrate.
So far the WHO has not recommended any travel restrictions and Chinese authorities have not yet issue any either.

"Video Shows Huge Decline in China Pollution During Lockdown, Then Rapidly Returning to Normal","

(TMU) — Shocking new satellite imagery has been released by the European Space Agency (ESA) that shows the massive decrease in air pollution over China following the coronavirus outbreak and nationwide lockdown, as well as the rapid return of emissions as the country’s quarantine measures were eased.
The imagery compares air pollution levels—specifically nitrogen dioxide emissions produced by the burning of fossil fuels over China—between December 20 and March 16, and is based on data from the Copernicus Sentinel-5P satellite. Similar images taken between January 1 and March 11 over Italy revealed a major drop in pollution as the European nation implemented major controls to curb the spread of the novel virus.
The ESA reported:
“As news of the coronavirus broke out in the Hubei province, China, in late December 2019, stricter measures were put in place. As a result, by late January, factories were closed and streets were cleared as Chinese authorities had ceased daily activities to stop the spread of the illness.
This led to the dramatic reduction in nitrogen dioxide concentrations—those released by power plants, industrial facilities and vehicles—in all major Chinese cities between late-January and February. The drop in concentrations also coincided with Lunar New Year celebrations, which usually sees a similar drop in concentrations each year.”

ESA mission manager Claus Zehner believes that nitrogen dioxide levels had dropped to roughly 60 percent amid China’s draconian, and largely effective, lockdown measures.
The agency also noted:
“By combining satellite observations with detailed computer models of the atmosphere, their studies indicated a reduction of around 20-30 percent in surface particulate matter over large parts of China.”
On Monday, China once again reported no new community transmissions of the virus but confirmed that 39 infections had been brought in from abroad while nine more people died in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged. No new cases of the novel coronavirus have been registered in Wuhan for five consecutive days.
As China continues to successfully beat back the CoViD-19 outbreak, social control measures in the Communist Party-governed East Asian giant have been relaxed. In recent days, over 500 cinema screen have reopened in the country, reports Variety.
Trends in the People’s Republic that show people trickling back to work and communities returning to a state of relative normalcy stand in sharp contrast to the developing crisis in the West, where new infections have rapidly been cascading, resulting in mass panic, upended markets, and a mad dash by governments to coordinate their response.

Ohio Unemployment Skyrockets by 600% After All Bars and Restaurants Shuttered,"

(ZH) — Is a global recession already beginning as the vast majority of the US and other countries’ workforce grinds to a halt while large cities begin to receive ‘shelter in place’ directives? Yes, says Goldman; and more and more top economists are saying Tuesday it’s a near-certainty. State unemployment numbers are about to bear that out.
A new Marist poll this week for NPR/PBS News found 18% of US adults responding they’d already either been laid off or had significant reduction of hours due to the ripple effect of the pandemic.
For an indicator of just how high national unemployment may skyrocket, look no further than Ohio, which on Sunday night declared a ‘health emergency’ and shut down all bars and restaurants state-wide. Journalist Liz Skalka for The Toledo Blade reports that Ohio Senator Rob Portman (R) received “new data on Ohio’s unemployment claims today: 45,000 claims this week compared to 6,500 last week.”
The state-wide ordered shutdown of dining and drink establishments by Ohio Governor Mike DeWine on Sunday night impacted about 10% of the state’s workforce, some 500,000 people.
A 45,000 unemployment claims number jump from 6,500 means a whopping one-week increase of 592%, and surely now already to soar past 600% into next week.
Likely, Ohio is the canary in the coal-mine at a moment restaurants and bars across New York, California, and other large states are also fast being ordered to shutter their doors.
if this is accurate, and if representative of nat'l trends, that would suggest new UI claims are jumping by a factor of 7., putting them in the 1.4-1.5 million range. That's more than double where they were at the peak of the last recession. Hmmm.https://t.co/oxSYAUs9yJ
— Jeff Jensen (@JJensen_13) March 17, 2020

As of Tuesday Ohio announced 67 confirmed Covid-19 cases across 16 counties, resulting in 17 hospitalizations thus far.
Federal data issued in February counts 11,674,000 employees in restaurants in bars across the nation. These jobs are about to be decimated, assuming the latest breaking Ohio numbers of just the past week sets the trend.
“I think that the odds of a global recession are close to 100 percent right now,” Kevin Hassett, Trump’s former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers told CNN on Tuesday. “I think in the US, we’re going to have a very terrible second quarter.”
“You’re looking at one of the biggest negative jobs numbers that we’ve ever seen,” he added, warning further the US is set to shed 1 million jobs in March.

Scientist Who Simulated Global Coronavirus Outbreak 3 Months Ago Makes Chilling Statement,"



Facebook







Twitter







Reddit







Email



(TMU) — A senior scientist who participated in a simulation of the global impact of a coronavirus outbreak has stated that “the cat is out of the bag” when it comes to the virus and that China is unlikely to contain its spread.
Eric Toner, Senior Scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and Senior Scientist in the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health and Engineering, said during an interview with CNBC that China’s efforts to contain the current outbreak of the rapidly spreading upper-respiratory illness known as 2019-nCoV are “unlikely to be effective.”

Three months ago Toner, along with the World Economic Forum and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, took part in a simulation called Event 201 centered around a fictional coronavirus (not 2019-nCoV) named CAPS that could potentially kill hundreds of millions of people under the right circumstances.
Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security recently issued a statement about Event 201:
“Recently, the Center for Health Security has received questions about whether that pandemic exercise predicted the current novel coronavirus outbreak in China. To be clear, the Center for Health Security and partners did not make a prediction during our tabletop exercise. For the scenario, we modeled a fictional coronavirus pandemic, but we explicitly stated that it was not a prediction.”
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declined to call the situation a global emergency at this time. However, the Geneva-based organization stated that it considers China’s current situation a health emergency. As of Sunday night WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was on his way to Beijing to “strengthen our partnership” with China “in providing further protection against the outbreak,” according to Reuters.
Toner stated during the CNBC interview that he believed it was a mistake for the World Health Organization to not issue a global public health emergency. He went on to describe the threat from his point of view, expressing that the point of their exercise wasn’t just to estimate death toll but to showcase the potential consequences on society and the global economy.
Toner asserted China has participated in the “largest effort ever to contain a city.“ However, the doctor also said, “I don’t think it’s likely to be effective, as people have already escaped.” Wuhan’s mayor Zhou Xianwang revealed on Sunday that he was correct. During a press conference, the mayor stated that an estimated 5 million residents had already left the city due to the virus outbreak and Chinese New Year celebrations.
China has so far quarantined at least 50 million people as TMU reported over the weekend. The country has also locked-down much of its transportation system within cities barring citizens from traveling in an attempt to control the virus spread.
According to reports on Twitter, U.S. residents are being evacuated on a flight today from Wuhan.
Lots of things going on right now. People are getting calls confirming their spot on the plane! Unfortunately there is zero solution provided for transportation. All public transport is closed, and people won’t venture out to give you a lift. #wuhan #coronavirus

China’s latest announcement puts the totals at 82 dead from the virus and nearly 3,000 people infected. However, according to Prof. Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College, the true number is likely closer to 100,000 affected by the virus. On Monday University of Hong Kong academics estimated that 43,590 people were infected in Wuhan as of Saturday, according to the South China Morning Post.
According to the Daily Mail, a report written by researchers from England, Scotland, and Florida believe that up to 350,000 people could potentially be infected in Wuhan by the beginning of February.
On Sunday, the minister in charge of China’s National Health Commission (NHC), Ma Xiaowei, admitted that battling the outbreak had become difficult after it was discovered that the new virus could be transmitted even during the incubation period, which separates the virus from SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) which lacked that trait.
The virus’ incubation period allowing infection may be what makes the virus more dangerous than most in its family. Ma explained, “From observations, the virus is capable of transmission even during incubation period.” He indicated that the incubation period lasted from one to 14 days. “Some patients have normal temperatures and there are many milder cases. There are hidden carriers.”
Ma added that upwards to 2,360 military and civilian doctors and nurses had been sent to Wuhan from Beijing to combat the virus.
In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced over the weekend that there are now five confirmed cases in the U.S with a new case in Arizona. The CDC issued mixed messages on Sunday, first stating coronavirus is an “emerging public threat” that is “serious” and later contradicting itself by saying it was a “low” threat to the U.S. population at this time.
CDC says coronavirus is not spreading in the U.S. at this time, which means the threat to the U.S. population is ""low at this time"" https://t.co/hSjr1uHLLa

Thus far deaths have only been reported in China, but that could change quickly as the Chinese government admitted on Sunday that the virus is “strengthening.” Scientists have estimated the virus has a reproduction (R0) rate of between 2.5 and 3.8 according to Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding a public health scientist who taught 15 years at Harvard and an NYT-featured pharma whistleblower.
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD – the new coronavirus is a 3.8!!! How bad is that reproductive R0 value?

UPDATE: Transmission of #coronoavirus estimated at 2.6 by another research group (lower than the 3.8 initial reports). But 2.6 is still extremely bad —each infected person will infect 2.6 others. Even the authors admit #CoronaOutbreak containment will be very difficult. Thread: pic.twitter.com/Gg2vyIevL4

Symptoms include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. However, according to Chinese state media some are not experiencing any of these symptoms and are instead experiencing nausea, diarrhea, tiredness, bad concentration, headache, irregular heartbeat, chest pain, cornea inflammation, and muscular pains in the limbs, back, and waist.
U.S President Donald Trump tweeted Monday morning that the U.S. is “in very close communication with China concerning the virus.”
We are in very close communication with China concerning the virus. Very few cases reported in USA, but strongly on watch. We have offered China and President Xi any help that is necessary. Our experts are extraordinary!
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2020

UPDATE 5:15pm EST — On Monday, the WHO “admitted an error” in assessing the risk of the coronavirus. A Sunday night situation report listed the risk as “very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level,” according to the AFP. The WHO admits that the agency “incorrectly” listed the global risk as moderate in reports on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.

Citizen Journalist Goes Missing After Reporting About Coronavirus From Wuhan,"

(TMU) — The recent death of Wuhan doctor turned whistleblower Li Wenliang sparked outrage across China and the rest of the world. Activists and independent journalists trapped in the quarantine zones say that Li could have prevented the current outbreak if the government had listened to him instead of attempting to cover it up.
In the days after his death, Chinese social media platforms were filled will demands for freedom of speech as well as suggestions that the government cover-up allowed the illness to spread. Evidence of crackdowns have also spread online, with footage of Chinese police in medical gear forcibly removing people from their homes appearing on social media.
In the chaos of the past week, lawyer and citizen journalist Chen Qiushi, who was doing very dangerous reporting from the quarantine zone in Wuhan, has gone missing, and many of his loved ones say that he was captured by the Chinese government. Chen was active on social media and was keeping in regular contact with his friends until Thursday when he went silent and could no longer be reached.
After he disappeared a close friend posted a video to Twitter of Chen’s mother pleading for help to find her son.

Xu Xiaodong, a well-known martial artist and friend of Chen, later posted a video saying that police admitted to detaining Chen in a quarantine, according to CNN.
“In the last few hours the Qingdao public security officers and state security officers … notified Qiushi’s parents that Qiushi has already been detained in the name of quarantine. Qiushi’s mother immediately asked them where and when he was taken away, they declined to say,” said Xu.
Xu also said that Chen was in good health the last time that anyone had heard from him.
However, when CNN contacted the Wuhan and Qingdao city police, both insisted that they had no information about Chen.
Chen has a long history of activism and has had previous penalties from Chinese authorities for his efforts in independent journalism. During last year’s protests in Hong Kong, Chen was reporting to 740,000 followers on Weibo about the demonstrations, often contradicting the Chinese government’s version of events.
Following the protests, Chen’s social media accounts were deleted by authorities and all of his footage was wiped from the internet. Chen was also regularly called in for questioning and harassed by police, but continued to persist in his activism and journalism on Twitter and YouTube, both of which are blocked in China unless accessed using a VPN/
During the Chinese Lunar New Year, when many people were fleeing the city as the quarantine was being imposed, Chen rushed into the city of Wuhan to report on the situation.
In his first video from Wuhan, Chen explained:
“I’ve said before that I’m a citizen journalist. What kind of journalist am I if I don’t rush to the front line when there is a disaster? I will use my camera to witness and document what is really happening under Wuhan’s efforts to contain the outbreak. And I’m willing to help spread the voice of Wuhan people to the outside world. While I’m here, I promise I won’t start or spread rumors. I won’t create fear or panic, nor would I cover up the truth.”
Chen was among numerous citizen journalists contradicting the official narrative that was coming from Bejing while reporting independently from Wuhan. Chen’s reporting showed that the virus appeared to be much worse than was being suggested by official sources. Chen showed the world the overcrowded hospitals and heavy-handed tactics being used by police.
“I’m scared, I have the virus in front of me and behind me China’s law enforcement,” Chen said in one of his last videos that was recorded in a hotel room on January 30. In the same video he revealed that his parents back home in Qingdao were already being harassed by authorities.

Another citizen journalist, Fang Bin, was also detained over his reporting from Wuhan. According to the LA Times, Fang was visited by police in hazmat suits in the middle of the night and taken into custody after he showed videos of full body bags strewn about a hospital and piled up in an ambulance outside.

The police reportedly asked him, “You went to such a dangerous place, couldn’t you have been infected? What if your sickness spreads to others?”
Fang Bin asked that the police come back with a warrant, but instead they stormed into his house, seized all of his electronics, and took him to a police station where he was accused of rumormongering and accepting bribes from foreign entities to spread misinformation.

Fang was later released and published another impassioned video online where he called for a full-blown revolution.
Virtually imprisoned at home, #FangBin, who shot that viral ""8 bodies in 5 minutes"" video of #Wuhan hospital, says the only reason the police hasn't broken in is the world's attention.

Fang, Chen, and Li are among 300 Chinese citizens who have been detained, fined, or otherwise punished by authorities for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders.

(TMU) — Just as the COVID-19 Coronavirus was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, also an accomplished actor and musician, announced that they have tested positive for the virus. Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are both 63 years old, which puts them at a much higher risk of having serious complications from the illness.
According to a statement published by a spokesperson for the Hanks family, the couple caught the virus in Australia where Hanks was in the middle of filming for Baz Luhrmann’s untitled Elvis Presley biopic in which Hanks is playing Presley’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker.
The statement from Hanks reads:
“Hello, folks. Rita and I are down here in Australia. We felt a bit tired, like we had colds, and some body aches. Rita had some chills that came and went. Slight fevers too. To play things right, as is needed in the world right now, we were tested for the Coronavirus, and were found to be positive.
Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed. We Hanks’ will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no?
We’ll keep the world posted and updated.”",2020-03-11T20:51:44-05:00,https://themindunleashed.com/2020/03/tom-hanks-says-he-and-his-wife-have-coronavirus.html
Chef Andrés Turns Michelin-Starred Restaurants Into Community Soup Kitchens for the Needy,"

(TMU) — Chef José Andrés, the celebrated Spanish-American chef, has long been working hard to offer great food to hungry people whether through his 5-star restaurants or through his charity, World Central Kitchen.
And now, Chef Andrés plans to ensure that people can continue to eat well despite the disruptive and lethal coronavirus pandemic.
On Sunday, the Michelin-starred chef announced on Twitter that while his critically-acclaimed restaurants will be closed to the general public due to the coronavirus outbreak, the kitchens will still be humming along with activity, with eight of his Washington D.C. and New York City locations offering gourmet food to struggling workers and out-of-work families.
In effect, his restaurants will now be transformed into soup kitchens, where hungry people can get nourishing meals between noon and 5 p.m. for $7 each, but “those who cannot afford to pay, we will welcome as well,” he said. Workers at the kitchens will also be receiving paid time off for the first two weeks.
Andrés wrote:
“All my restaurants in DC area are closed until further notice. Here at @ThinkFoodGroup safety of employees & guests is [top] priority. Some restaurants will transform into Community Kitchens to offer to-go lunches for those who need a meal.”
These Community Kitchens will be part of @WCKitchen efforts across the country in the coming days & weeks. Not for enjoyment….but a service for people in need of a plate of food during this emergency. (2/4)
— José Andrés (@chefjoseandres) March 15, 2020

Andrés founded the charity, World Central Kitchen, in 2010 to offer prepared food to needy people in disaster zones in Haiti, Uganda, Cambodia, and even in U.S. locations in Southern California, Hawaii, and Texas. His team helped provide over 3.6 free million meals to the people of Puerto Rico after the devastating Hurricane Maria, earning Andrés major recognition and awards for his good deeds.
Most recently, Chef José and his charity were in Oakland, serving three hot daily meals to the quarantined cruise ship passengers and staff who were stranded offshore aboard the Grand Princess liner.
The charity has also helped provide several thousands of meals to students who otherwise wouldn’t eat due to prolonged school closures.
Chef José has joined the WCK team in Oakland where we continue to serve three meals a day to guests & crew onboard the #GrandPrincess. We’ll be here for a few more days as we also prepare the next steps in our coronavirus response across the country. #ChefsForAmerica pic.twitter.com/FrvZOfuZfc

“I Am Not a Virus”: Outbreak Leads to Shocking Rise in Racism Toward Asian People,"



Facebook

(TMU) — As new cases of the novel coronavirus continue to emerge across East Asia as well as in Europe and North America, another pandemic with possibly more deadly implications has also swept across the globe: the revival of shockingly racist and vile sentiments targeting people of Chinese and East Asian descent in the form of false news reports and general hysteria.
On Thursday, the phenomenon took a heartbreaking turn when a Chinese man collapsed and died from a heart attack in Chinatown in Sydney, Australia. According to reports, onlookers ignored the 60-year-old man as he suffered, refusing to give him CPR and leaving him to die on the sidewalk out of fear that they would catch the coronavirus, according to the Daily Telegraph.

— Jackie Luo (@jackiehluo) January 26, 2020

And while the coronavirus reportedly originated in Wuhan, China, those far removed from the outbreak are feeling the devastating impact of the aggravated racism toward Asians.
South Korean newspaper Hankyoreh reports that in France, a Korean woman complained that she faced bigoted harassment multiple times thanks to the upswing in xenophobia. The newspaper reports that in a post to a South Korean online message board, the woman complained:
“An older man called me a ‘dirty Chinese [expletive].’ A guy who looked like a high schooler got in my face and told me to ‘get lost.’ I really lost it for a moment when a homeless person walking down the street even called me a [derogatory word for a woman].
Even when I explain I’m Korean, people tell me that all Asians should leave. I’d been afraid this might happen, but experiencing it personally has shown me how hard it is to bear such hatred. It makes me afraid to go to crowded places.”
Meanwhile, on France’s BFM TV, an Asian-descended French person complained:
“When I was coming out of a sports stadium in downtown Paris, a boy made fun of me by shouting, ‘Here comes the coronavirus.’”
The complaints come amid an outcry over a headline published last week in local newspaper Courrier Picard that read “Alerte jaune” (Yellow alert) and “Le péril jaune?” (Yellow peril?) alongside an image of a Chinese woman in a protective mask, harkening back to a racist early 20th-century concept of the so-called “Yellow Peril” pitting the so-called “civilized” white, Western world against the alleged “threat” posed by the peoples of the “orient,” or eastern Asia.
Cette leçon de racisme décomplexé vous est offerte par le @CourrierPicard #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/jhcoNmsmm5
— Madjid Messaoudene (@MadjidFalastine) January 26, 2020

The alarming rise in overt racist abuse across public transportation and social media in France has led to many Asians taking to social media using the hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus—or “I’m not a virus.”
From Toronto to even as far as San Diego, Chinese-owned businesses have been sharply impacted. Even across Latin America, seemingly harmless memes about catching the coronavirus from Asian retailers like Chinese variety store Miniso or Korean counterpart Mumuso reflect the irrationality that has gripped the masses.
Every asians are not chinese, every chinese people isn't affected by the virus you fucking racists #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus
— Sophy⁷ (@mochisoph) January 28, 2020

And while many scientists believe that there is a nexus between the coronavirus and animals, with many of those infected having worked in or shopped at a large meat market in Wuhan, a number of uneducated assertions and racist jokes have conflated the diets of Asians and Chinese with the outbreak.
In one clip posted to Twitter by the anonymous user @FreeMindHK, an Asian man can be seen eating live baby mice along with the caption:
“Chinese ‘delicacy,’ probably one of the causes for [the] emergence of #WuhanCoronavirus Source: telegram.”
However, Chinese social media users, including one who claims to reside in Wuhan, deny that live mice is a so-called “delicacy” and have also pointed out that there is nothing in the video that identifies the man as Chinese.
In my Chinese moms chat group, we discussed how to brace ourselves and the kids for the inevitable wave of racism coming our way as this unfolds.
Many of us have never even been to China but know we will not go unscathed. https://t.co/hz7YCPjyb5
— Terri Chu (@TerriChu) January 25, 2020

As James Palmer wrote in a widely-shared article for Foreign Policy magazine, while many Chinese people have a taste for dishes that seem abhorrent in the West—including exotic and wild animals believed to have medicinal properties, which the government has attempted to clamp down on in recent years—such tastes are hardly the norm. Indeed, as Palmer notes, many inside China joke about the Cantonese dietary habits of eating “everything with four legs save the table and everything that flies but the airplane.”
Regardless, social media users—including commenters on posts by the Mind Unleashed—have been quick to point to groundless rumors, anecdotes, and social media posts to revive decades-old racist tropes about the “bizarre” and “disgusting” diets of Asian and Chinese people, or their supposedly “uncivilized,” “un–evolved,” and “horrible” culture.
Dear the people of China,
Please stop eating bat soup, koalas and hamsters. It’s making us all ill.
Yours sincerely, The rest of the world.#coronarovirus
— Thompson (@thompson_1991) January 25, 2020

But while scientists are still struggling to find a cure for the coronavirus, there is an obvious cure to the shocking revival of anti-Asian discrimination across the West.
Whenever we see inaccurate stories or see racist tropes being trotted out in response to the virus, we should call this out for what it is: blind bigotry and ignorance that can result in tragedy for completely innocent people of Asian descent—including our friends, neighbors, and family members.
This is why people don't take you seriously. ""I, as American, don't eat bats, therefore everyone else who does should stop because I, as an American, dictate the culinary culture of all of the planet."" Your self centered vantage point is myopic and immature.

(TMU) — News of the novel coronavirus and the resulting potentially deadly disease spreading throughout the United States and across the world continues to develop rapidly. According to the map managed by Johns Hopkins, there are now over 101,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and nearly 3,500 deaths worldwide.
Because it can be difficult and overwhelming to keep up, we’ve sifted through hundreds of articles and pulled out what we feel are the most important developments of the last 24 hours so you don’t have to.
Here are five huge developments that you need to know about the global outbreak of COVID-19.
The CDC is reportedly refusing to test a nurse with symptoms that volunteered to assist with COVID-19 patients at a California hospital.
According to the letter posted on Twitter by Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, the CDC claims that she cannot be tested because she was properly protected during her time volunteering.
Really upsetting 🧪- a nurse at CA hospital VOLUNTEERED to work w/ #COVID19, wore proper PPE, and developed symptoms. But then CDC said because she wore PPE — she could NOT be tested! (letter verified). Testing should be for all, especially HCW on front lines. #TESTVIRUSNOW pic.twitter.com/RG4gw0yCwI
— Eric Feigl-Ding (@DrEricDing) March 6, 2020

Meanwhile, Dr. Feigl-Ding said that 22 million Californians are now eligible for free medically necessary COVID-19 testing. However, the example above indicates there still may be a discrepancy when it comes to deciding which situations warrant testing and which ones don’t.
Good news for California: @CAgovernor Newsom, State Health Officials Announce More than 22 Million Californians Now Eligible for Free Medically Necessary #COVID19 Testing- Ie no copay. Great step. Hope other states follow CA, WA, and NY state lead. https://t.co/GTS3TMtY1t

A thread posted to Twitter on Thursday by a man claiming his uncle has tested positive for COVID-19 in California, says that his case is being mismanaged.
My uncle just tested positive for the coronavirus. He lives in Venice, CA. 
I’ve not been in direct contact with him, so we are not at risk from him, but I want to relay how the health department has managed his case. #COVID
— Scott Bell (@iheartWallSt) March 5, 2020

Scott Bell tweeted that his aunt, who is caring for his uncle, had been moving throughout the community before she was eventually quarantined.
A few days later they tested him and yesterday he found out he’s positive. Meanwhile, they’ve told my aunt to wear a mask, stay 10 feet away from my uncle, and otherwise she is free to move about the community. And, she has — to grocery stores, the hair salon, etc. #COVID
— Scott Bell (@iheartWallSt) March 5, 2020

On Thursday, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged that there are not enough COVID-19 tests currently available to meet the demand for them as the outbreak spreads. Pence, who is in charge of national coronavirus response, previously said that “every American can be tested.”
 Pence said: “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward.”
According to the Atlantic, only 1,895 Americans have been tested for the virus and so far roughly 10% tested positive.
Amid the shortage of tests, six U.S. states are not currently testing for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
These states include Alabama, Maine, Ohio, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and Wyoming, according to the CDC. The CDC recently relaxed the requirements needed for people to qualify for testing. 
Researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) have looked at seven outbreak scenarios and how those various scenarios may affect the world’s wealth.
The researcher’s best case scenario predicts a global GDP loss of $2.4 trillion and a death toll of 15 million, according to Business Insider.  
In the worst case scenario, the global death toll could reach a staggering 68 million people.
The Guardian has published before and after photos of typically busy locations throughout the world emptied of people due to the viruses’ spread. 
Bethlehem’s streets appeared empty on Friday with the exception of masked Palestinian police patrolling the area. On Thursday, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas declared a 30-day state of emergency after cases were reported in Bethlehem.
While some cities and countries have put a moratorium on large public gatherings with or without a declared state of emergency, others are operating as normal. Unfortunately in those areas, some people are providing perfect examples as to why some feel moratoriums are the safest route.
It was revealed on Friday that a New Zealand man who has been confirmed to be infected with the virus attended a crowded Tool concert in Auckland on February 28. The man, who is in his 30s, attended the concert only days after returning from northern Italy with his partner who also has COVID-19.
At a news conference, Dr. Ashley Bloomfield, ministry of health director-general of health, said:
“He was in the general admission standing area in the front left-hand quadrant. We encourage people who were in the general admission standing area to be aware of symptoms of COVID-19.”
On Thursday, in what had been the country’s high single-day increase, Italy reported 41 new deaths bringing the country’s total to 148. The total dead has since increased to 197. Italy has the second highest death rate behind that of China.
The first COVID-19 death has been reported in the UK as the number of cases doubled over a 48-hour period as Europe experiences a shortage in medicines and face masks due to disruptions in the supply caused by the novel coronavirus outbreak. Yahoo reports that many countries throughout the world rely on China for both drugs and drug ingredients.
World health officials are warning countries to take the risk of COVID-19 more seriously. In addition to the health risk, CNA reports, “The epidemic has wreaked havoc on international business, tourism, sports events, and schools, with almost 300 million students sent home worldwide.”
Singapore minister and co-head of the country’s virus taskforce, Lawrence Wong, says that the coronavirus is “starting to look like a global pandemic.”
According to the Guardian, a Chinese official visiting Wuhan was heckled by local residents who yelled “fake, fake, everything is fake” as she inspected work related to quarantined residents.
Chinese state media surprisingly reported, rather than censored, videos of this nature. According to a government-affiliated WeChat account, the fakes surrounding the incident were “basically true.“
Also in China, the Chinese outlet that had previously reported the story of a recovered COVID-19 patient who later died after testing negative for the virus and being discharged, removed the report. 
The U.S. state of Indiana has declared a public heath emergency as the Indiana State Department of Health announced a patient who tested positive for COVID-19 in Marion County. According to reports, the person had recently traveled to Boston. 
Indian Governor Holcomb said:
“With the help of our federal, state and local partners, Indiana is responding to this case as we have planned and prepared for weeks. The Hoosier who has been diagnosed has taken responsible steps to stay isolated.”
Additional U.S. states including Colorado, Maryland, and Nevada have reported their first cases of the novel coronavirus. 
U.S. President Donald Trump cancelled his scheduled visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Atlanta headquarters, according to a senior White House official.
Houston has announced the city’s sixth case. May Sylvester Turner said, “There remains no evidence of community spread, no need to alter our normal activity in Houston and certainly no reason to let fear grip our lives.”
The number of people quarantined in New York City continues to increase. According to the New York Times, the city’s Department of Health is monitoring 2,773 people who are currently self-quarantining at home. Most of those being monitored had recently returned from China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan, according to New York City health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot.
The Daily Beast reports that New York City has 22 confirmed cases as of Thursday afternoon, as the city prepares for “mayhem.”
Mayor Bill De Blasio said:
“We are going to see more cases like this as community transmission becomes more common. We want New Yorkers to be prepared and vigilant, not alarmed. We are taking the same decisive steps in every case to shut transmission down: isolate and test each suspected case, trace close contacts, and isolate and test them as well.”
Local Seattle outlet KOMO has confirmed that the area’s first quarantine village will utilize an EconoLodge hotel in Kent, WA. KOMO reports that Seattle and King country will establish three quarantine villages total and that no public announcement has been made thus far.
KOMO’s Matt Markovich said on Twitter:
“I find this very interesting. Media gathering for a tour arrange by King Co at the Econolodge in Kent the new location for a quarantine village for COVID-19 patients but motel employees they have no clue motel’s new purpose. Receptionist didn’t know anything.”

Also in Washington, families of residents at the nursing home at the center of the Seattle-area COVID-19 outbreak are speaking out. During a live press conference, families detailed their varied experiences in receiving contradictory information.

Some families have been told that, despite being quarantined with patients diagnosed with COVID-19, their loved ones would not be tested. Still another was told that their deceased relative died of “natural causes” and would not be tested for COVID-19, despite the outbreak.
Pat Herrick, daughter of a decease resident, said that she was told Thursday morning that her mother had died and was later told that her mother was alive and doing well, before ultimately being told that her mother did in fact die of “natural causes” and was showing no signs of the virus before her death. 
Over 20,000 people have signed an online petition demanding that Lake Washington School District (LWSD) cancel classes amid the outbreak in Washington state. LWSD said in a statement, “School closures can be disruptive and costly for families.”
Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for both Seattle and King County, allegedly asked, “Do we really want to close schools or do we want to keep schools open so faculty can continue to come in and serve children?”
The Northshore School District cancelled classes on Thursday.

“Genius” Doctor Turns One Ventilator Into Nine Using DIY Tips From YouTube Video,"

(TMU) — As health care facilities across the globe continue to grapple with a general shortage of supplies to help them with the devastating coronavirus pandemic, one doctor in Canada has managed to use a bit of creativity, ingenuity, and an idea inspired by YouTube to help future patients.
Dr. Alain Gaithier, an anesthetist at the Perth and Smiths Falls District Hospital in Ontario, was worried about the possibility that his rural hospital’s one ventilator would hardly be able to carry the load that the CoViD-19 outbreak could entail.
So Gauthier, who has a Ph. D. in respiratory mechanics, borrowed an idea conceived by American doctors Greg Neyman and Charlene Babcock in 2006 to double the capacity of a single ventilator. According to CBC the idea was tested successfully following the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting. Babcock eventually created a how-to video explaining how the DIY “upgrade” works.
In just ten minutes, Gauthier used extra tubing to double the number of patients that could be ventilated at the hospital.
The way the system works is that the two patients simultaneously connected to the ventilator must be roughly the same size and with the same lung capacity. Multiple hoses are then attached to the one ventilator, which is then run at several times its normal power.
While imperfect, Gauthier said that “if it comes to last resort, I’m prepared to use it.”
Gauthier’s colleague, Alan Drummond, excitedly shared images of the rigged ventilator on Twitter, jokingly calling Gauthier “an evil genius.” He wrote:
“So in ten minutes the evil genius who is one of our GP anesthetists (with a PhD in diaphragmatic mechanics) increased our rural hospitals ventilator capacity from one to nine!!!”

Drummond, an emergency physician at the hospital, also said that he broke social distancing protocol to give his colleague a big hug.
Even billionaire tycoon Elon Musk expressed his admiration at Gauthier’s efforts, commenting in a the tweet that it was an “interesting thread.” 
Continuing, Musk noted that perhaps it could one day lead to a more effective system to ensure that patients breathe. He added:
“A single computer, pump & pressure accumulator would be fine for many patients, but ideally individual valves per patient to personalize care & avoid cross-flow risk.”

However, for Gauthier his newfound fame is the last thing that concerns him in a rural region where many of the 60,000 people served by the hospital are older or have such conditions as diabetes and chronic pulmonary disease.
He also doesn’t want credit for his invention.
“A lot of work is being done by pretty much everyone,” he stressed.
Like many health care systems struggling with the outbreak, Gauthier and his coworkers worry that they soon may be forced to choose which critical patients receive a ventilator and which are simply allowed to die—a dilemma that he hopes to avoid with his Gerry-rigged system.
“We are concerned, we’re trying to get ready as much as possible,” Gauthier said.

(TMU) — The city of San Francisco, California, has declared a state of emergency in response to the growing COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. On Tuesday, San Francisco Mayor London Breed announced the city is going to start preparing now as the “global picture is changing rapidly.”
“We see the virus spreading in new parts of the world every day, and we are taking the necessary steps to protect San Franciscans from harm,” Mayor Breed said.

While there have been no confirmed cases in San Francisco, the move comes after a day of press conferences from various agencies that gave mixed messages in regards to recommended responses to the outbreak
Nancy Messonier, director of the CDC’s National Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a statement:
“As more and more countries experience community spread, successful containment at our borders becomes harder and harder. It’s not a question of if this will happen but when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illnesses.”
She added, “disruption to everyday life might be severe.”
The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) recommended taking a more of a “wait and see” approach during their Tuesday press conference.
HHS Secretary Alex Azar said:
“The immediate risk to the general American public remains low, but that has the potential to change quickly.”
“Part of preparedness is an educated population thinking about the future,” he added.
Harvard University epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch has predicted in an interview with the Atlantic that the virus will eventually infect somewhere between 40 and 70 percent of the entire world, because it has now become “uncontainable.” However, Lipsitch does not believe that the virus will be deadly to all of these people because some cases will be mild or asymptomatic.
A case study published this week by Chinese researchers in the journal JAMA has shown that a 20-year-old woman from Wuhan passed the illness on to five of her family members but never became sick herself—so it appears that it possible for someone to transmit the virus without showing symptoms. To make matters even more confusing, the young woman initially tested negative for the illness before testing positive days later.

Biden is Reportedly Weighing Billionaires Michael Bloomberg and JPMorgan Chase CEO for Cabinet Posts,"

(CD) – Joe Biden is reportedly considering appointing businessman Michael Bloomberg and JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, both billionaires, to powerful leadership positions should Biden win the Democratic presidential nomination and defeat President Donald Trump in November.
Axios reported Monday that the former vice president and his campaign advisers are weighing Dimon for treasury secretary, a cabinet position tasked with overseeing the U.S. financial system. Biden is also considering Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bank of America vice chair Anne Finucane for the top Treasury post.
Bloomberg, who dropped out of the presidential race last week and immediately endorsed Biden, “would be top possibility to head the World Bank” under a Biden administration, according to Axios.
Progressive observers were appalled, if not surprised, by the preliminary list of potential Biden appointees, which Axios reported just 24 hours before Democratic primary contests in six states.
“This shouldn’t surprise anyone. This is who the Dem Party is,” tweeted Glenn Greenwald, co-founder of The Intercept. “The establishment wing of the party didn’t fall into line behind Biden despite the fact that he’d put Bloomberg and Jamie Dimon in his cabinet. They did it because of that. This is who they are, their ideology.”
Sarah Jones, a writer for New York Magazine, tweeted that “probably the highest expectation anyone should have for a Biden presidency is that he’d be a caretaker president.”
“The worst,” Jones added, “is that he’d empower people like Bloomberg and Dimon and actively make the U.S. a worse place than it was when Trump was elected.”
Congratulations to Biden. This is worse than Hillary’s rumored shortlist in 2016 https://t.co/ktOBdAxwDe pic.twitter.com/97vPZ4hcy0
— Sarah Jones (@onesarahjones) March 9, 2020

Biden advisers told Axios that the former vice president’s cabinet picks would be tasked with implementing “a Return to Normal plan—a reversal of President Trump’s unorthodox, improvisational style.”
“Biden wants known, trusted people around him—many from the Obama years,” Axios reported.
Critics, including members of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign, said the list of potential appointees is further evidence that Biden, if elected, plans to make good on his promise to wealthy donors last June that “nothing would fundamentally change” under his presidency.
“This is maybe the most depressing thing you’ll read all day,” tweeted Tyson Brody, research director for the Sanders campaign. “Imagine after all this just to make Jamie Dimon treasury secretary. Not only would ‘nothing fundamentally change,’ things can be even worse for working people.”
Warren Gunnels, senior adviser to Sanders, highlighted Dimon’s role in the 2008 financial crisis as CEO of JPMorgan Chase and board member of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York:
Aw man, Are you kidding me?
Biden is measuring the White House drapes by floating Jamie Dimon as Treasury Secretary.
He’s the CEO of a bank that:
– got a $416B bailout while he was on the NY Fed
– was fined $13B for mortgage fraud
– illegally foreclosed on military families https://t.co/4iT6ZE8NuA
— Warren Gunnels (@GunnelsWarren) March 9, 2020

Pointing to growing fears of a global financial meltdown as the coronavirus spreads globally, academic and writer Josh Mound tweeted that “Biden floating Dimon, Finucane, and Bloomberg for major economic positions just as the economy teeters on the edge of collapse for the second time in roughly a decade tells you all you need to know about the utter hopelessness of the mainstream of the Democratic Party.”
Progressive advocacy group Democracy for America, which endorsed Sanders for president last week, echoed Mound.
“The fact that Joe Biden’s advisers, when musing about cabinet picks, are debating between Elizabeth Warren, Jamie Dimon, and a Bank of America exec for treasury secretary pretty much tells you all you need to know about Joe’s non-existent commitment to a progressive agenda,” the group said.

“Biggest Lockdown in World History”: India Paralyzed as COVID-19 Crisis Unfolds,"



Facebook

(ZH) — Indian stocks crashed on Monday, suffering their worst single-day loss on record, as domestic and foreign investors were absolutely terrified that a nationwide lockdown triggered by a COVID-19 outbreak could crash the economy.
The NIFTY 50 is the flagship index on the National Stock Exchange of India, plummeted 12.98% to a near four-year low of 7,610.25 on Monday.

The Indian rupee hit a record low of over 76 against the dollar and puts pressure on the Narendra Modi government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ramp up emergency response efforts to protect a crashing currency and economy.

Modi’s “Make-in-India” program, an attempt to revive the economy and diversify its manufacturing sector away from automobiles to bolster its aerospace and defense sectors, has miserably failed.
The economy has come to a screeching halt as residents in 75 districts across the country, including in major cities, such as the capital New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore have been forced into mandatory quarantine by the government until March 31.

India is the second-largest country in the world, and has reported only 467 cases and ten deaths.
The lack of test kits has made it virtually impossible for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to detect community spreading of the virus. As test kits come online, India could be staring at a pandemic.
Actions by the government already suggest the virus crisis is getting worse. In the last day, India launched the world’s most extensive social distancing lockdown of 1.3 billion people to flatten the pandemic curve to slow down the infection rate.
Nearly a billion Indians stayed indoors on Sunday.

Flight bans and the cancellation of all passenger trains in the country is another attempt to limit the spread. The country’s hospital system is poorly equipped and doesn’t have enough hospital beds and ICU-level treatments to handle a massive influx of virus patients.
“This is the biggest lockdown in world history,” said Raghu Raman, a former soldier with the Indian Army and founder of the National Intelligence Grid, an umbrella database aimed at countering terrorism.
“This strategic pause gives decision-makers more time to arrest the exponential spread of the virus and evaluate tradeoffs.”
Foreign investors aren’t sticking around to see if the virus crisis will abate in the near term – they’re currently dumping Indian assets at an unprecedented pace.

Oxford Economics estimates India’s January-April growth forecast to be around 3%, a level not seen since the global financial crisis.
Bloomberg Economics says that the Indian government needs to spend at least 1% of GDP, or about $30 billion, to respond to the virus outbreak.
India’s manufacturing hubs have ground to a halt as companies have been forced to shutter operations for virus containment purposes. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., Tata Motors Ltd., Toyota Kirloskar Motor, Hero MotoCorp., Samsung Electronics Co. and LG Electronics Inc., Mahindra Group, TVS Motor Co., Kia Motors Corp., Renault Nissan Automotive India Private Ltd., and Yamaha Motor India are some of the large multinationals that have recently suspended operations.
The government’s principal economic adviser Sanjeev Sanyal warned that “waves of default” of corporate debt could be imminent. There’s a record 5.9 trillion rupees of corporate debt maturing this year.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said last week that the government would announce a relief package for companies in the near term. The RBI is expected to slash interest rates and inject 1 trillion rupees into the economy on April 3.
We noted back in December that India’s economy was “in a very deep crisis,” which was a month before the world figured out about a virus outbreak in Wuhan, China. 
It was only earlier this month that India organized a rescue plan for the nation’s fourth-largest private bank as a long-running crisis among shadow lenders threatened to spill over into the banking system.
With a nationwide lockdown underway, India’s economy could be on the brink of a significant downturn that would be absolutely devastating for the Modi government.

This is a Test: How Will the Constitution Fare During a Nationwide Lockdown?,"

(TRI Opinion) – This is a test.
This is not a test of our commitment to basic hygiene or disaster preparedness or our ability to come together as a nation in times of crisis, although we’re not doing so well on any of those fronts.
No, what is about to unfold over the next few weeks is a test to see how well we have assimilated the government’s lessons in compliance, fear and police state tactics; a test to see how quickly we’ll march in lockstep with the government’s dictates, no questions asked; and a test to see how little resistance we offer up to the government’s power grabs when made in the name of national security.
Most critically of all, this is a test to see whether the Constitution—and our commitment to the principles enshrined in the Bill of Rights—can survive a national crisis and true state of emergency.
“It takes a remarkable force to keep nearly a million people quietly indoors for an entire day, home from work and school, from neighborhood errands and out-of-town travel. It takes a remarkable force to keep businesses closed and cars off the road, to keep playgrounds empty and porches unused across a densely populated place 125 square miles in size. This happened … not because armed officers went door-to-door, or imposed a curfew, or threatened martial law. All around the region, for 13 hours, people locked up their businesses and ‘sheltered in place’ out of a kind of collective will. The force that kept them there wasn’t external – there was virtually no active enforcement across the city of the governor’s plea that people stay indoors. Rather, the pressure was an internal one – expressed as concern, or helpfulness, or in some cases, fear – felt in thousands of individual homes.”—Journalist Emily Badger, “The Psychology of a Citywide Lockdown”
Here’s what we know: whatever the so-called threat to the nation—whether it’s civil unrest, school shootings, alleged acts of terrorism, or the threat of a global pandemic in the case of COVID-19—the government has a tendency to capitalize on the nation’s heightened emotions, confusion and fear as a means of extending the reach of the police state.
This coronavirus epidemic, which has brought China’s Orwellian surveillance out of the shadows and caused Italy to declare a nationwide lockdown, threatens to bring the American Police State out into the open on a scale we’ve not seen before.
If and when a nationwide lockdown finally hits—if and when we are forced to shelter in place— if and when militarized police are patrolling the streets— if and when security checkpoints have been established— if and when the media’s ability to broadcast the news has been curtailed by government censors—if and when public systems of communication (phone lines, internet, text messaging, etc.) have been restricted—if and when those FEMA camps the government has been surreptitiously building finally get used as quarantine detention centers for American citizens—if and when military “snatch and grab” teams are deployed on local, state, and federal levels as part of the activated Continuity of Government plans to isolate anyone suspected of being infected with COVID-19—and if and when martial law is enacted with little real outcry or resistance from the public—then we will truly understand the extent to which the government has fully succeeded in recalibrating our general distaste for anything that smacks too overtly of tyranny.
This is how it begins.
The coronavirus epidemic may well be a legitimate health concern, but it’s the government’s response to it that worries me more in the long term.
Based on the government’s track record and its long-anticipated plans for instituting martial law (using armed forces to solve domestic political and social problems) in response to a future crisis, there’s good reason to worry.
This is not a government with a rosy view of the future.
To the contrary, the government’s vision of the future is particularly ominous if a Pentagon training video created by the Army for U.S. Special Operations Command is anything to go by.
Obtained by The Intercept through a FOIA request, the training video titled “Megacities: Urban Future, the Emerging Complexity” provides a chilling glimpse of what the government expects the world to look like in 2030, a world bedeviled by “criminal networks,” “substandard infrastructure,” “religious and ethnic tensions,” “impoverishment, slums,” “open landfills, over-burdened sewers,” a “growing mass of unemployed,” and an urban landscape in which the prosperous economic elite must be protected from the impoverishment of the have nots.
Add health contagions to the mix, and we’re arrived there, ten years ahead of schedule.
The training video is only five minutes long, but it says a lot about the government’s mindset and the way its views the citizenry. Even more troubling, however, is what this military video doesn’t say about the Constitution and the rights of the citizenry: nothing at all.
In typical fashion, the government seems to consider the Constitution only when forced to do so. It complies with the dictates of the Constitution even less frequently. Indeed, the government’s efforts to systematically lock down the nation and shift us into martial law have not been stymied one iota by the restraints imposed upon it by the Constitution: when it’s not bulldozing its way through the Fourth Amendment, the government just sidesteps it (with the help of the courts).
So what should you expect if the government decides to declare a national state of emergency and institute a nationwide lockdown?
More of the same of what we’ve been seeing in recent years.
After all, like the proverbial boiling frogs, the government has been gradually acclimating us to the specter of a police state for years now: Militarized police. Riot squads. Camouflage gear. Black uniforms. Armored vehicles. Mass arrests. Pepper spray. Tear gas. Batons. Strip searches. Surveillance cameras. Kevlar vests. Drones. Lethal weapons. Less-than-lethal weapons unleashed with deadly force. Rubber bullets. Water cannons. Stun grenades. Arrests of journalists. Crowd control tactics. Intimidation tactics. Brutality.
This is how you prepare a populace to accept a police state willingly, even gratefully.
You don’t scare them by making dramatic changes. Rather, you acclimate them slowly to their prison walls. Persuade the citizenry that their prison walls are merely intended to keep them safe and danger out. Desensitize them to violence, acclimate them to a military presence in their communities, and persuade them that only a militarized government can alter the seemingly hopeless trajectory of the nation.
It’s happening already.
The sight of police clad in body armor and gas masks, wielding semiautomatic rifles and escorting an armored vehicle through a crowded street, a scene likened to “a military patrol through a hostile city,” no longer causes alarm among the general populace.
We’ve allowed ourselves to be acclimated to the occasional lockdown of government buildings, Jade Helm military drills in small towns so that special operations forces can get “realistic military training” in “hostile” territory, and  Live Active Shooter Drill training exercises, carried out at schools, in shopping malls, and on public transit, which can and do fool law enforcement officials, students, teachers and bystanders into thinking it’s a real crisis.
Still, you can’t say we weren’t warned.
Back in 2008, an Army War College report revealed that “widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security.” The 44-page report went on to warn that potential causes for such civil unrest could include another terrorist attack, “unforeseen economic collapse, loss of functioning political and legal order, purposeful domestic resistance or insurgency, pervasive public health emergencies, and catastrophic natural and human disasters.”
In 2009, reports by the Department of Homeland Security surfaced that called on the government to subject right-wing and left-wing activists and military veterans to full-fledged pre-crime surveillance.
Meanwhile, the government has been amassing an arsenal of military weapons, including hollow point bullets, for use domestically and equipping and training their “troops” for war. Even government agencies with largely administrative functions such as the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Smithsonian have been acquiring body armor, riot helmets and shields, cannon launchers and police firearms and ammunition. In fact, there are now at least 120,000 armed federal agents carrying such weapons who possess the power to arrest.
Rounding out this profit-driven campaign to turn American citizens into enemy combatants (and America into a battlefield) is a technology sector that has been colluding with the government to create a Big Brother that is all-knowing, all-seeing and inescapable. It’s not just the drones, fusion centers, license plate readers, stingray devices and the NSA that you have to worry about. You’re also being tracked by the black boxes in your cars, your cell phone, smart devices in your home, grocery loyalty cards, social media accounts, credit cards, streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon, and e-book reader accounts.
All of this has taken place right under our noses, funded with our taxpayer dollars and carried out in broad daylight without so much as a general outcry from the citizenry.
And then you have the government’s Machiavellian schemes for unleashing all manner of dangers on an unsuspecting populace, then demanding additional powers in order to protect “we the people” from the threats. Almost every national security threat that the government has claimed greater powers in order to fight—all the while undermining the liberties of the American citizenry—has been manufactured in one way or another by the government.
We have made it way too easy for the government to lockdown the nation.
Consider that it was seven years ago when the city of Boston was locked down while police carried out a military-style manhunt for suspects in the 2013 Boston Marathon explosion.
Six years ago, the city of Ferguson, Missouri, was locked down, with government officials deploying a massive SWAT team, an armored personnel carrier, men in camouflage pointing heavy artillery at the crowd, smoke bombs and tear gas to quell citizen unrest over a police shooting of a young, unarmed black man.
Five years ago, the city of Baltimore was put under a military-enforced lockdown after civil unrest over police brutality erupted into rioting. More than 1,500 national guard troops were deployed while residents were ordered to stay inside their homes and put under a 10 pm curfew.
Three years ago, it was Charlottesville, Va., population 50,000, that was locked down while government officials declared a state of emergency and enacted heightened security measures tantamount to martial law, despite the absence of any publicized information about credible threats to public safety.
Fast forward to the present moment, with the world on the verge of a possible coronavirus pandemic, and growing numbers of Americans are already voluntarily sheltering in place in an effort to avoid falling ill.
For those like myself who have studied emerging police states, the sight of any American city placed under martial law—its citizens essentially under house arrest (officials used the Orwellian phrase “shelter in place” in Boston to describe the mandatory lockdown), military-style helicopters equipped with thermal imaging devices buzzing the skies, tanks and armored vehicles on the streets, and snipers perched on rooftops, while thousands of black-garbed police swarmed the streets and SWAT teams carried out house-to-house searches—leaves us in a growing state of unease.
Watching the events of the various lockdowns unfold, I couldn’t help but think of Nazi Field Marshal Hermann Goering’s remarks during the Nuremberg trials. As Goering noted:
It is always a simple matter to drag people along whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.
It does indeed work the same in every country.
Unfortunately, it doesn’t take much for the American people to be terrorized into compliance by the government’s latest and greatest scare tactic, even if it means being stripped of one’s constitutional rights at a moment’s notice.
This continual undermining of the rules that protect civil liberties has far-reaching consequences on a populace that not only remains ignorant about their rights but is inclined to sacrifice their liberties for phantom promises of safety.
It may be that we’ve already gone too far down this road. However, don’t let this latest “crisis” cause you to panic to such an extent that you relinquish your fundamental right to make decisions for yourself and your loved ones and willingly surrender what remains of your freedoms.
This too shall pass.
Remember, a police state does not come about overnight.
Yet as I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, no matter how it starts, with a questionable infringement justified in the name of safety or a nationwide lockdown to guard against a global pandemic, it always ends the same: by pushing us one step closer to a future in which the government has all the power and “we the people” have none.

First Dog in Hong Kong That Was Quarantined for COVID-19 Has Died,"

(TMU) — The first dog to test positive for the coronavirus has died in Hong Kong after apparently recovering from the disease, according to South China Morning Post.
The dog, a 17-year-old Pomeranian, passed away on Monday after being returned to its owner following a government quarantine and a negative test for the virus. However, officials said this wasn’t conclusive evidence that the dog was no longer infected.
“It is known in some asymptomatic or mild cases of human infections with other types of coronavirus that antibodies may not always develop,” the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) told SCMP.
The Pomeranian belonged to a 60-year-old woman who recovered from the virus. The woman refused to allow the AFCD to conduct an autopsy on her pet.
“The department learned from the dog’s owner that it had passed away on March 16,” the department said in a statement. “The owner said she was not willing to [allow] an autopsy to examine the cause of death.”
A previous statement stressed that the dog had not shown any symptoms and there was no evidence at the time that pets could either contract coronavirus or pass it on to people, the South China Morning Post reported.
The World Health Organization (WHO) also confirmed the case stating that swabs of its nasal and oral cavities tested “weak positive,” CNBC reported.
The World Small Animal Veterinary Association earlier this month said it was highly unlikely owners could contract coronavirus from their dog or cat, or that their companion animal could transmit the virus to people or other animals.
“Currently there is no evidence that pets or other domestic animals can be infected with this new coronavirus,” the WSAVA’s official guidance says.
“Additionally, there is currently no evidence that pets or other domestic animals might be a source of infection to people with the new coronavirus. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.”
China has been burning dead animal carcasses with 40 new mobile incinerators deployed to Wuhan. Chinese officials are also said to be beating dogs and cats to death according to a report by Daily Mail which included a distressing and disturbing video.
Further, more than 100 wild animals were found dead in a Chinese megacity and tests show that they were poisoned by the disinfectant that’s being used to combat the coronavirus according to Business Insider.
Chinese pet owners have been flocking to buy face masks for their dogs amid the coronavirus outbreak to prevent them from catching the disease, Daily Mail reported. China’s top expert for infectious diseases previously warned that pets might also be infected by the novel coronavirus.
Prof. Li told state broadcaster CCTV:
“In this epidemic season, pet owners should strengthen their management of their pets.
If your dogs run around outside and come to contact with the outbreak or people infected with the virus, then your pets should also be put in quarantine.
Because the epidemic spreads between mammals, therefore we should take precaution against other mammals.”
This has resulted in Chinese citizens killing their pets, throwing them from buildings and abandoning them, according to reports.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests pet owners should restrict contact with pets and other animals if the owner is infected with CoViD-19. That includes “petting, snuggling, being kissed or licked, and sharing food.”

(TMU) — The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has announced the first case of the deadly Wuhan coronavirus in the United States. The mysterious illness already has sickened hundreds of people and killed six in China.
According to CNN, a man in Washington state has been isolated at the Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett, Washington “out of caution.” Officials say the healthy man in his 30s “poses little risk” to the public. The CDC noted that the patient is currently in good condition but being monitored for additional symptoms. It is unclear if the man transmitted the virus to anyone else in the United States. Reports suggest the man had recently traveled from Wuhan to the U.S. and reached out to health officials on January 15 after experiencing pneumonia-like symptoms.
Initial symptoms of the virus include—fever, cough, tightness of the chest, and shortness of breath. However, some infected individuals have reported sporadic symptoms.
Prior to the incident, the CDC had recently expressed that the probability of the virus spreading to the U.S. was “low.” However, “proactive preparedness precautions” were underway.
The outbreak has been reported in five countries in addition to China—Thailand, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and now the United States.

Some say China may not be telling the full truth about the outbreak that has scientists baffled.
Posted by The Mind Unleashed on Tuesday, January 21, 2020
The WHO stated on Twitter in an informational thread:
The rate of the outbreak has begun to worry experts. Observers are concerned the Chinese government may not be telling the full truth of the outbreak. Scientists with the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College in London are warning that the true number of those infected is likely far higher than what is officially being acknowledged.
Airports all over the world—including those in major U.S. cities like San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles—are proceeding with the screening of travelers from Wuhan as fears of a global pandemic have been raised. Today, the CDC has said it has added, two additional U.S. airports: Atlanta and Chicago O’Hare, NBC reported.
The CDC is sending 100 staffers to aid in screenings at major airports.
There have also been reports of domestic flights in Wuhan being scanned for the virus by medical personnel in hazmat suits according to video posted by Yahoo News.
The CDC’s recommended preventive measures include washing hands with soap and water; avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth; and keeping away from sick people. Seek immediate medical attention if you suspect you are infected with the Wuhan coronavirus.

WHO Now Warns Coronavirus is “Enemy Number 1” and More Powerful Than Terrorism,"

(TMU) — The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday named the novel coronavirus that has killed at least 1,017 people in China while sickening 43,000 more. The organization also warned that the virus is “public enemy number one.”
The new coronavirus has officially been given a “pronounceable” name “related to the disease,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. The novel coronavirus is now called COVID-19, having been previously referred to as simply Wuhan, for the Chinese city in which it originated, as well as 2019-nCoV.
According to officials, the “CO” is for coronavirus, the “VI” is for virus, the “D” is for disease, and the “19” is for the year in which it was first detected.
“Having a name matters to prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing,” Tedros said. “It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus outbreaks.”
WHO reports that the first vaccine for what the organization is calling a global threat worse than terrorism could be 18 months away.
Speaking of the threat posted by COVID-19, Tedros said, “To be honest, a virus is more powerful in creating political, economic and social upheaval than any terrorist attack.”
“A virus can have more powerful consequences than any terrorist action.
If the world doesn’t want to wake up and consider this enemy virus as public enemy number one, I don’t think we will learn from our lessons.”
The virus has so far been confirmed in 24 countries and territories outside of mainland China. Tedros expressed concerns that the virus could “create havoc” in countries that are ill prepared to fight it.
“With 99 per cent of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,” Tedros said.

The infectious respiratory illness is a new strain of coronavirus that is causing a type of pneumonia. Some experts have compared it to SARS because it is also a coronavirus. Scientists have examined the genetic code of the new virus and have found that it is more closely related to SARS than any other human coronavirus.
The illness is said to have originated in a seafood market in Wuhan and quickly spread to other areas of China, then Japan, Thailand, South Korea, and the United States.

Soon after the first case was reported in the U.S., the Chinese government made the call to quarantine the city of Wuhan.
Wuhan’s 11 million residents will be trapped in the city until further notice unless they receive special permission to leave after an intense screening process.
While hundreds of cases have been officially reported, experts fear that there may actually be thousands who are infected by now. At least 17 people have died from the illness. Prior to the quarantine of Wuhan the government was actively censoring news about the outbreak. They also deleted social media posts that contradicted official statements on the matter.

Some say China may not be telling the full truth about the outbreak that has some scientists baffled.

In light of their mismanagement of the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003, China is under intense international scrutiny about the outbreak. The Chinese government was accused of attempting to cover up the severity of the SARS outbreak when it initially occurred.
Residents of the affected areas are being advised to avoid “unprotected” contact with live animals. They are also being advised to thoroughly cook meat and eggs as well as avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms

(TMU) — Spanish police are taking a page out of China’s Orwellian playbook by using drones to patrol and yell at their civilians who are disobeying the CoViD-19 quarantine.
The country issued a state of emergency on Friday, and on Saturday the government ordered everyone in the country to stay home for all but the most crucial trips outdoors, according to Business Insider. Now, much like China did earlier this year, Spanish police are using drones to demand that citizens stay indoors without having to approach them and risk spreading the virus.

Video from the BBC shows police speaking into a radio and urging people walking through a Madrid park to go home. That message is then relayed into a drone utilizing a loudspeaker flying overhead demanding Spain’s citizens quarantine themselves inside their homes.
In Spain, all schools, restaurants, bars, sports venues, and cultural centers have been ordered closed, and social gatherings are also forbidden under declaration of a National Emergency. Spain has been one of Europe’s hardest hit countries, after Italy, with a death total of 509 deaths and 11,000 cases of infections according to Johns Hopkins map at the time of this report.
Most of Spain’s cases have been recorded in the Madrid region, according to the Spanish Health Ministry.
“We won’t hesitate to use all the measures we have at our disposal to look out for your safety and everyone’s safety,” the city’s police department said on Twitter. “Although some of you will give us a hard time.”
Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sanchez called for unity and cooperation announcing the new measures to combat the CoViD-19 virus, the Independent reported.

“I want to tell the workers, the self-employed and businesses that the government of Spain is going to do everything in its power to cushion the effects of this crisis,” Sanchez said. “Spain is demonstrating in these critical hours that it has the capacity to overcome adversity.”
“We are facing very difficult weeks of efforts and sacrifices. Some important rights must be limited if we want to beat the virus,” Sanchez also said.
Those who break the rules of the quarantine in Spain can be fined up to €600,000 and face prison time for their negligence.
The state of emergency will last two weeks, though may be extended if the situations warrants.
