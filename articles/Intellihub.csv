Homeless being rounded up and taken to camps amid coronavirus outbreak,"SEATAC (INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî King County officials announced on Saturday a plan to take homeless to the old arrivals section at Boeing Field against everything America stands for.
Under the current national state of emergency declaration snatch and grabs of American citizens have been authorized at the highest levels in an effort to mitigate the spread of the deadly Covid-19 Contagion.
Authorities have been ordered to use force if necessary to carry out quarantine orders.
From the Seattle Times:
The two quarantine or isolation properties are the¬†Eastgate parking lot in Bellevue and a motel in Issaquah the county just leased.
City and county officials have scrambled to open up new space to create social distancing in crowded shelters, which house a vulnerable population at risk of contracting severe COVID-19 illnesses. Officials anticipate ‚Äúhundreds or thousands‚Äù of people needing to use quarantine facilities in the coming weeks who cannot isolate at home or do not have homes of their own, according to King County Leo Flor, director of the county‚Äôs Department of Community and Human Services.
Keep in mind, homeless are not the only humans authorized to be detained. If you think you are immune to the order that you may have another thing coming.
Under the current national state of emergency, anyone in violation of a quarantine order will receive a $250,000 fine and mandatory imprisonment. So you may want to think twice about leaving your home during the zombie apocalypse once the U.S. military begins to enforce it.
And if that is not bad enough, being taken to a camp with the infected would surely mean a horrible death. Remember, officials have been lying about the kill rate which seems to be about 16% in Washington State.
Meanwhile, in Austin, Texas local authorities have openly admitted that the violation of a quarantine order equals jail time.
On a local level: ‚ÄúState law allows local health authorities to issue the orders ‚Äî which include criminal charges and fines. The Texas Health and Safety Code shows a violation of an order is punishable by up to six months in jail and a $2,000 fine. The crime is a Class B misdemeanor.,‚Äù according to a report posted on KXAN.com.
The National Guard is currently positioning throughout Washington State ahead of quarantine lockdown. The following convoy was deployed out of Fort Lewis.

National Guard arrives New Rochelle to ‚Äúcontain‚Äù coronavirus cluster,"WESTCHESTER CO. (INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî ¬†U.S. national Guard troops began to arrive in New Rochelle during the wee hours of the morning on Thursday in an attempt to contain the deadly SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus contagion which has been proven to be able to survive in the air for three hours.

Withal, it appears that the U.S. military may actually be prepositioning to take the Bronx and Manhattan into hot martial law and may not actually be focusing on the city of New Rochelle as officials claim. (i.e.¬†The brunt of the cluster may not be in New Rochelle but rather in Manhattan and the Bronx)

If the military uses New Rochelle as a staging area it would make it easy for them to quarantine the Bronx and Manhattan by just sealing off several major roadways which would ultimately limit all traffic and pedestrian flow in and out of the vicinity.
Is the current 1-mile ‚Äúcontainment zone‚Äù in New Rochelle just a staging point for the U.S. military to full quarantine and take Manhattan and the Bronx into all-out martial law?

Official COVID-19 death rates are currently being underreported by government agencies and the media in an effort to keep¬†public panic to a minimum as the virus continues to silently infect Americans in nearly all states.
A good example of such deception can be found within the death rate at the Kirkland, Washington LifeCare facility which as of Saturday had reached a staggering 22% +/- and still rising but you won‚Äôt hear any of this reported on the nightly news. That‚Äôs a total of 26 deaths as of Saturday.
26 people have died from the Kirkland LifeCare facility alone! Wake up! #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/n8amdu9ukI
‚Äî Shepard Ambellas (@ShepardAmbellas) March 8, 2020

The CDC reports¬†that a total of 48 states now have testing capabilities. However, the testing of suspected cases remains flawed and limited which can only be seen as a last-ditch attempt by the government to stall panic as the virus begins to bloom.
Additionally, official test results are now only being released only once a week as opposed to daily. This means that on any given Friday the situation has the potential to come to a head and proverbially explode.
The CDC currently reports 164 U.S. cases between 19 states and 11 deaths. However, there were 26 dead as of Saturday at LifeCare of Kirkland alone, according to information obtained by Intellihub.
Moreover, the virus has a confirmed 23-27 day incubation period yet the CDC is only mandating a 14-day isolation period allowing for sustained human-to-human spread.
The CDC currently reports the global mortality rate to be 3.4%.
This all goes to show that the mainstream media and the White House can simply not be trusted.

FEMA prepares for complete and total takeover of society and infrastructure...,"(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî It is mainstream news that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has been preparing for President Donald Trump‚Äôs imminent declaration of a coronavirus state of emergency as SARS-CoV-2 continues to infect more and more people along the West Coast and other areas of the Continental United States (CONUS) with the highly contagious and deadly disease termed COVID-19 which tends to¬†act nothing like the common flu as officials are claiming.
FEMA plans to act in the event that the president declares a national emergency in what would be an all-out attempt to mitigate and contain and contain the spread of the coronavirus.
What will happen if the president declares a national ‚Äôemergency‚Äô due to the coronavirus?
If President Donald Trump were to declare a national emergency due to the coronavirus it will put FEMA, referred to as ‚Äúthe secret government‚Äù by some, at the helm of the country and will essentially suspend the U.S. constitution altogether under enacted executive orders.
Several Executive Orders that would suspend the U.S. Constitution are as follows, via dmc.members.sonic.net:
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare functions.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in U.S. financial institution in any undefined national emergency. It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months.

A Seattle woman confirms the same thing‚Ä¶
I live in Seattle, I have all symptoms of COVID-19 and have a history of chronic bronchitis. 
Since I work in a physical therapy clinic with many 65+ patients and those with chronic illnesses, I decided to be responsible and go to get tested. This is how that went.
‚Äî sketchy lady (@into_the_brush) March 3, 2020

Twitter user @into_the_brush recalls the tragedy‚Ä¶
I called the Corona hotline, was on hold for 40 minutes and gave up,‚Äù she explains in the Tweet‚Äôs comment section. ‚ÄúSo I looked at the CDC and Washington public health websites. They told me to see a primary care doctor, but there‚Äôs no information about testing.‚Äù
I called 2 primary care doctors. One told me they don‚Äôt know where to get testing, and that I should not to seek out testing. The other one told me to go to an urgent care or ER.
I called the Urgent Care, they also had no idea where tests are, but told me to call the hospital.
I called the hospital. They do not have tests, but transferred me to the COVID-19 hotline to ‚Äúanswer my questions‚Äù. Since I was transferred on a medical provider line, I actually got through. Progress!
The lady with the hotline was very kind and professional and understood my concern about my own health and those at my clinic. (Which is currently being sanitized). However, I was told I do not qualify for testing. And I was not given a timeline or info on current resources.
So. Who does qualify? Those who have been out of the country in the last 14 days, and those who have had contact with one of the few people who have been tested and come up positive. That‚Äôs it.
The only way I can get treated is if my symptoms get so bad I develop pneumonia or bronchitis, which is very likely in my case. Then I‚Äôll be in the ER and quarantined for several days while waiting for a test and for the results to come back.
This is all incredibly frustrating because I am trying to do everything right in a system that punishes moments of ‚Äúweakness‚Äù like taking days off. It‚Äôs also scary to know that I won‚Äôt be able to get help until I need life support.
To sum up: this is not contained. No one knows what the fuck is happening. I can‚Äôt work. WASH YOUR FUCKING HANDS.
‚Ä¶
Since this is getting attention. COVID-19 HOTLINE: 1-800-525-0127 DON‚ÄôT CALL unless you are experiencing all symptoms or have been exposed to a case. Leave the lines open to people who need it most. Any other questions can be answered on the CDC, WHO, or WA public health sites.

As the wild swings in US equity futures over the last few hours would suggest, we‚Äôre headed for another insane week of coronavirus news as America comes to grips with the outbreak as it claims a second life and spreads to the country‚Äôs largest city.
The American coronavirus outbreak accelerated rapidly over the weekend, as health officials confirmed the first virus-linked death on Saturday, before confirming a second death of a US citizen ‚Äì this time a 70-year-old man ‚Äì in the same area of Washington State.

As we explained last night, state and federal public-health officials are focusing on what appears to be a cluster of confirmed cases in Washington, where both deaths have occurred, as well as outbreaks in Oregon and California where patients had no clear path of transmission for the virus, leading officials to suspect that a more widespread outbreak has already begun. Late Sunday night, Gov. Cuomo confirmed the first case in Manhattan, involving a woman who had recently traveled to Iran. The news followed a seemingly unceasing stream of scares and negative tests in America‚Äôs largest city, according to the New York Times. 
As we pointed out, the global death toll climbed above 3,000 last night as China reported another 42 deaths.
‚ÄúCoronavirus Czar‚Äù and Vice President Mike Pence reiterated promises to make more testing kits available to state officials, reiterating promises made over the weekend. President Trump and other administration officials are also scheduled to meet with drug company execs on Monday.

The cases confirmed over the weekend were found in seven states: Washington, California, Illinois, Rhode Island, New York, Florida and Oregon, and included a mix of people who had traveled to high-risk countries, and others believed to have contracted the virus in the US.
Republican-controlled Florida defied Pence‚Äôs urges to ‚Äòremain calm‚Äô and declared a state of emergency on Sunday after the governor‚Äôs office confirmed 2 ‚Äúpresumptively positive‚Äù cases late Sunday, according to a Florida TV station.¬†
The cases were discovered in Florida‚Äôs Manatee County and Hillsborough County.

"Washington State governor declares state of emergency over coronavirus, activates National...","(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî Washington State Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency on Saturday in all counties and authorized activation of U.S. military following the first publically announced death from COVID-19.
‚Äú‚Ä¶The worldwide outbreak of COVID-19 and the effects of its extreme risk of person-to-person transmission throughout the United States and Washington State significantly impact the life and health of our people, as well as the economy of Washington State, and is a public disaster that affects life, health, property or the public peace,‚Äù the proclamation states.
I, Jay Inslee, Governor of the state of Washington, as a result of the above- noted situation, and under Chapters 38.08, 38.52 and 43.06 RCW, do hereby proclaim that a State of Emergency exists in all counties in the state of Washington, and direct the plans and procedures of the Washington State Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan be implemented. State agencies and departments are directed to utilize state resources and to do everything reasonably possible to assist affected political subdivisions in an effort to respond to and recover from the outbreak.
Additionally, the proclamation authorizes the activation of the State Guard.
As a result of this event, I also hereby order into active state service the organized militia of Washington State to include the National Guard and the State Guard, or such part thereof as may be necessary in the opinion of The Adjutant General to address the circumstances described above, to perform such duties as directed by competent authority of the Washington State Military Department in addressing the outbreak. Additionally, I direct the Washington State Department of Health, the Washington State Military Department Emergency Management Division, and other agencies to identify and provide appropriate personnel for conducting necessary and ongoing incident related assessments.
The movement of residents will be limited
From the State Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan:
There are three levels of activation for movement coordination in this appendix:
ÔÇ∑ ¬†Level I ‚Äì Low level activation due to affected infrastructure limiting use of roadways to emergency supply shipments designated by Commercial Vehicle Passes (CVPs). This does not require use of a standalone MCC but is dependent upon effective coordination between the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), Washington State Patrol (WSP), Washington National Guard, US Customs and Border Protection (when logistics transportation crosses the U.S.-Canada border), and the SEOC. Use of MCPs as defined in this plan is not necessary for this level of activation.
ÔÇ∑ ¬†Level II ‚Äì Moderate activation making available limited security escort of sensitive supply shipments. This does not require use of a standalone MCC but is dependent upon effective coordination between the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), Washington State Patrol (WSP), Washington National Guard, US Customs and Border Protection (when logistics transportation crosses the U.S.-Canada border), and the SEOC. MCPs may be used as gathering points for shipments traveling into affected jurisdictions. Normal use of the CVP system applies at this level.
ÔÇ∑ ¬†Level III ‚Äì Full activation including a standalone MCC, multiple MCPs located strategically along major routes leading into the disaster affected area, possible law enforcement established traffic control points/roadblocks, and escorted convoys of emergency supplies. Level III activation is warranted when there is, in the judgment of the Disaster Manager, a distinct and credible threat to the safety of resources transiting through and to disaster areas due to civil unrest, substantial damage to infrastructure, or other restrictions or hazards to movement. Effective operation of a MCC and MCPs is dependent upon effective coordination between the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), Washington State Patrol (WSP), Washington National Guard, US Customs and Border Protection (when logistics transportation crosses the U.S.- Canada border), and the SEOC. The basic process for Level III movement coordination is reflected in the following flow chart:
A statement posted to the governor‚Äôs official website reads as follows:
Gov. Jay Inslee today declared a state of emergency in response to new cases of COVID-19, directing state agencies to use all resources necessary to prepare for and respond to the outbreak.
‚ÄúThis will allow us to get the resources we need,‚Äù Inslee said. ‚ÄúThis is a time to take common-sense, proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of those who live in Washington state. Our state agency directors have been actively preparing since the nation‚Äôs first case appeared in Snohomish County. Washingtonians can be assured we‚Äôve taken this threat seriously and have been working in collaboration with our health care partners to develop plans and procedures to prepare for what could likely be a world-wide pandemic.‚Äù
He issued a proclamation that directs state agencies and departments to utilize state resources and do everything reasonably possible to assist affected communities responding to and recovering from COVID-19 cases. It also allows the use of the Washington National Guard, if necessary. In January, the Washington Military Department activated the State Emergency Operations Center at a Level 1, the highest level, to help coordinate a statewide response.
Today, Public Health ‚Äì Seattle & King County¬†announced the death of an individual with COVID-19, the first in the United States.
The nation‚Äôs first case of COVID-19 was found in a Snohomish County man in January. He had traveled to Wuhan, China and has now recovered. On Feb. 28, the state Department of Health announced two additional cases ‚Äì a King County woman who had recently traveled to South Korea, and a Snohomish County teenager with no travel history. Both are recovering at home and remain in home isolation.
The Department of Health also announced last week that the Public Health Lab in Shoreline now has the capability to test for cases of COVID-19, expediting results.
‚ÄúThis means our state can respond quickly and effectively,‚Äù Inslee said. ‚ÄúOur priority now is to slow the spread of this virus. Our health care professionals say the easiest way to do that is to practice good hygiene ‚Äì wash your hands often, sanitize frequently touched surfaces and stay home when you‚Äôre sick. Preventing future cases will require the work of all of us.‚Äù
For the latest information on the COVID-19 situation, visit the Department of Health‚Äôs website. The Governor‚Äôs Office has also developed a partial list of resources to support economic retention and recovery related to COVID-19 coronavirus.
The proclamation suggests the U.S. military is planning to rollout hot martial law statewide.
Intellihub Editor-In-Chief Shepard Ambellas was the first to announce that martial law would be declared in an American city due to coronavirus in his Feb 1 video warning.

What we know
One thing we do know for sure is that Chinese citizens are being welded into their apartment buildings and left to die. It has happened on many occasions and is not fake news.
Moreover, entire highrises sealed up by Chinese authorities have been lit on fire and burned to the ground with residents inside.

We know that the Chinese government and the government, the government of Iran and the U.S. government have all directly lied to their citizens and have drastically under-reported the situation and number of deaths.
We know that the kill rate of the pathogen is admittedly 18.2% using official numbers from Iran which we know have been held extremely low.
Mainstream even admits the kill rate in Iran is ‚Äú15%.‚Äù

Don‚Äôt think that the same will not happen in America because it will. Martial law plans are already underway. In fact, President Trump even admitted during a White House press conference on Thursday that quarantining entire U.S. cities is not off the table.
Just think, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 3,583 points after plummeting for three straight days and is expected to dive again upon opening on Monday, depending on which news you subscribe to.
To top it all off over 1,100 Chinese nationals have been apprehended entering the U.S. over the past few months. Some of which are expected to have fled Wuhan before the initial flight restrictions were put into place following the Coronavirus outbreak.
Additionally, we know the pathogen is more dangerous than the flu or common cold because entire countries are being sprayed down with disinfectant at the cost of hundreds of millions of dollars a day.

"Report: The novel Coronavirus, 2019‚ÄênCoV, is highly contagious and more infectious...","(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî A report titled The Novel Coronavirus, 2019‚ÄênCoV, is Highly Contagious and More Infectious Than Initially Estimated authored by Steven Sanche, Yen-Ting Lin, Chonggang Xu, Ethan Romero‚ÄêSeverson, Nicolas W. Hengartner, and Ruian Ke concludes that the RŒø value of the 2019-nCov Coronavirus strain is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. ‚Äî meaning the virus is much more deadly than scientists initially thought.
The abstract from the report reads:
The novel coronavirus (2019‚ÄênCoV) is a recently emerged human pathogen that has spread widely since January 2020. Initially, the basic reproductive number, R0, was estimated to be 2.2 to 2.7. Here we provide a new estimate of this quantity. We collected extensive individual case reports and estimated key epidemiology parameters, including the incubation period. Integrating these estimates and high‚Äêresolution real‚Äêtime human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6. We further show that quarantine and contact tracing of symptomatic individuals alone may not be effective and early, strong control measures are needed to stop transmission of the virus.

Claim: I am a senior Chinese military intelligence officer and I...,"(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî Let me preface this post by saying that there is absolutely no way to vet the following information which is why I posted it in the ‚ÄúAnalysis‚Äù category on this website. However, I am posting it in an attempt to flush out what is really going on with the whole COVID-19 Coronavirus outbreak and maybe gain some answers along the way.
I encourage everyone to comment below this post in the comment section and share this far and wide on social media. Knowledge is power.
Take it for what it‚Äôs worth. The following was posted last Tuesday, February 11 on Reddit by user Wuhanvirusthrowaway:
I am a Chinese citizen in Wuhan who occupies ‚Äî or perhaps occupied ‚Äî a high-ranking position in military intelligence. I am also a member of the Chinese Communist Party. As a senior official near the top of the Party, I have access to a great deal of classified information and I have been involved in many top secret government projects. I have a doctorate from a leading university in a western country, which is why I am able to write my account in English.
I have information that I believe could lead to the overthrow of my government. It is also relevant to billions of people outside of China, all of whom are now in existential peril.
It will not surprise you to hear that if my identity were to be revealed, my life would be in grave danger, as would those of my wife and son. I ask you to respect the fact that I have stripped out of this account all facts that would make it easy to identify me.
By now you will be familiar with the recent outbreak of 2019-nCoV, also known as NCP, or simply ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù. You will have heard that it originated in Wuhan, an industrial city in China, and that it came from an animal ‚Äî most likely a bat or a pangolin ‚Äî that was sold in a wild animal market. You will have been told that it is an influenza-like illness that can in severe cases cause pneumonia, respiratory failure and death. Finally, you may have heard that although the disease is highly infectious, it is dangerous only to the elderly or to those who have a compromised immune system. The official lethality rate is approximately 2% or so.
All of that is a bunch of lies concocted by the Chinese state with the tacit support of the U.S. deep state and its friends in the European Union, Russia and Australia, and spread by the docile media in all of those countries.
Let me start by telling you that the world does not operate the way you think it does. Although countries like the US and China vie for global dominance, that competition is restricted to certain limited areas. In most ways, the two countries are more interested in cooperation so that they can stop other competing countries from gaining more power. They also have a shared interest in keeping real power out of the hands of their ‚Äúordinary‚Äù citizens. To this end, they have many different mechanisms by which they control the overwhelming majority of their media outlets. The Americans in particular have perfected the art of creating made-up ‚Äúdivisions‚Äù between their two main parties which are designed to hide the fact that both serve the same masters.
These same nations also posses technology that is far more advanced than you can imagine and which is kept carefully hidden from public view. This includes advanced artificial intelligence capable of undermining and deciding any election in the world; biological and chemical agents that can manipulate and control the thinking patterns and behaviours of citizens to terrifying degrees; highly sophisticated manipulation techniques using hypnotic practices entirely unknown to the public; and other things that I will not go into now. My point is that the great nations do not compete so much as work together. Their principal goal is to shield the true workings of the world from the ‚Äúuninitiated‚Äù public.
Just to give you one example, there aren‚Äôt actually any nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. The U.S. and the Soviet Union scrapped them all in the 1970s, as did their client states. Everyone realised that those weapons could not be used without destroying the whole world, so there was no need for them; but by pretending that they still had them, the big players were able to keep the non-nuclear powers in line.
Let me return to the virus.
Last year, large-scale anti-government protests erupted in Hong Kong. The Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party considered these to be a grave threat to the integrity and stability of the motherland. The U.S. government and the EU both knew that the Chinese were secretly working on a biological agent that was supposed to make the protesters docile and obedient. Without going into detail, I worked on that project. We tried to develop a sort of spray that could be dispersed from helicopters or drones and that would lead to mental retardation and behavioural change.
Naturally, as Hong Kong is one of the most open and international cities in the world, the Party decided that it was too risky to release the agent in Hong Kong without first testing it. For this, it needed a great number of human guinea pigs. Two groups were identified for this.
First, we rounded up a large number of so-called ‚Äúislamic radicals‚Äù in Xinjiang Province and took them to what we called ‚Äútraining camps‚Äú. We had already been using these camps for human experimentation for several years, but the Hong Kong protests meant that we redoubled our efforts. We exposed the inmates to various ‚Äúalpha‚Äù experimental agents. As these were odourless and invisible, the subjects were not aware that they were taking part in medical trials. The resulting high rates of cancer, premature dementia, suicidal depression and death by organ failure could easily be suppressed, as the camps are located in very remote parts of our motherland.
Once the initial experiments had yielded a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù agent, it was transported to Hubei Province, where it was deployed in a special military testing facility outside the city of Wuhan. This was not even a particularly well-kept secret: the existence of this facility has been reported in international news. Even the fact that it is located close to the wild animal market is a known fact.
By then our President had already introduced a ‚Äúsocial credit‚Äù system that allowed us to identify disloyal, counter-revolutionary and bourgeois elements in our society. Using the social credit scores ‚Äî which are taken from online activity, electronic shopping behaviour and reports from informers in civil society ‚Äî we selected some of the worst offenders. These included human rights lawyers and activists, Christians, homosexuals, artists, intellectuals, people who speak foreign languages, and other undesirables.
Once these troublemakers had been collected and placed in the testing facility, we exposed them to the Agent, which is biochemical in nature and spread in an invisible aerosol, akin to certain viruses. Initial results were encouraging, as we saw significant cognitive decline and reduction in higher mental processing facilities. Essentially, our undesirables were becoming mildly mentally disabled, which is precisely the effect we wanted to produce in order to pacify the restive population of Hong Kong.
Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent that the Agent also had other effects. About one week after the retardation set in, our subjects developed major anxiety and panic attacks. Eventually they developed symptoms akin to those of paranoid schizophrenics. At that point, their bodies rapidly deteriorated. They developed massive internal bleeding; the walls of their arteries dissolved; they bled out of their eyes and orifices, and their tissue disintegrated.
To put it in a more direct Western manner, they started to melt.
Death usually occurred through multiple organ failure. This was preceded by at least five days of severe agony which could not be alleviated by painkillers. It was at this time that I first violated our protocol: one subject, an elderly lady who had published defamatory cartoons of our President, begged me for death with such insistence that I took pity and shot her. I was reprimanded, but fortunately the complaint was dropped when I agreed to reimburse the cost of the bullet. I swore to myself never again to show such unnecessary emotion.
We decided that our Agent was unusable. It was far too destructive for our purposes. We wanted the population of Hong Kong to submit to us; we did not want to exterminate it.
Naturally, our American friends had by then taken an interest in our work and asked us for a sample for their own research and testing purposes. They hinted that they wished to use it to resolve certain difficulties in Venezuela. Normally we would have agreed, as we maintain friendly relations with the CIA, but given the extremely toxic nature of the Agent, we declined.
This, as it turned out, was a grave mistake. The CIA was convinced that we had developed something very powerful and wanted to keep it to ourselves. They offered a great deal of money to one of our researchers. Foolishly, he agreed to sell them a specimen. We found out just in time for the handover and tried to stop it from happening. In the ensuing shoot-out ‚Äî don‚Äôt bother to look for it in the news, it was never reported anywhere ‚Äî several dozen people were killed.
More importantly, however, the Agent escaped.
The shoot-out took place at the wild animal market which has been reported as the location of the ‚Äúanimal to human‚Äù transmission that started the outbreak. But of course there was no such transmission; it was just the location where the CIA was supposed to receive the sealed vial containing the Agent. The vial shattered when it was dropped by the traitor who had agreed to sell it to the Americans.
By now I understand you will be sceptical. If I really am who I say I am, why would I be sharing this information on the internet? Let me assure you that I am no friend of the Western system of governance. I love my motherland and I am loyal to the Communist Party. It has lifted hundreds of millions of my compatriots out of squalor and poverty. However, I am also a human being and I have a conscience.
Most importantly, I have a wife and a son.
Once we realised that the Agent had escaped and would start to spread, we swiftly put all of Wuhan into lockdown. I was one of those tasked to manage the fallout of the contamination. Of course we could not keep such a huge undertaking secret, so we decided to order our state media to report that a ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù had broken out in Wuhan.
In reality, of course, there is no ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù. It was all made up.
It was one of my colleagues who came up with the genius idea of pretending that people with the common flu suffered from the coronavirus. This allowed us to hide the true nature of the disease. Let me explain.
It is currently flu season in China. When we realised that we could no longer control the spread of the Agent, we sent our men to all the hospitals and instructed all doctors to diagnose every case of the common flu as ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù. We came up with a new name ‚Äî 2019-nCoV ‚Äî and handed out ‚Äúfactsheets‚Äù that described a made-up illness.
The result of this decision was that tens of thousands of individuals who were simply suffering from a cold or flu were now diagnosed as having a mysterious coronavirus that, although infectious, was not often lethal. While this frightened the public, it allowed us to push the narrative that the disease was not that deadly; it also gave us time to prepare for the catastrophe that was sure to come by imposing a lockdown on Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province.
You have not heard this in the news ‚Äî and given the size of Wuhan, with its population of 11 million, it is not known even to many of the residents ‚Äî but within days thousands upon thousands were infected and before long they suffered the agonising deaths that I have already described. Within a week, there were so many corpses that we did not know what to do with them, so we ordered the surviving social credit prisoners to drive the bodies into the countryside and bury them in mass graves. But it was very difficult to keep this activity secret, and we could not even keep up as there were so many corpses. We planted a story that five million residents had ‚Äúfled‚Äù Wuhan. In reality, of course, many of those people had died from the Agent.
I was working around the clock helping to orchestrate this cover-up. When I think back to my actions now, I feel great shame. At the time I still believed that I was fighting for my motherland and that the rule of the Party was right and just. But deep down, I had already begun to have doubts.
My faith in the Party was shaken even more deeply when I learnt what had happened to Dr Li Wenliang. He was one of the few doctors who refused falsely to diagnose flu patients with the ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù. As a punishment, he was sent to help transport dead bodies to mass graves. The expectation was that he would be infected with the Agent and die an agonising death, but to our great surprise, he did not contract the illness.
You have of course read that he died of ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù. You have been misinformed. A sergeant of the People‚Äôs Armed Police injected him with a mixture of heroin and mercury that caused his lungs to deflate.
When I found out about this I became unsure whether or not I was doing the right thing. While I believe that it is appropriate for a government to rule with a severe hand, I do not think that it was right to kill Dr Li. He was a compassionate and kind man and he cared about his patients; how can our motherland not benefit from having such a doctor?
I shared my concerns with my wife, but she convinced me that I should not say anything to my superiors. She said that it was too dangerous; that they valued loyalty above everything else; and that I would only find trouble if I admitted to my doubts about their practices. She also pointed out that we benefited from priority medical treatment. As senior officials, we received regular supplies of the highly-sophisticated hazmat masks that are the only known technology that can prevent infection. She implored me to think of our son, who is still small. If I spoke out and were caught, our lives would be at risk.
Around the same time, it became clear that the Agent was entirely beyond our control. It was spreading like wildfire throughout Hubei Province and beyond, infecting tens of millions and causing them all to die.
I understand that what I just said is difficult to believe, because you have been told that there have been only about 50,000 infections, and far fewer deaths. But these are the influenza infections that have been falsely passed off as the non-existent ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù. The Agent is far, far more contagious than that, and its fatality rate, unlike the ‚Äúcoronavirus‚Äù, is not 2%.
No, its fatality rate is 100%. Nobody recovers from it. Everybody who contracts it dies.
And a lot of people are contracting it.
Hubei Province lies in ruins. The various travel restrictions and lockdowns that have been imposed were not created to stop the spread of the Agent ‚Äî none of them can stop it, not embargoes, not face masks or hand sanitiser ‚Äî but to stop the survivors from seeing the catastrophe with their own eyes.
I am part of the greatest cover-up in human history: the hiding of the deaths of tens of millions. Very soon, Hubei Province will be no more than a giant mortuary, and the truth will come out.
For me, the turning point came when the Party told yet another lie, and that lie was too dreadful even for me to accept. You may have heard that China built a new hospital, called Huoshenshan Hospital, in Wuhan, in order to provide additional quarantine and isolation facilities for infected patients. You may have heard that they built it in only ten days.
That too is a lie.
Sure, they did build something in six days. But it was not a hospital. The true nature of the building was top secret. Initially, I was naive enough to believe that the Party was demonstrating its compassion and care for the people. But then my superiors sent me to Huoshenshan. I was shown around the installation by a military police officer called Corporal Meng (this is not his real name). It was there that I saw the truth.
As I have mentioned, the only way to protect oneself from the Agent is by wearing a special protective mask that is entirely unlike those available commercially. Even medical professionals do not have access to it. It is available only to biomedical warfare researchers and it contains extremely advanced technology.
These masks need to be kept at a particular temperature to offer full protection, and lose their effectiveness very quickly. As I have also already said, one of the benefits of my position was that both my family and I had access to regular supplies, which is why were safe when compared to civilians, doctors and even lower-level government officials, all of whom wore utterly ineffective surgical masks in the misguided belief that they would protect them.
And so, wearing this special equipment, I went to Huoshenshan with Corporal Meng.
Whatever you want to call that place, it is not a hospital. Sure, the entrance looks like a hospital and in the ward at the front of the complex, there are what appear to be normal medical beds. There, thousands of infected patients lie, all of them in the early stages of the disease. I walked along those long, white corridors next to Corporal Meng, his angular face dispassionate in his military fatigues, and saw hundreds upon hundreds of identical hospital beds on which squirmed the terrified and diseased inhabitants of Wuhan. Their cries and pleas haunt me in the long nights in which I now am unable to sleep.
But this was merely the beginning. Eventually the Corporal took me to the rear of this front section. There, locked metal gates led to what he called the ‚Äúmiddle section‚Äù. The patients in the front are unaware of its existence. It is there that the more advanced cases are kept, in what most closely resembles a mental asylum.
Immediately upon entering this part of Huoshenshan I was struck by the dim lighting and stench of vomit and human waste. Here the unfortunates roamed freely, their minds gradually disintegrating in endless panic attacks and psychotic episodes. Here too there were no more doctors, merely gorilla-faced men in black uniforms who belonged to some secret branch of the military police I had never heard of.
They appeared to have been selected for their cruelty, for they beat and degraded the patients in the most sadistic manner. Many of the inmates had regressed to childlike states and lay on the floor weeping like infants and begging for compassion that they did not receive. There was cruel pleasure in the eyes of these thugs as they brutalised the unfortunates. They beat them with batons, sprayed pepper spray into their eyes and kicked them with their steel-capped boots. As I was from military intelligence, the guards did not even attempt to hide their activities. They even invited me to join; in every way, they treated me as one of them.
Yes, one of them. I stood in the grey staff bathroom of Huoshenshan and looked into a cheap mirror and asked myself ‚Äî is this really what you are? Are you really like them?
But the violence was not merely an expression of sadism, for the poor inmates were not there to be cared for.
They were there to work.
There was one more set of doors, and beyond them lay what the Corporal called the ‚ÄúCore‚Äù. And it was there that I saw it ‚Äî piles and piles of dead bodies, stacked on top of one another all the way to the ceiling. There were men, women and children, elderlies and toddlers, rich and poor, beautiful and misshapen, proud and humble.
They were all of them dead. Our Agent made no distinction between any of them.
I gasped when the Corporal led me to the Core. I cannot count how many there were, but it was many, many thousands. And in the midst of the piles of corpses was a kind of path, and I heard a roaring sound in the distance. The miserable patients from the middle section picked up the dead and carried and dragged them away into the dark, even as the guards beat them with truncheons.
It took me a little while before I grasped what was happening. I simply could not believe what lay at the end of that path in the Core.
It was an enormous furnace, with great fires roaring within.
One by one, their minds destroyed and their bodies twisted, the dying men and women carried the corpses to the furnace and cast them inside in a doomed attempt to hide the dreadful truth. I saw several of them collapse from exhaustion only for their lifeless bodies to be added to the mountains of corpses on both sides. In a seemingly endless line they went, their emaciated bodies clad in grey overalls, their backs bent under the weight of their dreadful cargo. Many howled and groaned in terror and their voices joined in a sorrowful cacophony that lingered over the roar of the fires.
In deep shock, I stared at the boundless horror before me. Beside me stood Corporal Meng, his freshly-shaved face as emotionless as before. When I turned to face him, he looked at me. His mouth smiled, but his eyes did not.
‚ÄúWe use the energy to operate Huoshenshan,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe save the state considerable resources in this way. And look,‚Äù ‚Äî he waved at the gallery of the dead ‚Äî ‚Äúthere are so many of them here. You could almost describe it as renewable energy.‚Äù He laughed and waved his hand in a strangely camp gesture.
I stood speechless and stared at the infernal scenes before me. Men in black uniforms screamed like daemons at the wretches who were disposing of the corpses for them. They stripped the dead of anything that had value ‚Äî jewellery, cash, expensive clothing ‚Äî and tossed these items onto an enormous pile next to the furnace. When I asked the Corporal what would be done with the items, they said that they would be used to pay for the ‚Äúhealthcare expenses‚Äù incurred by the patients‚Äô stay in Huoshenshan.
I vomited in the toilet. When I flushed and came out of the stall, Corporal Meng stood by the door and looked at me. His face was as blank as before, but in his eyes I thought I registered a very faint trace of contempt. You are ten years my senior, the look said, but you are soft.
I thanked him for his service and went home.
When I arrived, I saw that I had received hundreds of updates on the encrypted device the Party uses to communicate to insiders. The news were unimaginably grim. The State Legal and Economic Commission had allocated funds for the construction of dozens of facilities like Huoshenshan all throughout China. The Agent had spread not only to every single province of the motherland, but to most other nations in the world. Fortunately, we had agreements in place with other governments ‚Äî they agreed to pretend that the infections were due to a coronavirus. They were just as worried as we were that a panic might break out in their countries. The Americans in particular were terrified that the S&P 500 might decline. This, they said, would be unacceptable in an election year, so we could count on their full support.
Of course the World Health Organisation also helped us. For a long time, the only issue with the WHO has been that we have been locked in a contest with the Americans about who bribes them more. They released all sorts of sophisticated misinformation about having decoded the DNA of the so-called coronavirus. All this has allowed us to stave off a global panic.
For now.
Yet the situation was worsening with astonishing speed. I am reluctant to reveal too much on this point, as it would make it too easy for my enemies to identify me, but we quickly began to implement measures to protect our most senior leaders. If you look at the world news, you will see that Xi Jinping, our President, disappeared for approximately one week after the outbreak, before being seen again with the leader of Cambodia.
You should know that the person who met the Cambodian leader was not President Xi. It was a body double who had, for many years, been trained to look and sound just like our President. President Xi is of course not careless enough to risk his own death. He is safely ensconced in a secret bunker underneath Zhongnanhai, the headquarters of the Party in Beijing.
Nor was he the only leader who is in hiding. In fact, I can assure you that over half of all senior Party members are currently being imitated by trained actors who are following instructions given to them via special implants. Do you really think that our Prime Minister would risk his life by going to Wuhan?
All of this means that our government has become utterly paralysed and the functions of the state have been taken over by the military.
It became clear to me that our efforts were pointless. Yes, the lockdowns, travel bans and targeted assassinations of rebellious journalists allowed us to hide the true situation in Wuhan; but I knew that this would not last. Once the mass deaths begin in the rest of the world ‚Äî in our estimation, this should happen within the next week or so ‚Äî everyone will know the truth. It will become clear that we cannot protect ourselves from the Agent. Surgical masks, hand sanitiser, gloves ‚Äî nothing can stop it. Nothing except the special hazmat masks, but those cannot be produced in anything like sufficient quantities. You, an ordinary person, will never even receive one, let alone a sufficient number to see you through the coming holocaust.
For those of you reading this, therefore, all I can suggest is that you keep your loved ones close to you. Hug them, tell them what they mean to you. Enjoy the time you have left with them. It is not typical in Chinese culture to express one‚Äôs feelings in this way, but I have learnt the importance of such gestures.
I promised my wife that I would show this document to her before I posted it.
Yet I broke my word.
I hear her weep in loud, hoarse sobs in the bedroom, and the keyboard of my laptop is wet with my own tears. Not long ago, we received results of the regular tests that are part of our ‚Äúpriority medical treatment‚Äù, and we learnt that my son had been infected with the Agent.
The military police that has supplied me with the special protective mask had been giving expired and ineffective masks to my son, masks that senior officials had already worn and then discarded when they ceased to protect them. My own masks, on the other hand, had always been of the necessary quality.
I suppose they decided that my son was of lower priority than me. I suppose my son could not help them with their cover-up.
We had long ago decided that we would be different ‚Äî we would be honest with him, always. And so when he asked us, we told him the truth. We told him that he was very sick. He asked more, and we told him he would not get better.
He continued asking, and we told him that he would die. He is very small, but he was old enough to understand.
His terrified wails will haunt me for the rest of my miserable days in this world.
Let them come. Let them do with me as they will. I no longer care.
One day after the above post, on Wednesday, February 12 a second message was posted by Wuhanvirusthrowaway. Take note of how the post is worded. Almost as if it was written by the communist party. Was the author hunted down and forced to post the following statement?
After calming down and reflecting, I realized that I was not, and my words disturbed the social order. The above-mentioned artificial virus does not exist, and I have changed the former, and promised not to make such untrue and false statements on the Internet. The construction of The Fire God Mountain Hospital is a remarkable initiative, which shows the ordinary and the great of the working people „ÄÇ I believe that in the future, the country is willing to make the greatest efforts to serve the party sincerely and work together with the people to work through the difficulties.
I sincerely repent. There is no falsehood in the above. I have not been forced by anyone. These are all words that I voluntarily want to say.

Video montage shows what is really happening in China amid Coronavirus...,"(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî The situation is deteriorating fast in China as the Coronavirus continues to sweep the land.
Hundreds of videos from the region show extremely violent and gruesome images of men, women, and children being overtaken by their very own government.
To make matters worse local hooligans are suspected of having been contracted by PLA security forces to threaten and detain ordinary citizens.
Thousands upon thousands of people have been taken to camps in which the ultimate fate they suffer is unknown as none have ever returned.
To top it all off, video footage from the region was posted to Live Leak which appeared to show streets in Wuhan flowing with blood. Needless to say, the video was soon taken down after the user‚Äôs account was terminated.
‚ÄúThread deleted after account termination,‚Äù a message on the original post reads.
Here is a screenshot of the original video preview thumbnail:

Hong Kong Coronavirus expert warns outbreak could infect ‚Äúbetween 60%-80%‚Äù of...,"The city of Hong Kong and its 7 million+ residents have reason to be extremely anxious about the nCoV outbreak that has already caused more than 1,000 deaths on the mainland. Back in 2003, SARS ripped through the densely populated largely autonomous city and killed some 300 people, nearly half the total death toll from the outbreak.
Professor Gabriel Leung, the chair of public health medicine at Hong Kong University, was one of the first officials anywhere in China to suggest that the government was hiding, or simply hadn‚Äôt yet confirmed, the true extend of the outbreak.
Though Beijing has been touting a ‚Äòslowdown‚Äô in the number of newly diagnosed cases, few believe that the outbreak has actually crested, even as a huge percentage of the population in the world‚Äôs largest country has spent the last week huddled inside.
Which is why we feel Leung‚Äôs latest warning is worth our attention, and yours.
Riffing off of comments from WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who said yesterday that the we might be seeing only ‚Äòthe tip of the iceberg‚Äô in terms of number of cases, Leung said the scientific community‚Äôs ‚Äòoverriding concern‚Äô is figuring out the ‚Äòsize and shape‚Äô of the iceberg.
Leung added that most experts now believe the virus has a transmission rate of ‚Äì or r-sub-zero ‚Äì of 2.5, meaning the average infected individual will transmit the virus to 2.5 others. This also translates to an ‚Äúattack rate‚Äù of 60%-80%, the Guardian reports.
‚ÄúSixty per cent of the world‚Äôs population is an awfully big number,‚Äù Leung told the Guardian in London, en route to an expert meeting at the WHO in Geneva on Tuesday.
On Tuesday morning, Chinese health officials confirmed nearly 100 new deaths, bringing the toll to 1,013 as of late Monday.

If the virus continues to spread at this pace, even a relatively low fatality rate of 1% ‚Äì which Leung believes is possible once milder, undetected cases are accounted for ‚Äì could still lead to a massive death toll. Rough calculations indicate that, if two-thirds of the 7.7 billion people living on earth are infected, a 1% mortality rate would still lead to nearly 51 million deaths. 
Once all of these other variables have been determined, Leung said he would tell the WHO that the main issues would be figuring out the scale of the worsening global epidemic, and learning whether China‚Äôs draconian measures have worked to help suppress the spread.

The upcoming meeting in Geneva, which Leung plans to attend, will bring together more than 400 researchers and national authorities. Some plan to participate by video conference from the mainland and Taiwan.
‚ÄúWith 99% of cases in China, this remains very much an emergency for that country, but one that holds a very grave threat for the rest of the world,‚Äù Dr. Tedros said last week.
One of the world‚Äôs leading experts on coronavirus epidemics, Leung played a major role in fighting the SARS outbreak and has worked closely with other leading scientists, including counterparts in the UK.
Does Leung really think the virus will infect 80% of the world‚Äôs population? Or even 60%? Maybe not. The virus has reportedly been mutating and changing as it has spread, and it‚Äôs still possible it could change in ways that inadvertently help humanity suppress it. For example, it could ‚Äúattenuate its lethality,‚Äù as Leung put it.
Epidemiologists and modellers were trying to figure out what was likely to happen, said Leung. ‚ÄúIs 60-80% of the world‚Äôs population going to get infected? Maybe not. Maybe this will come in waves. Maybe the virus is going to attenuate its lethality because it certainly doesn‚Äôt help it if it kills everybody in its path, because it will get killed as well,‚Äù he said.
But if we don‚Äôt figure out exactly how bad the outbreak has already gotten, it will be much more difficult to stop it from arriving at the worst-case scenarios.",2020-02-11T08:48:10+00:00,https://www.intellihub.com/hong-kong-coronavirus-expert-warns-outbreak-could-infect-between-60-80-of-humanity-killing-51-million/
"‚ÄòDiamond Princess‚Äô reports 66 new Coronavirus infections, bringing the total to...","The Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that has been quarantined off the coast of Yokohama, Japan for roughly a week now, saw the total number of confirmed nCoV infections climb to 136 on Monday, cementing its position as the host of the largest outbreak outside China.
Japanese health authorities have been extremely careful in dealing with the ship, which has become a massive albatross for the government of PM Shinzo Abe. While Hong Kong let a cruise ship sail yesterday following a 4-day quarantine (the ship was reportedly found to be free of viral infections), the ‚ÄòDiamond Princess‚Äô, and the 2,500+ remaining passengers and crew, will be stuck in place until mid-February. The NYT chronicled the growing sense of unease and paranoia aboard the ship, which we cited yesterday.
The ship‚Äôs captain Stefano Ravera announced Monday that 66 new cases of the virus had been confirmed, bringing the infection total of passengers and crew to 136, roughly equal to all the other cases in Asia outside China. Media reports have claimed more than 2,500 passengers and crew remain aboard the ship.
According to CNBC, the nationalities of the newly infected are Japanese (45), American (11), Australian (four), Filipino (three), Canadian (one), English (one) and Ukrainian (one). Notably, all of these infections occurred from person to person, since they were all spread from ‚Äòpatient zero‚Äô to others aboard the ship.
Princess Cruises, the Carnival Japan unit that owns the ship, told NBC News that it was continuing to follow guidance from Japan‚Äôs health ministry regarding plans for providing medical care and passengers ultimately disembarking. Meanwhile, one passenger told the NYT yesterday that those aboard the ship are being left in the dark, and have resorted to tracking the comings and goings of ambulances to try to keep abreast of what‚Äôs going on. Many suspect the virus has been spread through the ship‚Äôs ventilation system.
The ship was quarantined for two weeks after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong on Jan. 25 tested positive for the virus six days after leaving. After initially finding no cases aboard the ship, the cruise line copped to the first ten cases, prompting more intense scrutiny by the Japanese government. Princess Cruises said it didn‚Äôt expect new cases to be confirmed after the beginning of the quarantine, though that has clearly happened.
So far, it doesn‚Äôt look like the virus has made the jump from the ship to the surrounding area. If that happens, expect Japanese authorities to resort to the same types of draconian quarantine measures that have been imposed in China.",2020-02-10T07:40:23+00:00,https://www.intellihub.com/diamond-princess-reports-66-new-coronavirus-infections-bringing-the-total-to-136/

The Chinese government has declared a ‚Äòwartime‚Äô situation prompting fears of mass extermination or firebombing of the populace on the Innerweb.
The mainstream media is even reporting snatch and grabs as seen in this NBC report.

China Daily reports that Shanghai official have revealed Coronavirus transmission modes.
From China Daily:
Confirmed transmission routes of the novel coronavirus include direct transmission, contact transmission and aerosol transmission, a Shanghai official said on Saturday.
‚ÄúAerosol transmission refers to the mixing of the virus with droplets in the air to form aerosols, which causes infection after inhalation, according to medical experts,‚Äù said Zeng Qun, deputy head of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau.
‚ÄúAs such, we have called on the public to raise their awareness of the prevention and control of the disease caused by family gatherings,‚Äù said Zeng during at a daily media briefing by the municipal government regarding efforts to contain the spread of the virus.
Experts explained that direct transmission refers to infection caused by inhalation of air close to a patient who sneezes and coughs, while contact transmission occurs when a person touches an object tainted with droplets containing the virus before infecting himself through subsequent contact with the membranes of his mouth, nose and eyes.

HIV insertions found in 2019-nCoV Coronavirus signify possible release of weaponized...,"(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî It is no longer a conspiracy to think that a Chinese seafood market was not the origin of the recent Coronavirus outbreak as more and more information across the interweb points to the possibility that 2019-nCoV is indeed a weaponized strain.
Whether the deadly contagion was released by mistake or on purpose it may have originated from China‚Äôs Level 4 National Biosafety Laboratory located at the Wuhan Institute of Virology as reports claim.
New information confirmed by a top epidemiologist reveals how the 2019-nCoV does, in fact, contain ‚ÄúHIV insertions‚Äù which appear to have been done by man.
From ZeroHedge.com:
The theory is that the virus, which was developed by infectious disease experts may have originated in the Wuhan-based lab of Dr. Peng Zhou, China‚Äôs preeminent researcher of bat immune systems, specifically in how their immune systems adapt to the presence of viruses like coronavirus and other destructive viruses. Somehow, the virus escaped from the lab, and the Hunan fish market where the virus supposedly originated is merely a ruse.
Now, a respected epidemiologist who recently caught flack for claiming in a twitter threat that the virus appeared to be much more contagious than initially believed is pointing out irregularities in the virus‚Äôs genome that suggests it might have been genetically engineered for the purposes of a weapon, and not just any weapon but the deadliest one of all. 
In ‚ÄúUncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag‚Äú, Indian researchers are baffled by segments of the virus‚Äôs RNA that have no relation to other coronaviruses like SARS, and instead appear to be closer to HIV. The virus even responds to treatment by HIV medications.

In the abstract of the epidemiologist‚Äôs report, it was determined that the virus ‚Äúis unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.‚Äù (i.e. the virus was likely engineered)
Key findings from the paper:
Our phylogentic tree of full-length coronaviruses suggests that 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS CoV [Fig1].

In addition, other recent studies have linked the 2019-nCoV to SARS CoV. We therefore compared the spike glycoprotein sequences of the 2019-nCoV to that of the SARS CoV (NCBI Accession number: AY390556.1). On careful examination of the sequence alignment we found that the 2019- nCoV spike glycoprotein contains 4 insertions [Fig.2]. To further investigate if these inserts are present in any other corona virus, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the spike glycoprotein amino acid sequences of all available coronaviruses (n=55) [refer Table S.File1] in NCBI refseq (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) this includes one sequence of 2019-nCoV[Fig.S1]. We found that these 4 insertions [inserts 1, 2, 3 and 4] are unique to 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses analyzed. Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses . Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses (Zhou et al., 2020).
We then translated the aligned genome and found that these inserts are present in all Wuhan 2019-nCoV viruses except the 2019-nCoV virus of Bat as a host [Fig.S4]. Intrigued by the 4 highly conserved inserts unique to 2019-nCoV we wanted to understand their origin. For this purpose, we used the 2019-nCoV local alignment with each insert as query against all virus genomes and considered hits with 100% sequence coverage. Surprisingly, each of the four inserts aligned with short segments of the Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) proteins. The amino acid positions of the inserts in 2019-nCoV and the corresponding residues in HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 Gag are shown in Table 1.

The first 3 inserts (insert 1,2 and 3) aligned to short segments of amino acid residues in HIV-1 gp120. The insert 4 aligned to HIV-1 Gag. The insert 1 (6 amino acid residues) and insert 2 (6 amino acid residues) in the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV are 100% identical to the residues mapped to HIV-1 gp120. The insert 3 (12 amino acid residues) in 2019- nCoV maps to HIV-1 gp120 with gaps [see Table 1]. The insert 4 (8 amino acid residues) maps to HIV-1 Gag with gaps.
Additionally, the United States declared a public health emergency on Friday due and has even implemented the quarantine of select American citizens under provisions put into place by the Obama administration.
Moreover, a journalist by the name of Adrian Bond writing for the publication Medium describes in his most recent piece how ‚Äúoutright suspicious‚Äù it is that the Google listing for the Wuhan Institute of Virology had changed over the course of just a week.
Bond writes:
UPDATE ‚Äî JANUARY 29, 2020: What‚Äôs also odd, and outright suspicious, is that as of January 29, 2020, the location of Wuhan Institute of Virology (where the National Biosafety Laboratory is headquartered) on Google Maps has inexplicably moved since I first viewed it on January 24, 2020 and published this article on January 27, 2020.

‚ÄúFirst it was Facebook, then all of New Zealand; now Twitter has decided to suspend Zero Hedge,‚Äù Zero Hedge‚Äôs Tyler Durden writes in response to Twitter‚Äôs actions.
Just as in the prior bans, which were eventually overturned, so in this case, it is unclear what prompted Twitter‚Äôs abrupt censorship: the only notification we received from Twitter was the following:
It is news to us that this website has (ever) ‚Äúengaged in the targeted harassment of someone.‚Äù
What appears to have happened is that twitter received a complaint from the website best known for publishing the discredited Steele dossier when no other media outlet would touch it, and making cat slideshows of course, Buzzfeed, in which someone called Ryan Broderick writes that Zero Hedge¬† ‚Äúhas released the personal information of a scientist from Wuhan, China, falsely accusing them of creating the coronavirus as a bioweapon, in a plot it said is the real-life version of the video game Resident Evil.‚Äù
I‚Äôve reached out to Twitter for clarity on this but it looks like ZeroHedge may have been suspended following my piece about them doxing a Chinese scientist and accusing him of weaponizing the #coronavirus https://t.co/B3XXRCjJpQ pic.twitter.com/RLCR3Eg6q0
‚Äî Ryan Broderick (@broderick) January 31, 2020

A few points: the article referenced by Buzz Feed, ‚ÄúIs This The Man Behind The Global Coronavirus Pandemic?‚Äù, is as the title implies, a question, and one which considering the huge significance and life or death import of the Coronavirus pandemic, has to be answered, especially since even the establishment‚Äôs Foreign Policy magazine writes bat soup, which is widely being cited and circulated by the mainstream press as the cause of the coronavirus breakout, is not the cause of the Wuhan virus. The widely-read website Health.com also chimes in: ‚ÄúNo, Coronavirus Was Not Caused by ‚ÄòBat Soup‚Äò‚Äù. Meanwhile, Business Insider writes ‚ÄúExperts think the Wuhan coronavirus jumped from bats to snakes to people. Bats have been the source of at least 4 pandemics.‚Äù
So considering that Peng Zhou, who currently works at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is the Leader of the Bat Virus Infection and Immunization Group at the Institute, the question certainly is a reasonable one and, in a normal world, would demand an answer from the established media (assuming it wasn‚Äôt afraid of risking lucrative Chinese funding) instead of leaving it to ‚Äúfringe‚Äù websites.
The impetus to ask the question if the disease originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology is especially relevant in light of social media reports such as this one which claims to ‚Äúhave evidence here that the outbreak originated from Wuhan P4 Research Institute. You need to find a truly patriotic journalist to publish it to the public. You can personally trust me to provide a complete chain of evidence. Thank you.‚Äù

In defense of Zero Hedge Tyler Durden writes:
So did we have a right to ask the question if there is an alternative version for the emergence of the Coronavirus pandemic, especially with hundreds if not thousands of lives at stake? Absolutely.
As for Broderick‚Äôs statement that Peng was ‚Äúaccused falsely‚Äù we wonder how he knows this: did he speak to Peng? Did he get any comments? Did he get an official denial? No, he did not: as he writes, ‚ÄúBuzzFeed News has reached out to the scientist, whom it is declining to name.‚Äù So, it actually turns out that it is Buzzfeed that is once again presenting a false statement as fact, something Buzzfeed has been accused of doing over and over and over.
Meanwhile, those who wonder if Dr. Zhou has any link to the possible emergence of the Coronavirus following years of experimenting with bats, we urge you to read our full article instead of relying on the hearsay of ideologically biased journalists.
Second, and contrary to the claims presented by Buzzfeed, we did not release any ‚Äúpersonal information‚Äù: Peng Zhou (Âë®Èπè) is a public figure, and all the contact information that we presented was pulled from his publicly posted bio found on a website at the Wuhan Institute of Virology which anyone with access to the internet can pull from the following URL: http://sourcedb.whiov.cas.cn/zw/rck/201705/t20170505_4783973.html, which is also the information we used.

Update (2100ET): Nearly two weeks since the start of the Coronavirus epidemic which has now resulted in over 100,000 Chinese being placed under observation and over 210 people dead the US finally did the right thing when late on Thursday the U.S. State Department warned Americans not to travel to China because of the spreading coronavirus outbreak.
‚ÄúDo not travel to China due to novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China. On January 30, the World Health Organization has determined the rapidly spreading outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice.¬† Commercial carriers have reduced or suspended routes to and from China.‚Äù
The new travel advisory was issued hours after the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency. ‚ÄúThose currently in China should consider departing using commercial means,‚Äù the department said in the advisory.

Update (1900ET): The NHC is reporting a total of 9,692 coronavirus cases across China, up from 7,711 yesterday, an increase of 1,982 cases, and with 15,238 new suspected cases, up by over 3,000 from 12,167 yesterday, there are now 25,060 probable cases. Additionally, 213 total deaths have been confirmed, up from 170, the biggest daily increase so far.
A total of 102,427 people are now under medical observation in China.

Outside of China 102 international cases were reported‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶ including 28 cases across Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. This brings the total confirmed worldwide to 9,822.
Putting this in the context of the deadly SARS epidemic, the coronavirus pandemic has now officially exceeded SARS in cumulative cases in just two weeks. 

* * *
Update (1730ET): Hubei Province has just confirmed another 42 coronavirus-related deaths for Thursday, another huge jump on par with some of the announcements from earlier in the week.
At present, 5486 cases are still being treated in the hospital (among them: 804 cases of severe cases and 290 cases of critical cases). Hubei diagnosed another 1,220 cases, bringing the total number for both China and the world above 9,000, well above SARS global total.
Here‚Äôs the full statement, translated to English via Google:
From 00:00 to 2400 on January 30, 2020 , Hubei Province newly added 1220 cases of pneumonia infected by new type of coronavirus (including: 378 in Wuhan, 55 in Huangshi, 31 in Shiyan, 123 in Xiangyang, Yichang 50 cases, 70 cases in Jingzhou City, 36 cases in Jingmen City, 66 cases in Ezhou City, 142 cases in Xiaogan City, 77 cases in Huanggang City, 36 cases in Xianning City, 85 cases in Suizhou City, 9 cases in Enshi Prefecture, 35 cases in Xiantao City, and Tianmen City 23 cases, 2 cases in Qianjiang City, and 2 cases in Shennongjia Forest District). There were 42 new deaths in the province (among them: 30 in Wuhan, 1 in Jingmen, 4 in Ezhou, 3 in Xiaogan, 1 in Xiantao, and 3 in Tianmen). There were 26 new hospital discharges (including: 21 in Wuhan, 2 in Xiaogan, 1 in Huanggang, and 2 in Shennongjia Forest District).
As of 24:00 on January 30, 2020, Hubei Province has reported a total of 5806 cases of pneumonia caused by new coronavirus infections (including 2639 cases in Wuhan, 168 in Huangshi, 150 in Shiyan, 286 in Xiangyang, and 167 in Yichang. 221 cases in Jingzhou, 227 in Jingmen, 189 in Ezhou, 541 in Xiaogan, 573 in Huanggang, 166 in Xianning, 228 in Suizhou, 75 in Enshi, 90 in Xiantao, and 67 in Tianmen , 12 cases in Qianjiang City, 7 cases in Shennongjia Forest District), 116 cases have been discharged and 204 deaths (including: 159 cases in Wuhan, 1 case in Huangshi City, 1 case in Yichang City, 3 cases in Jingzhou City, and 5 cases in Jingmen City). (6 cases in Ezhou City, 9 cases in Xiaogan City, 12 cases in Huanggang City, 1 case in Xiantao City, 6 cases in Tianmen City, and 1 case in Qianjiang City). At present, 5486 cases are still being treated in the hospital (among them: 804 cases of severe cases and 290 cases of critical cases), and they are all treated in isolation at designated medical institutions. A total of 35,144 close contacts have been tracked, and 32,340 people are still under medical observation.
Meanwhile, the Chinese ambassador to the UN is holding a press briefing, as Turkish Airlines becomes the latest to suspend flights to China (including routes to Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Xian).
In other news, India TV is reporting a suspected coronavirus-related death, what would be the first outside China. A 22-year-old man from Tripura died in a Malaysian Hospital Thursday, according to family sources. However, this has not yet been confirmed. Earlier reports about a Thai woman dying of nCoV in India were likewise never confirmed.

Earlier, the White House said it had launched a task force that will meet daily to oversee the response to the coronavirus outreak that has resulted in at least five confirmed cases in the US, NBC reports. However, an expert who appeared on CNBC Thursday morning pointed out that the administration is a little behind the 8-ball.

National health officials in Beijing announced a slew of new cases and virus-related deaths early Thursday morning (nearly 8,000 have been sickened, another 12,000 cases are suspected, and roughly 170 have died), but since then, things have been quiet.
If the recent past is any guide, this would suggest another dump of new cases and deaths is in the offing.
Three new cases were confirmed in Vietnam overnight. But in terms of news flow, most of the drama during the early hours of Thursday centered around Italy and Russia.

A map of cases hasn‚Äôt yet reflected the suspected cases in Italy.

With the WHO set to reconvene its emergency committee in Geneva on Thursday for the third time in a week, experts are calling on the supra-national organization to label the outbreak a ‚Äúpublic health emergency of international concern,‚Äù or PHEIC ‚Äì the official designation of a global pandemic.
The 16 independent experts on the WHO‚Äôs emergency committee will advise Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on the decision and give recommendations for managing the outbreak. Earlier this week, Tedros met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing earlier in the week to discuss the situation. Twice last week, the WHO decided to hold off on declaring a public health emergency, saying it was ‚Äútoo soon,‚Äù according to the SCMP.
Hitoshi Oshitani, a former regional adviser on communicable disease surveillance and response at the WHO‚Äôs Western Pacific office, told the SCMP that there is an ‚Äúimminent risk‚Äù of a dangerous global outbreak.
‚ÄúI think the WHO should have declared a public health emergency of international concern earlier. They are supposed to declare PHEIC based on a risk of international spread. There was already significant risk of international spread one week ago,‚Äù Oshitani said.
Oshitani added that controlling this new coronavirus is proving more difficult than suppressing the 2003 SARS outbreak, largely because the virus can spread via individuals who are infected, but exhibit few ‚Äì or no ‚Äì symptoms.
‚ÄúFor Sars, patients were infectious only when they developed very severe illness. But for this virus, patients are likely to be infectious even during the incubation period. If so, rapid isolation is not enough to contain the virus,‚Äù he said.
SARS infected 8,000 people and killed 813 worldwide. The coronavirus outbreak has already surpassed SARS in terms of the number of cases in China. Globally, the virus has already effectively tied SARS for the number of confirmed cases, though if skeptical epidemiologists are correct, the true number of cases has already far surpassed the total for SARs.
A number of evacuation missions have been completed, as the US and Japan have flown citizens trapped in Wuhan to safety. However, Japanese officials discovered that several citizens on the flight were infected with the virus, leading to a mass quarantine. UK officials said that citizens evacuated from Wuhan must agree to spend two weeks in quarantine after returning to the UK.
About 6,000 passengers and crew aboard the cruise ship ‚ÄúCosta Smeralda,‚Äù owned by the Carnival Corporation, have been confined to the vessel on Thursday amid new fears that two Chinese passengers are suspected of having coronavirus, reported¬†Reuters.
Two Chinese tourists, traveling from Hong Hong and, originally, from Macau, have been placed in ‚Äúisolation in separate rooms of the ship‚Äôs sanitary space,‚Äù said local media outlet,¬†ANSA.

It is a vacation that risks ending like a nightmare, we hope to go down soon,‚Äù a passenger of the ship told ANSA.
The cruise ship has already moored in Marseilles in France and several Spanish ports this week before docking on Thursday at Civitavecchia, north of Rome.
Reuters notes that all passengers have been confined to the ship as tests are underway to determine if the two Chinese tourists have coronavirus.

On Tuesday morning, China‚Äôs top health officials shared some grim statistics essentially confirming that the novel coronavirus believed to have emerged from a shady food market in Wuhan is on track to confirm some of the more dire projections shared by epidemiologists.
As we reported late yesterday, the death toll in China has soared past 100 while the number of confirmed cases doubled overnight. Health officials around the world have confirmed more than 4,500 cases, more than triple the number from Friday. All but a few of the deaths recorded so far have been in Wuhan or the surrounding Hubei province, per the SCMP.
Panic has swept across the region as border closures appear to be the overarching theme of Tuesday‚Äôs sessions. Even North Korea, which relies on China for 90% of its foreign trade, has closed the border with its patron. More than 50 million remain on lockdown in Hubei, and transit restrictions have been imposed by cities and regions around the country. An ‚Äòextension‚Äô of the Lunar New Year holiday is threatening GDP growth, as economists try to size up the knock-on potential impact on the global economy. The virus has now spread across China and another 17 countries/autonomous territories globally, according to BBG.
But the most important announcement made overnight ‚Äì at least as far as global markets are concerned ‚Äì was Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam‚Äôs decision to suspend high-speed rail and ferry service, while halving the number of flights between HK and the mainland. This news helped send US stock futures higher in early trade, after health experts yesterday urged Lam to use ‚Äòdraconian‚Äô measures to curb the spread, for fear of a repeat of the SARS epidemic, which killed some 300 people, according to the BBC.
‚ÄúThe flow of people between the two places needs to be drastically reduced‚Äù amid the outbreak, Ms Lam told the South China Morning Post.
China, meanwhile, said it would stop individuals from traveling to Hong Kong to try and curb the virus.
Travel between mainland #China & #HongKong is to be restricted, but borders will remain open, says Chief Exec. Carrie Lam, in light of the #WuhanCoronavirus. pic.twitter.com/5BzSbRF1iK
‚Äî Hong Kong Free Press (@HongKongFP) January 28, 2020

Jiao Yahui, deputy head of the NHC‚Äôs medical administration bureau, said during a press conference Tuesday that shortages of medical supplies in Wuhan were still a serious problem.
CDC has issued new travel recommendations urging people to avoid all non-essential trips. But officials remained reluctant to declare a global emergency, instead insisting that this is merely an emergency ‚Äúin China‚Äù. Of course, after yesterday‚Äôs brutal pullback, that‚Äôs to be expected.
The big piece of evidence that the WHO is purportedly looking for is human-to-human transmission outside China. Zhong Nanshan, a leading expert on SARS and other communicable diseases in China, confirmed human-to-human transmission in at least one case in Wuhan and two cases in Guangdong Province. Meanwhile, as we noted yesterday, one case of possible human-to-human transmission is being investigated in Canada, while Vietnam and Japan have now each confirmed one cases. Japan revealed on Tuesday that a bus driver in his 60s, who recently carried passengers from Wuhan, has been found to have the virus.
During a meeting in Beijing, President Xi told World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus that the safety of the people is his government‚Äôs first priority, and that he recognizes the situation is ‚Äúvery serious.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis was supposed to be a time for rest, but because of the pneumonia outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus, the Chinese people right now are faced with a very serious battle,‚Äù Xi said. ‚ÄúThis is something we take very seriously because in our view nothing matters more than people‚Äôs safety and health. That is why I myself have been personally deploying, planning, and guiding all the efforts related to containment and mitigation of the outbreak.‚Äù
That‚Äôs ironic, considering Beijing‚Äôs sluggish response after the first cases were discovered in December. After all, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang on Tuesday spoke out against the deluge of criticism he has faced to accuse Beijing of tying his hands. This comes after President Xi and the party tried to scapegoat him and other local party officials for the crisis.
This was supposed to be a time for rest, but because of the pneumonia outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus, the Chinese people right now are faced with a very serious battle,‚Äù Chinese President Xi Jinping tells in Beijing.
Speaking at a press briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, Jiao Yahui, deputy head of the NHC‚Äôs medical administration bureau, said shortage of medical supplies was a major constraint in China‚Äôs efforts to contain the outbreak and treat infected people.
Tens of thousands of patients are under observation in China after displaying one or more symptoms of the virus. In the US, roughly 100 people are in isolation. But former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb told CNBC that China is obscuring the true number of cases ‚Äì a suspicion that‚Äôs widely held among American infectous-disease experts.
According to some projections, there might be up to 300,000 cases in China, and there are likely dozens of people who have died of pneumonia who in reality died from nCoV ‚Äì but those deaths will never be recorded. Although China is ‚Äúbehaving better‚Äù than it did during the SARS outbreak, they‚Äôre still concealing information from the international community.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still not behaving well. They‚Äôre concealing information, including the spread to health care workers, which we didn‚Äôt know until last week‚Äù Gottlieb said.
China is already in a ‚Äúfull-blown epidemic.‚Äù The US will likely face some limited outbreaks, but Gottlieb said we have the tools to suppress the virus and prevent the same thing from happening in the US.
Jiao said China was sending about 6,000 medical personnel to Hubei from around the country ‚Äì with more than 4,000 already there and 1,800 more due to arrive by Tuesday evening ‚Äì to work in Wuhan and seven other cities in the province. In Wuhan, more than 10,000 hospital beds have been made available for patients, he said, while another 100,000 are being prepared.
In Beijing, CNBC‚Äôs Eunice Yoon reported that the local government is strongly encouraging the wearing of facemasks in public. Police guarding Beijing‚Äôs public transit are wearing full hazmat suits, and anybody hoping to board a train must be wearing a mask, and must submit to a temperature check via infrared thermometer. If an individual is found to have a fever, they‚Äôre sent to a hospital to be quarantined.
As Beijing tries to telegraph to the world that it has the situation under control, health experts have raised new questions about the government‚Äôs response. One infectious disease specialist told the NYT that they were skeptical about the Wuhan quarantine‚Äôs ability contain the virus (unsurprising considering that 5 million left the city before the lockdown began). Beijing and Guangzhou, a port city northwest of Hong Kong, have broken ground on new hospitals, mimicking the speedy construction of not one but two new hospitals in Wuhan to treat patients infected with the virus. Beijing is also reopening a hospital used to fight the SARS outbreak in 2003, while 6,000 medical staff have been sent to Hubei.

"5 million potential carriers have left Wuhan, Coronavirus now ‚Äúmore transmissible‚Äù","Over the weekend, there were numerous media reports published in hopes of easing fears that the coronavirus spread was uncontained, and informing the general public just how seriously China takes its quarantine of no less than 17 cities and roughly 60 million people. Take this report from AFP, according to which Police at a roadblock on the outskirts of Wuhan turned away cars trying to leave the virus-stricken epicenter on Saturday, as other anxious residents trapped inside spent the Lunar New Year stocking up on masks and medical supplies.
‚ÄúAuthorities have prevented anyone from leaving Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the heart of the viral outbreak which has so far infected nearly 1,300 people and killed 41 others‚Äù AFP writes adding that its reporters saw ‚Äúa steady trickle of cars approaching the roadblocks around 20 kilometres (12 miles) east of the city centre on Saturday morning, only for police in fluorescent jackets wearing masks to tell them to turn around.‚Äù
The barricade, at one of the tolls for highways exiting the city, was blocked with red and yellow plastic barriers and cones.
‚ÄúNobody can leave,‚Äù a policeman told AFP.
Yet, but‚Ä¶ there is just one problem: the much needed quarantine and lockdown were far too late, because as Wuhan‚Äôs mayor Zhou Xianwang revealed on Sunday during a press conference, about 5 million residents had already left Wuhan before the lockdown because of the deadly coronavirus epidemic and the Spring Festival holiday.¬† As the SCMPreports, many of Wuhan‚Äôs residents had already left the city for the holiday, while others rushed out after the lockdown was announced on Wednesday night.
As a result, only 9 million people were remaining in the city after the lockdown, with roughly a third of it, including countless cases of coronavirus, having already spread across China.
Meanwhile, in Chinese health officials ¬≠warned the virus‚Äô ¬≠ability to spread was getting ¬≠stronger, and in the worst possible news for China, Ma Xiaowei, the minister in charge of China‚Äôs National Health Commission (NHC), told a press conference that battling the outbreak had become especially complicated, after it was discovered that the new virus could be transmitted even during incubation period, which did not happen with Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome).
In other words, as many as tens if not hundreds of thousands of Coronavirus carriers quietly fled, and may have infected as many as 3-4 other people each, depending on the R0 of the virus.
‚ÄúFrom observations, the virus is capable of transmission even during incubation period,‚Äù Ma said, adding that the incubation period lasted from one to 14 days. ‚ÄúSome patients have normal temperatures and there are many milder cases. There are hidden carriers,‚Äù he said.
As for the piece de resistance, Ma said also that the virus had adapted to humans and appeared to have become more transmissible: ‚ÄúThere are signs showing the virus is becoming more transmissible. These walking ‚Äòcontagious agents‚Äô [hidden carriers] make controlling the outbreak a lot more difficult.‚Äù
Even China‚Äôs authorities sounds like they are giving up: Li Bin, deputy minister of the NHC said the authorities that the severe measures they had taken to control the spread of the virus ‚Äì such as issuing travel bans and locking down cities ‚Äì would at least delay the peak and ‚Äúbuy time to combat the next stage of the outbreak‚Äù, according to SCMP.
Yes, China is already bracing for ‚Äúthe next stage of the outbreak.‚Äù
To help tackle the epidemic, which has closed off 17 cities, Ma said that 2,360 military and civilian doctors and nurses had been sent to Wuhan, the city in which the outbreak was first detected at the end of last month. As the pressure has mounted on the city‚Äôs hospitals, the medical system has moved ever closer to collapse.
Many people who developed feverish symptoms were turned away by hospitals earlier in the week because there were not enough beds, local residents said earlier. Medical practitioners are also running seriously short of protective kits and are being forced to recycle goggles and masks. Ma said 2,400 hospital beds had been added in Wuhan, and the government was planning to add 5,000 more over the next three days.
Wang Jiangping, China‚Äôs vice-minister of industry and information technology, said China had the capacity to produce a maximum of 30,000 protective outfits per day, but that was less than a third of what was needed in Hubei.
Meanwhile, the hunt for the real source of the pandemic continues. China imposed a nationwide ban on wildlife trade on Sunday, as the outbreak was originally suspecteded to have originated at a seafood market in Wuhan, which also sold wild animals. However, a research paper published by medical journal The Lancet on Saturday said the first confirmed case of the viral infection was a person who had not been to that market.
Which begs the question we asked on Saturday: Did China Steal Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponize It?",2020-01-26T17:35:07+00:00,https://www.intellihub.com/5-million-potential-carriers-have-left-wuhan-coronavirus-now-more-transmissible/

Update (1920ET): As Friday begins in Beijing, Chinese state media has announced that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in mainland China has climbed to 830, while the number of deaths has climbed to 25
Meanwhile, more disturbing videos out of Wuhan are circulating online as reports about a growing number of sick health-care workers circulate in the Hong Kong press.

In other news, US lawmakers are set to be briefed on the virus Friday morning.

Update (1750ET): Japan‚Äôs health ministry confirmed a second case of coronavirus on Friday, reported¬†Reuters.
The infected man who lives in Wuhan, China, traveled to Japan on Sunday ‚Äî has been hospitalized in Tokyo, the health ministry said in a statement.
Details are limited at the moment. There was no mention of how many people the infected man came in contact with before being quarantined. New reports out of the UK are claiming that 14 people are now being tested for the virus after earlier reports said 3 people in Scotland were under quarantine as suspected carriers of the virus.
Meanwhile, the number of cities in Hubei province facing a travel ban/lockdown/quarantine has been expanded to eight: Wuhan, Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi, Xiantao, Qianjiang, Zhijiang and Lichuan.
SCMP has also released some more details about the first death outside of Hubei: An 80-year-old man died in the town of Hebei after spending two months in Wuhan visiting relatives.
Back in Wuhan, ride-share company Didi has suspended its service, as China‚Äôs finance ministry announced that 1 billion yuan ($144 million) would be used by Hubei authorities to halt the spread of the illness.
Also, in the latest sign that the regime in Beijing hasn‚Äôt kept its promise of complete transparency, the SCMP reports that health-care workers in Wuhan are getting sick at a rate that is faster than previously revealed. Initially, Chinese authorities insisted that health care workers weren‚Äôt being sickened, indicating that the virus didn‚Äôt spread via human to human contact. But we‚Äôve since learned that this was a lie.
Fifteen cases of the coronavirus have been officially reported among health care workers in the city, though doctors say the real number is much higher.
Just as we expected, the situation in Wuhan has gotten so out of hand that videos of health-care workers collapsing from exhaustion are circulating online.

‚Äî Gregor Peter (@L0gg0l) January 23, 2020

If it seems like every person who managed to escape Wuhan is carrying the virus, here‚Äôs one possible explanation: the WHO estimated that the coronavirus has a Ro (a measure of how contagious a virus is) of 2, equivalent to the Spanish flu that sickened 500 million during the first half of the 20th century. The common flu, by comparison, has a Ro of 0.9.
* * *
Update (1600ET): Markets recovered on Thursday after the WHO declined to label the coronavirus as a global pandemic threat (though we suspect they might change their view once the market has closed).
But now that Beijing‚Äôs shock-and-awe approach to containing the viral panic appears to have convinced health officials that the virus won‚Äôt make it to the next generation of transmission, it‚Äôs worth remembering that Beijing‚Äôs attempt to quarantine more than 20 million people was hardly comprehensive.
For examples, look at this Vice story, which claims one woman evaded airport checks by taking medication that lowered a fever. According to Vice, the Chinese embassy in Paris is hoping to speak with her after she visited a Michelin-starred restaurant and shared the whole experience on WeChat.
The warning came after one woman from Wuhan took medicine to bring down her temperature to avoid detection as she boarded a flight to France, where she dined at a Michelin-starred restaurant.
The woman was heavily criticized for her actions after she posted photos and details of her trip on WeChat. On Wednesday night the Chinese embassy in France responded with a warning and asked the woman to contact their emergency phone number.
Some people won‚Äôt let the risk of contagion spoil their holiday plans.

‚Äî Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) January 23, 2020

From The Scientist:
Ralph Baric, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill‚Ä¶ published a study on his team‚Äôs efforts to engineer a virus with the surface protein of the SHC014 coronavirus, found in horseshoe bats in China, and the backbone of to one that causes human-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mice. The hybrid virus could infect human airway cells and caused disease in mice, according to the team‚Äôs results, which were published in Nature Medicine.
The results demonstrate the ability of the SHC014 surface protein to bind and infect human cells, validating concerns that this virus‚Äîor other coronaviruses found in bat species‚Äîmay be capable of making the leap to people without first evolving in an intermediate host, Nature reported. They also reignite a debate about whether that information justifies the risk of such work, known as gain-of-function research. ‚ÄúIf the [new] virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory,‚Äù Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, told Nature.
Study allowed to continue
Despite government efforts to put an end to the study of virus Ralph Baric‚Äôs study continued on.
From The Scientist:
In October 2013, the US government put a stop to all federal funding for gain-of-function studies, with particular concern rising about influenza, SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). ‚ÄúNIH [National Institutes of Health] has funded such studies because they help define the fundamental nature of human-pathogen interactions, enable the assessment of the pandemic potential of emerging infectious agents, and inform public health and preparedness efforts,‚Äù NIH Director Francis Collins said in a statement at¬†the time. ‚ÄúThese studies, however, also entail biosafety and biosecurity risks, which need to be understood better.‚Äù
Baric‚Äôs study on the SHC014-chimeric coronavirus began before the moratorium was announced, and the NIH allowed it to proceed during a review process, which eventually led to the conclusion that the work did not fall under the new restrictions, Baric told Nature. But some researchers, like Wain-Hobson, disagree with that decision.
The Coronavirus is patented in the United States
The Coronavirus was patented in 2015 (U.S. Patent # 10130701) by the Pirbright Institute. (i.e. the virus can essentially be considered a bioweapon)
A description of the Coronavirus patent reads: ‚ÄúThe present invention provides a live, attenuated coronavirus comprising a variant replicase gene encoding polyproteins comprising a mutation in one or more of non-structural protein(s) (nsp)-10, nsp-14, nsp-15 or nsp-16. The coronavirus may be used as a vaccine for treating and/or preventing a disease, such as infectious bronchitis, in a subject.‚Äù
Media coverup
There has been an immense effort by Chinese state media to coverup the magnitude of the outbreak and the World Health Organization is dragging its feet as usual.
The Trump administration has failed to halt all incoming travel from countries of infectious origin and martial law is already underway in China, just one week in.
Ladies and gentlemen, I hate to be the first to break the bad news to you but the United States will likely soon follow lockstep.
At best we are looking at a number of people in the U.S. falling ill. The virus that has already reportedly killed a reported 17 people and probably a lot more unofficially.
At worst we are looking at full-scale pandemic Level 5 martial law which will result in quarantines and food shortages. Such a scenario could then ultimately lead to riots and all of this could happen faster than you may think.
As you are reading this report authorities in various U.S. states including Texas, Washington State, and California have already or are already quietly beginning to activate state pandemic preparedness plans.
Pandemic Level 5 martial law
If pandemic Level 5 martial law is reached quarantines will be put into place at state, local, and national levels.
According to law anyone in violation of a quarantine order can be charged a fine of $250,000 and be locked up possibly even in a FEMA camp or even worse ‚Äî they can shoot you.

"Deadly Wuhan coronavirus now inside U.S., CDC confirms","(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî The deadly China-spawned Wuhan coronavirus that has already killed 9 and infected hundreds abroad has reached the United States according to a Center for Disease Control and Prevention announcement on Tuesday confirming the first case.
From the CDC:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today confirmed the first case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in the United States in the state of Washington. The patient recently returned from Wuhan, China, where an outbreak of pneumonia caused by this novel coronavirus has been ongoing since December 2019. While originally thought to be spreading from animal-to-person, there are growing indications that limited person-to-person spread is happening. It‚Äôs unclear how easily this virus is spreading between people.
The patient from Washington with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection returned to the United States from Wuhan on January 15, 2020. The patient sought care at a medical facility in the state of Washington, where the patient was treated for the illness. Based on the patient‚Äôs travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected this new coronavirus. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC overnight, where laboratory testing yesterday confirmed the diagnosis via CDC‚Äôs Real time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (rRT-PCR) test.
CDC has been proactively preparing for the introduction of 2019-nCoV in the United States for weeks, including:
First alerting clinicians on January 8, 2020, to be on the look-out for patients with respiratory symptoms and a history of travel to Wuhan, China.
Developing guidance for clinicians for testing and management of 2019-nCoV, as well as guidance for home care of patients with 2019-nCoV.
Developing a diagnostic test to detect this virus in clinical specimens, accelerating the time it takes to detect infection. Currently, testing for this virus must take place at CDC, but in the coming days and weeks, CDC will share these tests with domestic and international partners
On January 17, 2020, CDC began implementing public health entry screening at San Francisco (SFO), New York (JFK), and Los Angeles (LAX) airports. This week CDC will add entry health screening at two more airports ‚Äì Atlanta (ATL) and Chicago (ORD).
CDC has activated its Emergency Operations Center to better provide ongoing support to the 2019-nCoV response.
CDC is working closely with the state of Washington and local partners. A CDC team has been deployed to support the ongoing investigation in the state of Washington, including potentially tracing close contacts to determine if anyone else has become ill.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses, some causing respiratory illness in people and others circulating among animals including camels, cats and bats. Rarely, animal coronaviruses can evolve and infect people and then spread between people, such as has been seen with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). When person-to-person spread has occurred with SARS and MERS, it is thought to happen via respiratory droplets with close contacts, similar to how influenza and other respiratory pathogens spread. The situation with regard to 2019-nCoV is still unclear. While severe illness, including illness resulting in several deaths, has been reported in China, other patients have had milder illness and been discharged. Symptoms associated with this virus have included fever, cough and trouble breathing.¬† The confirmation that some limited person-to-person spread with this virus is occurring in Asia raises the level of concern about this virus, but CDC continues to believe the risk of 2019-nCoV to the American public at large remains low at this time.
This is a rapidly evolving situation. CDC will continue to update the public as circumstances warrant.

"COVID-19 updates: Military presence, lawlessness, push for gas bans, gun bans,...","(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî Things are developing fast on the COVID-19 front and there is no end in sight to current government overreach and numerous breaches of the United States Constitution.
The ‚Äúinvisible enemy‚Äù as President Donald Trump refers to it has now led to the government actually moving toward banning and criminalizing gun sales, gas sales, and even the stockpiling of essential items in this time of crisis.
That‚Äôs right, the Department of Justice recently announced that a number of hoarders are already under investigation will receive a knock on their door from government agents who wish to monitor¬†Americans‚Äô cell phone location data along with their credit card and bank transaction history.
Somehow, almost overnight in the name of ‚Äúthe invisible enemy‚Äù the United States has been nearly transformed into an early Nazi Germanyesk police state in which military assets are currently being positioned regional or even a national lockdown.
Right now in Dallas, Texas if you are caught outside without the proper paperwork you will be arrested and fined $10,000 and Dallas isn‚Äôt the only city this is happening in either. This comes after a shelter-in-place order was issued on Monday for all of Dallas County.
To boot, residents claim that no warning was given before the order went into effect which essentially confines them to their homes until April 2. However, U.S. government officials including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo are now talking about an 18 month-long lockdown for the entire state of New York and possibly the entire United States. Taking into consideration that residents can likely go no more than 2 weeks with their current food stash and on-hand supplies how would they be expected to survive even a full month let alone 18?
Additionally, it is important to note that the number of cases is compounding and will soon overwhelm hospitals, morgues, and crematoriums across the country. That‚Äôs why the U.S. military is currently setting up makeshift morgues outside of hospitals. Existing morgues have nearly reached capacity.
And let‚Äôs not forget about the mass graves that I exposed back in March of 2009. They are primed and ready to start accepting dead Americans.
One-third of the entire planet has been put on lockdown due to ‚Äúthe invisible enemy.‚Äù That‚Äôs why the U.S. government is expecting over 3 million deaths just in California over the next several weeks alone.
Let‚Äôs run the math. Shall we?
40,000,000 residents in California are currently under lockdown
CDC says 58% of Californians will become infected with ¬†COVID-19 within the next 8 weeks
23 million to be infected, according to CDC (at 58% of pop.)
Confirmed 16% kill rate (according to Intellihub exclusive report) (18% in Iran)
Even at a 1%-3% kill rate (official story)
Calculating‚Ä¶
WTF?
40,000,000 residents in California. @CDC says 58% infected with #Covid_19 next 8 weeks in Cali‚Ä¶ 16% kill rate .. that is 3,712,000 deaths in next two weeks. Take note of confirmed 16% kill rate listed off low numbers https://t.co/z1W3oYW0r0 #coronavirus #CALockdown #MartialLaw

Additionally, it is important to point out that President Trump is still mulling shutting down entire FEMA regions and possibly the entire country yet banter at the White House podium still offers hope to American workers who wish to hold on to the dream.
And we can‚Äôt forget about the number of National Guard troops who have been deployed. Some 10,000 now in total.

Papers, please
What boggles me is that everyone is just sitting back and watching it all happen. I mean, grocery stores in most cities are already cleared out and resupplies are limited.
To travel within locked-down areas you need a ‚Äúcritical infrastructure‚Äù pass. If you don‚Äôt already have one you likely will not be getting one and will not be allowed to travel.
Now, New York City is weighing closing the streets entirely to the general public which would essentially confine 8 million people to their homes for an 18 month period.
Who will feed them?
What will happen if the president declares a national ‚Äôemergency‚Äô due to the coronavirus?
If President Donald Trump were to declare a national emergency due to the coronavirus it will put FEMA, referred to as ‚Äúthe secret government‚Äù by some, at the helm of the country and will essentially suspend the U.S. constitution altogether under enacted executive orders.
Several Executive Orders that would suspend the U.S. Constitution are as follows, via dmc.members.sonic.net:
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare functions.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period.
EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in U.S. financial institution in any undefined national emergency. It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months.

The deep state can literally use this to their advantage to envoke the 25th Amendment especially if President Donald Trump were ever to be quarantined for any reason.
From AP:
Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has tested positive for the novel coronavirus, becoming the first case of COVID-19 in the Senate and raising fears about the further transmission of the virus among Republicans at the Capitol.
Paul, an eye surgeon, went into quarantine Sunday after learning his results. He said he has not had symptoms and was tested out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events. He said he was not aware of any direct contact with any infected person.
His announcement led Utah‚Äôs two GOP senators ‚Äî Mike Lee and Mitt Romney ‚Äî to place themselves into quarantine, stepping away from negotiations as the Senate worked on a $1.4 trillion economic rescue package for the coronavirus crisis.

Follow him on Twitter @Barnes_Law
Panics from pandemics unleash unchecked governmental power. The very premise of popular films like V for Vendetta reveal this: a group uses a virus to seize power and create a totalitarian society. Anyone could witness this from far-off lands, watching the news about China locking people up in their own homes and then removing them screaming from those homes whenever the state wanted. World War I and the Great Depression birthed virulent forms of governments with leaders like Hitler, Mao, Mussolini and Stalin.
Governments across America already used the pandemic, and the media-stoked panic around the pandemic particularly, to limit, restrict or remove First Amendment freedoms of speech and free association, with officials complaining about the potential restraints the freedom of religion imposed upon them. Others denied or declared the right to deny Second Amendment rights of gun purchase for personal safety (at a time governments are issuing no-arrest and no-detention orders for a wide range of crimes in their community while publicly freeing inmates from jails and prisons). They want to coordinate with tech companies to surveil and spy on your everyday movements and activities, in violation of the Fourth Amendment and potentially waive, unilaterally, your medical right to privacy in multiple contexts. Stay-at-home orders deprive you of your profession, occupation, business and property, without any due process of law at all beyond an executive fiat in violation of the Fifth Amendment right to due process. Governments request the authority to involuntarily imprison any American on mere fear of infection without any probable cause of crime or clear and present danger of harm by that person‚Äôs volitional conduct, deny access to personal counsel in an unsupervised, un-surveilled manner in violation of the Sixth Amendment, and act as judge, jury and executioner in violation of the Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury, as jury trials themselves get suspended around the country in the nation‚Äôs quieted courts and fear-muted public.
The real pandemic threat is here. It‚Äôs the panic that will quarantine our Constitution.
First Amendment Quarantined?
Already, governments in America suspended the First Amendment freedom of millions of citizens with shutdown, stay-at-home, curfew orders that prohibit obtaining a petition for a public protest, or even being physically present for a public protest. Indeed, even meetings in ‚Äúmore than ten‚Äù are prohibited by various governing jurisdictions within the United States. Surprising places like Missouri did so. Towns like Hartford did so. Maryland soon followed suit. The effect of the stay-at-home orders of New York, California, Nevada, Illinois and Pennsylvania effectively achieve the same outcome. Other governing officials recognized the dubious lawlessness of these orders, but remain outliers. Remember the Hong Kong protests? Gone. Remember the Yellow Vest protests? Soon to be gone. Seen any protests on American streets today? A pandemic is here. Protests gone. Constitution quarantined.
Second Amendment Quarantined?
But that is not all. Under the guise of ‚Äúunnecessary businesses,‚Äù ‚Äúemergencypowers,‚Äù or simply by furloughing or reducing staff in the background checks department, governments show the willingness to limit Second Amendment rights as well as First Amendment protections. Mayors declare the right to ban gun sales, governments declare no background-check personnel to process a background check, delaying gun sales indefinitely, and other governments simply shut down all gun sales businesses entirely. Most worrisome, this happens while governments release inmates into the streets, and discussreleasing even more, and, at the same time, issue no-arrest and no-detention orders from Philadelphia to Fort Worth for a wide range of criminals. Want to defend yourself, give yourself a deep sense of personal protection that comes with gun ownership for many, as the Second Amendment safeguards? Well, no luck, according to too many of our governing overlords. A pandemic is here. Self-protection sacrificed. Constitution quarantined.
Fourth Amendment Quarantined?
Few protections are more American than the right to privacy against coerced, compelled, secretive, subversive invasion. The government operates like a virus in a case of a pandemic panic, infecting our minds and bodies, monitoring speech, association and movement, with tools of surveillance unthought-of to the founders. Coordinating with private companies (unrestrained by the Fourth Amendment; why do you think NSA uses them to gather all your emails, conversations, texts, and internet searches, at the first stage?), governments used the panic about the pandemic, a panic the government itself stoked with aid of a compliant, complicit press, to waive your medical privacy and invade your personal privacy, looking for tools to monitor your every movement, associations, activities, and behavior. The watching eye in the sky can now be the Alexa in your home, the camera on your computer, and the phone in your hand. A pandemic is here. Privacy ended. Constitution quarantined.
Fifth Amendment Quarantined?
The protection for our right to make a living arises from the Fifth Amendment right to property without deprivation by due process of law, and the obligation for the government to compensate any such takings. Yet, governments across America did just that to millions of businesses, workers, and property owners, stripping them of their ability to make a living, or even to engage in a free market of commerce, by shutdown orders, curfews, and stay-at-home orders. The political and professional class ensconced in its work-from-home environs fails to appreciate the hardship this imposes on working people. No compensation. No substitution. No wages. No revenues. No opportunity. Labor lost that can never be recovered, ever, while it leaves our economy teetering on the edge of a worst-ever depression. The foundation of government is to protect the pursuit of happiness. Now all we get to pursue is Netflix-and-chill and hope miracles happen to pay next week‚Äôs bills, and pray the market doesn‚Äôt crash like in 1929. A pandemic is here. Opportunity & property gone. Constitution quarantined.
Conclusion
Our founders were intimately familiar with pandemics, viruses and plagues, yet they did not allow any to suspend our Constitutional liberties. Not one word in the Constitution about plagues or pandemics to exempt the government from any of our Bill of Rights. Why do our current courts allow it? Because the public is asleep at the wheel. Think the pandemic threatens to kills us all? A review of the data shows the pandemic is more panic than plague.
Time to wake up. Maybe it is time in the motto of V for Vendetta, to ‚ÄúRemember, remember the fifth of November, the gunpowder treason and plot.‚Äù As that film‚Äôs lead character well said: ‚ÄúPeople shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of their government. Governments should be afraid of their people.‚Äù Only when an awake public asserts their human liberties to protest the loss of their liberties will, then, governments quit using public health crises to seize power that does not belong to them.

"Trump declares ‚Äúnational emergency‚Äù as military moves into 8 states, shutdowns,...","WASHINGTON (INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday ahead of nationwide city lockdowns and the incremental shutdown of society.
The Pentagon has activated Continuity of Government (COG) at the highest level as COVID-19 seeds the land spreading undetected from person-to-person during its 24 to 27 day incubation period.
National Guard¬†troops began their deployment in 8 states on Friday¬†as the general public continues to buy and hoard presumably essential supplies to ride out the pandemic.
The governors of California, Maryland, Washington, Rhode Island, New York, Lousiana, and Florida continue to move toward ordering the complete lockdown of entire towns and cities.
President Trump said during a White House press conference on Friday that the country has now entered a different phase in the fight to mitigate the coronavirus and made clear that measures the government will be taking over the coming days will save countless lives.
‚ÄúTo release the full power of the federal government with this effort today I am officially declaring a national emergency,‚Äù Trump said at a White House press conference. ‚ÄúThe action that I am taking will open up access for $50 billion‚Ä¶ to fight against this disease.‚Äù
Trump called on governors in all states to activate their emergency operations centers immediately and ordered hospitals across the U.S. to activate their emergency preparedness plans.
Shockingly, the new emergency orders will broaden the authority of the Department of Human Health Services (HHS) which, in a nutshell, allows for law enforcement and military to detain anyone suspected of being infected or suspected of having come in contact with the infected.
Additionally, the president confirmed that the secretary of HHS will coordinate with both hospitals and the government to waive laws that will allow the fast-tracking of treatment.
Trump to have sweeping powers under coronavirus emergency
Via Mint Press News:
The decision to classify government coronavirus preparations in mid-January, followed by the decision to coordinate the domestic response with the military and with intelligence deserves considerable scrutiny, particularly given that at least one federal agency, Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), will be given broad, sweeping powers and will work closely with unspecified intelligence ‚Äúpartners‚Äù as part of its response to a pandemics like¬†COVID-19.
The CBP‚Äôs pandemic response document, obtained by The Nation, reveals that the CBP‚Äôs pandemic directive ‚Äúallows the agency to actively surveil and detain individuals suspected of carrying the illness indefinitely.‚Äù The Nation¬†further notes¬†that the plan was drafted during the George W. Bush administration, but is the agency‚Äôs most recent pandemic response plan and remains in effect.
Though only CBP‚Äôs pandemic response plan has now been made public, those of other agencies are likely to be similar, particularly on their emphasis on surveillance, given past precedent following the September 11 attacks and other times of national panic. Notably, several recent media reports have likened¬†coronavirus¬†to 9/11¬†and broached the possibility of¬†a ‚Äú9/11-like‚Äù response¬†to coronavirus, suggestions that should concern critics of the post-9/11 ‚ÄúPatriot Act‚Äù and other controversial laws, executive orders and policies that followed.
While the plans of the federal government remain classified, recent reports have revealed that the military and intelligence communities ‚Äî now working with the NSC to develop the government‚Äôs coronavirus response ‚Äî have anticipated a massive explosion in cases for weeks. U.S. military intelligence came to the conclusion over a month ago¬†that coronavirus cases would reach ‚Äúpandemic proportions‚Äù domestically by the end of March. That military intelligence agency, known as the National Center for Medical Intelligence (NCMI), coordinates closely¬†with the National Security Agency (NSA) to conduct ‚Äúmedical SIGINT [signals intelligence].‚Äù
The coming government response, the agencies largely responsible for crafting it and its classified nature deserve public scrutiny now, particularly given the federal government‚Äôs tendency to not let ‚Äúa serious crisis to go to waste,‚Äù as former President Obama‚Äôs then-chief of staff Rahm Emanuel infamously said¬†during the 2008 financial crisis. Indeed, during a time of panic ‚Äî over a pandemic and over a simultaneous major economic downturn¬†‚Äî concern over government overreach is warranted, particularly now given the involvement of intelligence agencies and the classification of planning for an explosion of domestic cases that the government believes is only weeks away.

Beijing hospital confirms COVID-19 attacks central nervous system,"(INTELLIHUB) As quacks like Dr. Drew Pinsky go around telling the general public that COVID-19 is no more dangerous than the common flu real journalists and real doctors are warning that COVID-19 is far more deadly and are warning the disease attacks the central nervous system just as a manmade bioagent would.
CN Tech Post reports:
Beijing Ditan Hospital affiliated to the Capital Medical University said on March 4 that the first patient with novel coronavirus pneumonia complicated with encephalitis was discharged from the hospital on February 25.
Liu Jingyuan, director of the ICU at the Hospital, presided over the treatment of the patient. He reminded that patients with conscious disturbances must consider the possibility that the virus may attack the central nervous system.
At present, patients with new type of coronavirus pneumonia can be combined with multiple organ damages such as severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocardial damage, abnormal coagulation function, kidney damage, liver damage, etc. However, no central nervous system involvement has been reported. The case report is the first in the world.
Previous studies on SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) have also shown that the coronaviruses that cause these two diseases also cause cases of central nervous system damage.
This is exactly why fake doctors like ole Drew should leave it to the experts.

To that end, HHS and FEMA agreed to use a federal facility, the FEMA Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama, as a place for some of the American passengers from the Diamond Princess to stay.

The passengers who will stay at the Center tested positive for COVID-19, although at this time they either do not have symptoms or have mild flu-like symptoms. Any of the evacuees who become seriously ill will be transported to pre-identified hospitals for medical care. Under the HHS-FEMA agreement, the Center for Domestic Preparedness will provide the housing, and HHS will provide basic medical care and all other support services for these returning passengers. Passengers will stay in a separate area from the Center‚Äôs training participants and will remain at the Center until they are medically cleared.

Where did all the bodies go? Highrise has only 7 tenant...,"HUBEI PROVENCE, China (INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî Only about 7 rooms remain lit up in a city highrise that usually has hundreds upon hundreds of tenant families.
David Ng Tweets:
Many tweeters only rely on the information on Twitter and have no idea of the current horrors in Wuhan! This photo was taken by my friend in Wuhan in an instant! Opposite his house is a ‚Äú30-storey‚Äù high-rise building, and now only ‚Äú7 households‚Äù are on!¬†The entire building is usually lit! Now Wuhan has really become a ghost town and raccoon market! There are only 5 households in his own home! Although it is an old house, it is also very exaggerated! How serious the epidemic is!

A second Tweet by David Ng elaborates on the current situation a bit more:
This 30-story residential building in Wuhan is not new! Usually, homes are lit! Now on the 30th floor, there are only 7 families left! Assuming 4 units on the ground floor (in fact, there will be more), the current situation of the building is only 5.8%! Plummeted 95%! Wuhan ran 5 million, and now 9 million, that is, 64% of the population is in Wuhan! How to explain the 95% drop in residential residents? ? Excluding those who ran away, there should be 77 lights in this building! There are only 7 households now!

10 plagues hitting earth simultaneously,"Intellihub editor‚Äôs note: We told you for years here at Intellihub that it was coming. Now it‚Äôs here. The world is a crazy place.¬†
From EndoftheAmericanDream.com:
All of a sudden, really crazy things are starting to happen all over the world.¬† Giant swarms of locusts are absolutely devastating entire regions, extremely unusual storms are confounding meteorologists, earthquake and volcanic activity are both on the rise, and five very dangerous diseases are sweeping across the globe.¬† So far in 2020, it has just been one thing after another, and many are speculating about what could be ahead if events continue to escalate.¬† The other day my wife mentioned that one of her friends suggested that I should put together a list of all the weird stuff that has been taking place, and so that is what I have decided to do.¬† The following is a list of 10 plagues that are hitting our planet simultaneously‚Ä¶
#1 Armies Of Locusts ‚Äì As I detailed the other day, swarms of locusts the size of major cities have been devouring entire farms in Africa in as little as 30 seconds.¬† These swarms have also been spreading throughout the Middle East, and now we have learned that they have even reached China‚Ä¶
A gigantic swarm of locusts that belong to a plague that has ravaged millions of acres of crops across east Africa has been spotted reaching the Chinese border.
Billions of the insects have destroyed food supplies across Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia in what has been described as the worst plague for decades.
#2 Extremely Bizarre Weather Patterns ‚Äì It is almost as if virtually all of the old rules have suddenly been thrown out the window.¬† An all-time record 209 mph wind gust just hit Calfiornia, and absolutely crazy storms are happening all over the planet.¬† For example, just check out what just took place in Australia‚Ä¶
Sydney has been thrown into chaos by a devastating storm that saw two months of rainfall in just two days ‚Äì forcing mass evacuations, leaving 150,000 homes without power, and prompted warnings not to drive to work. The storm dumped 400mm of rain on the city over the weekend, causing mayhem for commuters on Monday morning with roads blocked, ferries canceled and trains suffering major delays across the network.
#3 Unprecedented Flooding ‚Äì We are seeing unusual flooding all over the world right now, and the flooding that is devastating the southern U.S. at this moment is being called ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù‚Ä¶
In Jackson, Mississippi, hundreds of residents either watched their homes flood over the weekend or worried their residence would soon be drenched as the Pearl River crested Monday at 36.8 feet, its third-highest level ever recorded ‚Äì behind only 1979 and 1983.
Calling the Jackson floods ‚Äúhistoric‚Äù and ‚Äúunprecedented,‚Äù Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said in a Sunday press conference that ‚Äúwe do not anticipate this situation to end anytime soon. It will be days before we are out of the woods and the waters recede.‚Äù
#4 Major Earthquakes ‚Äì Really big earthquakes are happening with such frequency now that it is very difficult for me to write about them all.¬† For example, a magnitude 7.7 quake recently struck off of the coast of Jamaica, but I have been so busy writing about other disasters that I have not even mentioned it until now‚Ä¶
A magnitude 7.7 earthquake struck Tuesday about 80 miles from Jamaica, shaking people in the Caribbean and as far away as Miami.
A tsunami of 0.4 feet was recorded in the Cayman Islands at George Town, but no tsunami was observed at Port Royal, Jamaica, or Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic.
#5 Unusual Volcanic Eruptions ‚Äì Seismic activity has been rising all over the globe, and over the past couple of months we have seen volcanoes all over the world pop off like firecrackers.¬† One of the most notable eruptions that we have seen in recent days was the most powerful eruption of Mount Merapi in 90 years‚Ä¶
One of Indonesia‚Äôs most active volcanoes, Mount Merapi just experienced its most powerful eruption since 1930! The eruption reportedly took place on Thursday and was caught on video displaying a powerful and terrifying eruption showing the moment the crater exploded and launched lava and ash an estimated 2,000 meters into the air forcing local residents to stay outside of the designated no-go zone 3km (1.8 miles) from the crater.
#6 The Coronavirus ‚Äì Needless to say, the coronavirus outbreak in China has been getting more headlines than anything else on this list.¬† The numbers continue to rise, and many are speculating that this could potentially become the worst global pandemic since the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918.¬† In a desperate attempt to keep the truth from getting out, the World Health Organization is asking the major social media companies to censor their users‚Ä¶
The World Health Organization has held talks with tech giants to stop the spread of coronavirus ‚Äúmisinformation,‚Äù despite the fact that some things once labeled ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù have since turned out to be true.
The meeting was organized by the WHO but hosted by Facebook at its Menlo Park campus in California. Attendees included representatives from Amazon, Twilio, Dropbox, Google, Verizon, Salesforce, Twitter, YouTube, Airbnb, Kinsa and Mapbox.

San Diego County officials declare public health emergency for COVID-19: Use...,"SAN DIEGO COUNTY (INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî County officials declared a public health emergency on Friday triggering the silent activation of local emergency pandemic preparedness and fatality response plans.
The heightened state of emergency authorizes certain law enforcement and military personnel the right to detain anyone suspected of being infected with COVID-19 or anyone who may have had contact with someone who was infected with the deadly virus.
This essentially means that if authorities ask an infected person or person suspected of being infected to be quarantined and that person does not want to be quarantined, symptoms or not, the use of force is authorized. The CDC refers to this hunter-seeker offensive action as ‚Äúcontact tracing,‚Äù LOL.
The infected or suspected infected will one way or another be detained and taken to a camp located at the nearest military facility authorized to contain the deadly COVID-19 strain.
Roughly 230 people are being held in forced quarantine at Marine Corps Station Miramar in San Diego and the U.S. Department of Defence on Wednesday tasked NORTHCOM with a directive to ‚Äúrespond to and mitigate biological threats.‚Äù (i.e. any person or persons deemed to be infected or dangerous.)
The quarantine is expected to end next week but may be extended for 30 days, according to ABC 10.

Preparedness is happening on a local, state, and national level as the situation is anticipated to escalate in the coming days.
County health officer Wilma Wooten said in a statement: ‚ÄúLet us be clear, this does not mean there is any increased risk to the general public, in fact it is quite the opposite.‚Äù¬†However, her words of encouragement do not seem to reassure residents who fear the worst.
Two patients infected with the COVID-19 are currently being treated at UC San Diego Medical Center, Hillcrest.
So what does this all mean?
In a nutshell, silent martial law has been activated. From here on out locals will only see an increased military and law enforcement presence in the region.

Exclusive: Fmr hospital administrator reveals possible COVID19 connection to weaponized prions,"(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî Former hospital administrator Constance Klostermeier has shared information with Intellihub regarding the possible origin and composition of COVID-19 and how it may have been developed in a lab quite possibly making it one of the most deadly and indestructible contagions the world has ever seen.
In a back and forth with Intellihub Klostermeier writes:
I want to preface that there are tons of info on this topic. This is only the ‚Äúbird‚Äôs eye view‚Äù of why ‚Äúall these roads seem to lead to NOVID-19.‚Äù Here goes: Start with this link: published by American biologist Stanley Prusiner on 11/6/98 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. pnas.org/content/95/23/‚Ä¶ Eleven months earlier Prusiner received the 1998 Nobel Price in Medicine for his discovery of prions. He is now Director of the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases and Professor of Neurology and Biochemistry at UCSF. The link to his biography ishttps.www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicin‚Ä¶ .
[The] links are not working for his biography, but I can send it later in a document if you wish. In a nutshell, He was raised in Cincinnati (important as you will see later) and attended the University of Pennsylvania and eventually pursued postgraduate work at UCSF. His father was a Navy man, and Dr. Prusiner served as well. His interest in rare, degenerative disease found its ‚Äúfirst love‚Äù in a tribe in New Guinea who had exhibited an extremely rare and hellish disease named ‚ÄúKuru.‚Äù It was more prevalent among the women and children who (after a successful hunt of their fellows/enemies) ate the brains of the deceased. As a result, there were uncontrolled movements along with bizarre behavior and hysterical bouts of laughter. The length of this illness sometimes lasted for 12(+) or (-) months. Prions were discovered within the 5 or 6 known as TSEs (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies.) Among these are kuru, mad cow and others. Prions are not living organisms, and thus cannot be killed. They can be destroyed by lengthy burning at 2,000 C or more. They are a pathogen that is devoid of DNA, RNA and DEVOID OF NUCLEIC ACID (this point is critical.) As witnessed by scientists, prions can exist for decades or more‚Äìeven within formaldehyde. They can attach themselves even to stainless steel surfaces.
I might be skipping around a bit, but you‚Äôll see the connections. ScienceAlert.com published a paper on 6/7/2018 entitled ‚ÄúA Deadly Contagious Brain Protein was Just Made in the Lab for the First Time.‚Äù It addresses the first successful synthesis of artificial human prion. If you look at the article, please see the connection to neurologist Jiri G. Safar of Case Western Reserve School of Medicine (Cincinnati). They now have a National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center there. There are others around the world,d but difficult if not impossible to find. I am building up to a bombshell here, and I will try to be as succinct as possible.
In his paper entitled ‚ÄúTransmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies‚Äù (published just on 9/13/2019) stated ‚ÄúNo known cures or treatments for prion disease, and thus 100% fatal.‚Äù Question: Why is the US govt. putting so much funding into prion research when the US experiences only @ 300 cases/year. Worldwide, there are only 102 cases/million. BECAUSE prions are a pathogen that can possibly ‚Äúcure‚Äù Alzheimer‚Äôs/ dementia, etc. or destroy humanity as we know it. Internationally, prions (among the scientific/medical communities and intelligence agencies) know that this can be the deadliest bioweapon in history‚Äìeven more so than radiation, chemical warfare, and nuclear war. Radiation cannot destroy prions. ONE MORE part‚Ä¶the SHTF ‚Ä¶scenario is coming.
Defence.iQ is a website you HAVE to see. Within the article is a link to an ‚Äúupcoming CBRN Summit and LIVE EXERCISE in Geneva, Switzerland that took place recently: 11/11-13/2019. The website will list the agenda, and who is attending. It includes mostly top-ranking military from the USA, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, and NATO. It also includes the International Red Cross (Head of Weapon Contamination Unit) and the Head of the CBRN (Chemical, Bioweapon, Radiation, and Nuclear) Sector. Douglas Ryce, Exec. Officer for CBRN, US Dept. of Defense, Dept. of State, Health and Human Services and US Army as well as the armies of the other attending countries. Attendees are not named: only their positions are listed. You can download this list. OK! White House sent a letter of inquiry to the National Academy of Sciences (Marcia McNutt) inquiring about the possibility of a NOVID-19 bioweapons virus. See the connections now? Nat‚Äôl Academy is leading prion research and has billions invested. Why did WH send directly to this entity? In addition: Prions can ‚Äúmultiply‚Äù and synthesis as well as damage proteins by ‚Äúfolding‚Äù them. Their action is not immediate and can be dormant for decades. Now that this pathogen is synthesized‚Äìthere are innumerable possibilities for this as a bioweapon (especially attached to a virus). Every infection will be different. On Sunday, the pathogen mutated approx. 14 times within a controlled environment. The question is IF THIS IS SO‚Ä¶THEN THOSE WHO ARE TESTING NEGATIVE MAY BE POSITIVE. SO‚ÄìTHOSE PATIENTS DISCHARGED AS ‚ÄúCURED‚Äù COULD POSSIBLY BE CARRYING THE VIRUS AND FOR DECADES. so‚Ä¶ THIS IS TRUE BECAUSE PRIONS HAVE NO NUCLEIC ACIDS AND THE TEST THEY‚ÄôRE USING NOW ARE BASED ON NUCLEIC ACID.‚Äì All fetal life will be doomed as well, and the pathogen can easily ‚Äújump‚Äù between animal and human. If you‚Äôre still interested‚Ä¶let me know. I can continue researching. This needs to get out‚Äìpossibly via your news service and perhaps Infowars. How many WHO officials, doctors or scientists have said the word ‚Äúprion‚Äù in all of this?
‚Ä¶¬†The obvious symptoms and variety of this ‚Äúvirus‚Äù range from mild to fatal. If prions are involved‚Äìthose who have been cleared or are symptomatic can be deadly. Of course, it depends on the ‚Äúdesign‚Äù these scientists(?) put on it.
‚Ä¶¬†THIS NEEDS TO BE PUT OUT THERE NOW and with continued info and coverage. Think about those poor people with ‚Äúrigor like‚Äù movements at the end and the fact they‚Äôre showing ebola like bloodbath at the end. (Remarkable‚Äìonly MEN have shown this ‚Äúsymptom.‚Äù Keep in touch if you‚Äôd like. Have a good day and let me know if I can be of help. God bless you, brother. This is a FIGHT FOR THE TRUTH.
Additionally, it is important to point out that the incubation period may be up to 24 days, as reported by The Straits Times.

Presidential assistant Peter Navarro: ‚ÄúChina will have to be held accountable‚Äù...,"(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî Assistant to the President for trade Peter Navarro told Fox Business¬†on Thursday that China will have to be held accountable for how the COVID19 outbreak started and said the White House will be seeking answers.
Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo made clear during the broadcast that Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai did not deny that the coronavirus could have started in Wuhan‚Äôs P4 lab when he appeared on a Sunday show and said that could be the very reason that a Center for Disease Control (CDC) team may not have been allowed into China to asses and help.
‚ÄúIf they started this in a weapons lab, that is evidence that they are developing or are trying to develop weapons of mass destruction ‚Äî biological weapons,‚Äù Bartiromo told Navarro.

Navarro replied:
‚ÄúI think that the question of how this started ultimately has to be answered [but] I don‚Äôt think now is necessarily is the time to do that because we have to prevent the crisis first but China will have to be held accountable.‚Äù
Navarro went on to explain how 14 years ago, in a book he wrote, he actually predicted that a pandemic would emerge out of China due to the way they run their country.
‚ÄúI was very surprised that the Chinese ambassador did not answer that question,‚Äù he said.

DoD orders NORTHCOM: Plan to ‚Äúrespond to and mitigate biological threats‚Äù,"Snatch and grab teams have been approved and are now active on American soil!
American citizens suspected of being infected with COVID19 will be detained by military personnel before being quarantined at the closest military installation.
Citizens suspected of having come in contact with an infected person or persons will also be detained and quarantined at the nearest military installation.
(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî The U.S. Defense Department ordered Northern Command (NORTHCOM) on Wednesday to prepare to respond to and mitigate biological threats within the homeland putting emphasis on readiness levels at U.S. and allied installations and public health emergencies.
The order ‚Äúprovides direction to ensure mission assurance and readiness for public health emergencies.‚Äù (i.e. it‚Äôs a step by step playbook on how to set up and initiate martial law inside the U.S. ahead of a pandemic)
According to Reference F (REF/F/MSGID:DOC/YMD:20171204//) in the order:
MCO 6220.2 Disease Containment Planning which provides guidance to respond to and mitigate biological events with public health emergency implications and aligns organizational roles and responsibilities within the Marine Corps for Disease Containment Planning (DCP) activities.
Additionally, the order reveals that the ‚Äúcurrent threat of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus has raised concern that this virus could result in a pandemic disease.‚Äù
Rhetoric in the order suggests that the DoD is indeed expecting a full-fledged pandemic.
The Marine Corps‚Äô response to a pandemic outbreak focuses on five major areas:¬† 1) Force Health Protection (FHP); 2) Disease Containment Planning (DCP) and Readiness; 3) Continuity of Operations (COOP); 4) Defense Support of Civilian Authorities (DSCA); and 5) Support to U.S. Government response efforts.
The order goes on to state that the situation is ‚Äúrapidly evolving.‚Äù This can only mean one thing ‚Äî martial law is nigh.
Keep in mind, just one week ago I warned on record that martial law is coming.
Catch it all in the following video posted to YouTube titled Coronavirus Intel/Recon Request: Military vehicle and troop movements in CONUS ahead of martial law.

DoD: The military has mass quarantine camps set up in the...,"The United States military has set up mass quarantine camps in the United States to hoard people into. The Department of Defense has confirmed that the U.S. is following in China‚Äôs footsteps.
Areas to quarantine those infected with the coronavirus quickly become places similar to concentration camps and gulags. With China now forcing people from their homes and into mass quarantine camps, it might not be long before the police state in the U.S.comes crashing in to ‚Äúprotect and serve‚Äù the public.¬†Eleven military bases near major airports in the United States are setting up quarantine centers for possible coronavirus patients, the Department of Defense said. The¬†Department of Health and Human Services asked the Pentagon for quarantine space in case beds fill up at other coronavirus centers around the country, according to a DOD statement. Additionally, the Pentagon already agreed to house up to 1,000 people for quarantine¬†after they returned to the United States from areas with the virus, the Associated Press reports.
If you are traveling, a face mask is recommended, as that and good hand washing techniques are the two suggestions to prevent the contraction of this virus.¬† No one knows just how far this will go.¬† Right now, face masks are still few and far between, but some N100 face masks are becoming available again.

Pentagon approves quarantining Americans aginst their will on military bases amid...,"(INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî The Pentagon has approved quarantine camps, a.k.a. death camps, in the United States, to house American detainees suspected of being infected with the 2019-nCov Coronavirus or merely coming in contact with someone who was.
From MSN:
Defense Secretary Mark Esper is expected to support the request for the locations, which would be used ‚Äúshould HHS facilities become filled.‚Äù
The statement notes that the military facilities would house up to 20 people each ‚Äúas they undergo a period of quarantined observation,‚Äù but would be third in line to place individuals as ‚ÄúHHS already has primary and secondary locations identified that are not DOD facilities.‚Äù
However, the camps are not limited to people who have traveled from overseas as most media outlets make it out to be.
One report from CBS Sacramento reveals how the military will be snatching and grabbing regular everyday citizens off the streets.

The real truth of the matter is that just like in China when the camps become full or overwhelmed many people in them start dying.¬†In fact, the Chinese military had to build motes around the camps in an effort to detour detainees from escaping.
Keep in mind, wargaming such a scenario, one could simply be eating lunch at their favorite fast food place sometime in the near future when the military arrives and grabs everyone inside after an infected person was reported to have entered the establishment. Detainees would then be taken to a camp where if not infected already they will likely then become infected. Especially, being packed in with other sick and unruly people, anything could happen.¬†A good example of this is how people have been quarantined on cruise ships where the virus just keeps spreading adding to the number of infections until nobody is left.

Update (1830ET): While China currently has about 3,000 total cases as reported earlier, according to the latest report from China‚Äôs Center for Disease Control, the real number of infections may be substantially higher, because as of Jan 26 (the update for Jan 27 is due shortly) some 30,453 people are currently under observation for the coronavirus. Needless to say, it is very likely that a substantial number of these people will end up positive for the disease, even as the total of people under observation grows by thousands every single day.
Earlier in the day, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, China‚Äôs Hubei Province, is opening up 100,000 hospital beds in an effort to contain the disease, the province‚Äôs vice governor announced on Jan. 27. In a press conference on Jan. 27 evening, Hubei vice governor Yang Yunyan said authorities have designated 112 medical institutions to treat patients with the deadly novel coronavirus, according to Chinese state media. They have freed up around 100,000 hospital beds in the province, with 3,000 of them in Wuhan city alone, where the disease first broke out. As the Epoch Times observes, ‚ÄúThe urgency and scale of the authorities‚Äô orders have raised fears that the outbreak has spread far more widely than authorities admit.‚Äù

Naturally, the Task Force and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) have said they consider the infection risk to the Bavarian population to be low.
Finally, looking at the US where so far 5 cases have been confirmed, late on Monday the Maryland Department of Health confirmed a state resident was being tested for possibly having the coronavirus. They say the person is in ‚Äúgood condition‚Äù as they await results from the CDC laboratory. Similarly, the San Diego County Health Department also said it was investigating a possible case of the coronavirus. Test samples from the patient have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control for confirmation.
* * *Update (1415): The novel coronavirus has arrived in Cambodia and Sri Lanka, according to local health officials cited by Reuters and the Bangkok Post.
The virus has now been detected in a total of 17 countries/autonomous regions‚Ä¶

Fears that the outbreak will take a sizable chunk out of global GDP have festered amid reports that China‚Äôs ‚Äúmanufacturing nerve center‚Äù is shutting down as Beijing ‚Äúextends‚Äù the Lunar New Year holiday, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.
During the CDC press conference on Monday (which we covered in full below) the State Department announced an updated travel warning advising US citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to Hubei province, where the virus is believed to have originated, and to take necessary precautions when traveling in China.¬† While the warning maintained a Level 3 for China as a whole, the State Department raised the advisory to Level 4 for Hubei, the most severe warning possible. 
Though it doesn‚Äôt exactly take a genius-level intellect to ascertain that now isn‚Äôt a great time to travel to virus-plagued Hubei.

Update (1150ET): Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the Director of the Center for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), spoke on behalf of the CDC. During the press conference, she said that the US had identified 110 people who are under observation and being tested for the virus. While 5 cases have already been identified in the US, another 32 have definitively tested negative.
Though a vaccine remains elusive, the Messonnier said the CDC had developed a diagnostic test that can quickly confirm cases of the virus. So far, CDC researchers have seen no signs of ‚Äúmutation‚Äù in the virus. If the virus does mutate, as Chinese scientists suggested it might, that could create problems for those trying to develop the exam. On Friday, a ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù for the test was uploaded and shared with the world. All governments can now follow this blueprint to develop their own tests..
Right now, the CDC is focused on providing tests to ‚Äúpriority‚Äù states (presumably, Cali, Washington, Arizona and Illinois, the states where cases have been confirmed). But soon they will expand the program to supply governments in need.
The CDC has also uploaded the entire genome of the virus from the first two cases. From what the CDC can tell so far, the virus doesn‚Äôt appear to be ‚Äúmutating‚Äù, as some Chinese officials had suggested.
Messonnier stressed that this is a ‚Äúrapidly changing situation‚Äù both here and abroad, adding that the virus has spread to 16 countries from China.
‚ÄúOur thoughts are with the people on the front lines of this emerging health threat in China,‚Äù she said.
US airports are now screening passengers from Wuhan. The purpose of this is not just preventative: It‚Äôs intended to educate passengers about symptoms of the virus, and how to mitigate risk of infection while traveling abroad. The CDC recommends that travelers avoid all non-essential travel to Hubei province, and that anybody traveling to China should take certain precautions.
Returning travelers with symptoms may be asked to take precautionary measures.
Battered US stocks briefly spiked when Messonnier said that although a handful of cases have been identified in the US, the overall general health risk to the community remains ‚Äúlow at this time.‚Äù Still, she caveated this by insisting that the situation remains very much in flux.
Meanwhile, in China, more indications of the economic fallout from the outbreak have emerged: Zheijang, the country‚Äôs fourth-largest province by GDP, won‚Äôt allow companies to return to work until Feb. 8. Shanghai, an independent municipality within the province, announced similar measures earlier. The potential costs here in terms of lost productivity could measure in the hundreds of billions of dollars.
* * *
Update (1030ET): Chinese state media have just confirmed that Beijing has suffered its first confirmed death from the novel coronavirus. They also confirmed 8 new confirmed cases.
The total number of confirmed cases has climbed to 2882, though the true number of cases out there is likely much higher, as experts have warned.

Update(1000ET): US stocks are deep in the red Monday morning, on track for their worst day in four months, thanks to the fact that the market and the world realized over the weekend that the extremely infectious novel coronavirus has overwhelmed China‚Äôs capacity to contain it.
And right on time, here comes President Trump, with a weak attempt to pump the market.

The basics of a staged bioterror event,"‚ÄúDr. Hognose Detrick of the US Biological Warfare Group waddled into a meeting room, where a collection of Army, CIA, NSA, and HS representatives sat quietly in their chairs. He said: ‚ÄòSo I understand you boys want to put on a little domestic bioterror show, to keep the natives from becoming too restless. Well, the first thing you need to know is, germs don‚Äôt obey orders. Forget all that sci-fi nonsense. Germs work and they don‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs a crapshoot. You could have a big fat dud on your hands. I can tell you how to make it work, though, if you give up on your fancy high-tech wet dreams..‚Äù(The Underground, Jon Rappoport)
There are future scenarios which, with enough exposure before they happen, can be stopped‚Äîor at least analyzed correctly when they occur.
A staged bioterror event is one of those.
The primary fact is: no matter what kind of germ you‚Äôre talking about or where it came from, releasing it intentionally does not guarantee predictable results. Far from it.
For instance, people whose immune systems are at different levels of strength are going to react differently.
The perpetrators may find that less than 2% of people exposed get sick and die.
But there is another strategy that should be understood:
The use of a germ as a cover story for a chemical.
In other words, there is no germ attack. It‚Äôs called a germ attack, but that‚Äôs a lie. The perps bring in researchers, to the affected area, who go on to claim they have isolated a germ that is the cause of death and illness. It‚Äôs a sham. What really happened was the spread of a toxic chemical that can‚Äôt be detected, unless you‚Äôre looking for it.
The chemical has severe, deadly, and predictable effects for a week or two. Then it disperses and loses potency and the ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù is done.
In some town, a fairly isolated community, the word goes out that people are suddenly falling ill and dying. The CDC and the Army are called in to cordon off the area and quarantine all citizens. A peremptory announcement is made, early on, that this is a biowar attack.
Major media are allowed outside the periphery. Network news anchors set up on-location and do their wall to wall broadcasts ‚Äúfrom the scene.‚Äù
The entire nation, the entire world is riveted on the event, 24/7.
People inside the cordon fall ill and die. Reports emerge from the town:
The networks state that ‚Äúheroic doctors are taking samples of blood and the blood is being analyzed to find the germ that is causing the epidemic.‚Äù The DoD confirms over and over that this is, indeed, a biowar attack.
Human interest stories pile up. This family lost three members, that family lost everybody. Tragedy, horror, and the desired empathic response from ‚Äúthe world community.‚Äù
It‚Äôs a soap opera, except real people are dying.
The medical cartel promotes fear of the germ.
All controlling entities get to obtain their piece of the terrorist pie.
Finally, the doctors announce they have isolated the germ causing the death in the small town, and researchers are rushing to develop a vaccine (which they produce in record time).
Everyone everywhere must be vaccinated, now. No choice. Do it or be quarantined or jailed.
In this declared martial law situation, the doctors are the heroes. The doctors and the Army. And the government, and even the media.
Then, after a few weeks, when the potency of the secret chemical has dispersed, it‚Äôs over.
When you think about it, this scenario is a rough approximation of what happens every day, all over the world, in doctors‚Äô offices. The doctors are prescribing chemicals (drugs) whose effects are far more dangerous than germs that may (or may not) be causing patients to be ill.
In other words, a chem-war attack is being leveled at people all over the world all the time.
See Dr. Barbara Starfield (Johns Hopkins School of Public Health), July 26, 2000, Journal of the American Medical Association, ‚ÄúIs US health really the best in the world?‚Äù 106,000 people in America are killed every year by FDA-approved medical drugs. That‚Äôs a million people per decade (click here for more info).
Also search engine ‚ÄúFDA Why Should You Learn About Adverse Drug Reactions.‚Äùthe FDA admits 100,000 people in America die every year from the effects of medical drugs. (Click here to go directly to the FDA page in question.)
In the wake of a staged ‚Äúbiowar‚Äù terror attack, new laws are enacted. The State clamps down harder on basic freedoms. The right to travel is curtailed. Criticizing the authorities is viewed as highly illegal. Freedom of assembly is limited.
‚ÄúCitizens must cooperate. We‚Äôre all in this together.‚Äù
A new federal law mandating the CDC schedule of vaccines for every child and adult‚Äîno exceptions permitted‚Äîis rushed through the Congress and signed by the President.
It‚Äôs all based on a lie‚Ä¶in the same way that the disease theory of the medical cartel is based on a lie: the strength of an individual‚Äôs immune system is the basic determinant of health or illness, not germs considered in a vacuum.
There are people who are determined to inflate the dangers of germs. They trumpet every ‚Äúnew‚Äù germ as the end of humankind on the planet. They especially sound the alarm when researchers claim a germ may have mutated or jumped from animals to humans.
‚ÄúThis is it! We‚Äôre done for!‚Äù
However, if you check into actual confirmed cases of death from recent so-called epidemics, such as West Nile, SARS, bird flu (H5N1), Swine Flu (H1N1), and now MERS, the numbers of deaths are incredibly low, contrasted with, say, the global deaths from ordinary seasonal flu‚Äîwhich is never called a pandemic.
And even seasonal flu, in America, produces far fewer deaths than advertised. As I‚Äôve written before, the CDC keeps one category of statistics for pneumonia and flu combined. When you break out the numbers for each illness, flu death is minuscule.
If political criminals, behind the scenes, wanted to stage a confined ‚Äúbiowar‚Äù event, they would choose a chemical, not a germ, and they would leverage such an event to curtail freedom.
Understand: researchers behind sealed doors in labs can claim, with unassailable ease, that they‚Äôve found a germ that causes an outbreak. Almost no one challenges such an assertion.
This was the case, for example, with the vaunted SARS epidemic (a dud), in 2003, when 10 World Health Organization (WHO) labs, walled off from view, in communication with each other via closed circuit, announced they‚Äôd isolated a coronavirus as the culprit.
Later, in Canada, a WHO microbiologist, Frank Plummer, wandered off the reservation and told reporters he was puzzled by the fact that fewer and fewer SARS patients ‚Äúhad the coronavirus.‚Äù This was tantamount to confessing that the whole research effort had been a failure and a sham‚Äîbut after a day or so of coverage, the press fell silent.
SARS was a nonsensical farce. Diagnosed patients had ordinary seasonal flu or a collection of familiar symptoms that could result from many different causes.
But the propaganda effort was a stunning success. Populations were frightened. The need for vaccines, in the public mind, was exacerbated.
Several years ago, I spoke with a biologist about the fake bioterror scenario I‚Äôve sketched out above. His comment was:
‚ÄúDo you think any mainstream scientist would dare go into that cordoned-off town and actually check the area for a highly toxic chemical? He‚Äôd be blackballed, exiled, and discredited in a minute. The authorities would call him crazy. And that‚Äôs if he were lucky.‚Äù
Such is ‚Äúscience,‚Äù these days. A researcher can discover anything he wants to, if it‚Äôs approved. Otherwise, the door is closed.
After 30 years of covering and reporting on deep science fraud, I can tell you that most scientists know, without instructions from above, the dimensions of their ‚Äúpermitted territory.‚Äù They can sniff out career danger from a mile away.
GMOs? Roundup? Other toxic pesticides? Climate change? Vaccines? Medical drugs? Diagnostic medical tests? Actual environmental pollution? Mercury? Chemicals in food? Radiation? Nuclear power plants? Fracking? Fluorides? On these and a whole host of other issues, government is centrally involved as a ruling force. And there are armies of compliant scientists ready and willing to carry out preferred government (and corporate) dictates. These scientists already know the answers before the questions are even asked.
Meanwhile, propaganda rivers flow, extolling the glories of science.
It‚Äôs a dream situation, for the terminally corrupt.
A huge number of scientists, who don‚Äôt actually participate in research fraud, stand back and watch it happen and say nothing. They see the handwriting on the wall in very large letters.
In 1988, while writing my first book, AIDS INC., I interviewed a highly respected virologist at a US university. I mentioned that several molecular biologists were challenging the HIV-causation hypothesis of AIDS. He told me that he and a number of his colleagues were aware that ‚Äúa serious problem‚Äù existed concerning evidence for the hypothesis, but they were all going to ‚Äúlet this one go.‚Äù It was too political, he said.
Yes, well, an enormous amount of science turns out to be political.
Keeping one‚Äôs head down and letting things go by may not be part of a PhD curriculum, but soon after school is out, researchers enter a different kind of training.
A main theme then pops up: do you want a career, or do you want to live in the middle of nowhere, in exile?
As it so happens, building a broad scientific consensus resting on sand is a straightforward job. It takes time and money, but the work requires no brilliance.
You just flash signs at scientists. The signs say: money; job security; status; advancement; promotion; grants; prestige; reputation; pension; exposure; censure; discrediting; exile; isolation.
They get the idea right away.

"Florida residents on edge as deadly MERS resurfaces, several forced quarantined,...","MERS reemerges Tuesday, this time at least 80 have made contact
ORLANDO, Fl. (INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî Two hospital workers, who were not wearing masks, were exposed to the highly deadly virus MERS¬†recently after the patient passed through two hospitals, including Dr. Phillips Hospital.
At least one of the workers has been put into isolation and is being monitored closely as MERS has a rather long 5-day incubation period.
Other reports state that a second worker was also exposed to the infected patient as well and is being now isolated inside his residence by authorities.
Fox News reported:
Hospital officials said the MERS patient, who works in a hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, is doing well and currently has a low-grade fever and a slight cough.
MERS, which causes coughing, fever and sometimes fatal pneumonia, is a virus from the same family as SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed around 800 people worldwide after it first appeared in China in 2002.
At least 20 medical workers from 2 facilities are undergoing tests for infection and more quarantines are expected.
To make matters worse, ABC News reported:
An estimated 80 other people who may have been exposed to the virus in waiting rooms at the two hospitals have also been contacted. The infected man was not wearing a mask despite his respiratory symptoms and a fever as high as 102 degrees, and did not inform hospital staff that he worked at a hospital in Saudi Arabia that treated MERS patients until after his arrival, officials said.
Dr. P. Phillips Hospital is a 237-bed full-service medical facility in Southwest Orange County, according to the hospital‚Äôs website. Just last year, its staff ran a safety exercise that involved a fictitious MERS case, according to Crespo, who called the exercise an ‚Äúexcellent drill.‚Äù
However, with a 5-day incubation period a pandemic outbreak is not out of the question.
‚ÄúOn May 2, 2014, the first U.S. case of MERS was confirmed in a traveler from Saudi Arabia to the U.S. The traveler is considered to be fully recovered and has been released from the hospital. Public health officials have contacted healthcare workers, family members, and travelers who had close contact with the patient. At this time, none of these contacts has had evidence of being infected with MERS-CoV.‚Äù, reported the Center for Disease Control.
Health officials say that early symptoms of the MERS include a cough, fever and chills diarrhea.
Emergency rooms are expected to be flooded in the coming weeks, either by false alarms or real cases.
The CDC has also posted MERS alerts at 21 airports across the country, as reported by CNN earlier Tuesday.
White House spokesperson Jay Carney even commented on the issue in a press conference Tuesday.¬†‚ÄúThe President has been briefed on this development. The CDC is taking the current situation very seriously‚Äù, stated Carney in the press conference.
However, despite the President‚Äôs concern, local‚Äôs are now questioning where the Florida Dept. of Health has been during all of this as the State of Florida‚Äôs¬†Fatality Management Response Plan¬†clearly points out that the Florida Dept. of Health is supposed to take lead on such matters. So far the Dept. of Health has only released a confirmation dated May 12, 2014, documenting only one MERS case.
Moreover, others are asking the U.S. Secretary of the Dept. of Health and Human Services to ‚Äútake action‚Äù. As MERS may be a severe threat to our nation.
‚ÄúThis could spread all over the United States and could literally kill millions of people‚Äù, said Charles Walton who was commentating on the matter. Walton, went on to talk about the dangers of letting Middle Easterners into our country, as MERS is derived from the Middle East.
The World Health Organization has called for an emergency meeting Tuesday, claiming the general public has nothing to worry about.
The Chicago Tribune reported, ‚ÄúThe WHO said its meeting with health and infectious disease experts was continuing later than planned, and that its conclusions would be announced at a press conference on Wednesday. The last time the agency set up an emergency committee was in response to the 2009 H1N1 ‚Äúswine flu‚Äù pandemic.‚Äù
MERS carries a 30% kill rate, meaning 1 of 3 people who contract the virus will die.
Update 12:50 am, May 14, 2014,¬†via Yahoo News:
‚ÄúTwo of the 20 team members exposed to the confirmed MERS patient are showing symptoms,‚Äù said Geo Morales, spokesman for the Orlando hospital where one infected patient was treated.
‚ÄúOne of the two has been admitted to the hospital but is in stable condition. The other was treated and discharged and is following precautions at home. All 20 team members have been tested and we are expecting those results within the next day or two,‚Äù the spokesman added.",2014-05-13T18:01:45+00:00,https://www.intellihub.com/florida-residents-on-edge-as-deadly-mers-resurfaces-several-forced-quarantined-at-least-80-made-contact/
FL: Second case of deadly MERS virus arrives in U.S. ‚Äî...,"Will the deadly MERS virus sweep America? New fears of pandemic arise
ORLANDO (INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî A deadly¬†virus known as MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) has made its second appearance on U.S. soil lately, this time in Florida, raising major red flags within the health community.
According to reports, a healthcare worker traveling from the Middle East to Florida contracted the virus and has been isolated. So far no others have been reported to be infected.

The deadly MERS virus is said to have a 30% mortality rate, which means that out of every three people who contract the virus, one will die.
As of yet the Center for Disease Control in Miami has been rather silent on the issue publicly. Moreover¬†news reports are trying to calm the public, saying that the virus ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt spread as easily as the common cold or flu‚Äù, however some worry that this will become a big issue.
According to the CDC:
On May 2, 2014, the first U.S. case of MERS was confirmed in a traveler from Saudi Arabia to the U.S. CDC and other public health partners continue to investigate and respond to the situation to prevent the spread of MERS-CoV in the U.S. At this time, no additional MERS cases have been identified in association with this case or otherwise in the U.S. The first U.S. case of MERS represents a very low risk to the general public in this country.
CDC continues to closely monitor the MERS situation globally and work with partners to better understand the risks of this virus, including the source, how it spreads, and how infections might be prevented. CDC recognizes the potential for MERS-CoV to spread further and cause more cases globally and in the U.S. We have provided information for travelers and are working with health departments, hospitals, and other partners to prepare for this.
Interestingly, an excerpt from an article titled¬†Second U.S. case of deadly MERS virus found in Florida, published by¬†USA Today¬†reads:
MERS belongs to the coronavirus family that includes the common cold and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, which caused more than 800 deaths globally in 2003.
Overall the CDC says about 400 people have been identified as coming down with the MERS virus, though there are differing reports about whether all those cases have been confirmed as MERS. More than 100 have died.
More cases are expected to hit the U.S. as some even fear that a full-blown outbreak, quarantines and even pandemic martial law may occur in some regions if the spread of the virus worsens.

*Alert* CDC confirms deadly MRES virus now on U.S. soil,"The¬†Centers for Disease Control and Prevention¬†has confirmed the first case of the deadly¬†MERS¬†virus in the United States.
AZFamily¬†reports:
Middle East respiratory syndrome ‚Äî or MERS ‚Äî first surfaced two years ago. Since then, at least 400 cases of the respiratory illness have been reported, and more than 100 people have died.
Saudi Arabia was been the center of the outbreak. All the victims have had ties to the Middle East or to someone who traveled there.
The virus has been found in camels, but officials don‚Äôt know how it is spreading to humans.
The CDC¬†said¬†the infected person is a healthcare worker who traveled from Saudi Arabia to Indiana:
On April 24, the patient traveled by plane from Saudi Arabia to London, then from London to Chicago,‚Äù the CDC said. ‚ÄúThe patient then took a bus from Chicago to Indiana. On the 27th, the patient began to experience signs of illness, including shortness of breath and coughing. The patient went to an emergency department on April 28th. Because of the patient‚Äôs symptoms and travel history, Indiana public health officials had him tested for MERS.
MERS¬†is related to¬†SARS, the virus that killed nearly 800 people in 2003. Both are caused by¬†coronaviruses, members of a family of viruses that usually cause common cold symptoms and that infect a wide range of mammals.
The virus can survive on surfaces, and kills approximately one-third of people who show symptoms. Some people have been found to have the virus, but never develop symptoms or become ill.
Here are the¬†symptoms:
Coughing
Mucous
Shortness of breath
Malaise ‚Äì a general feeling of being unwell
Chest pain
Fever
Diarrhea¬†(in some cases)
Renal (kidney) failure
The person who brought the virus to the US traveled via airplane and bus.
It is too soon to know if the virus will spread and how many will be impacted, but just in case‚Ä¶are you prepared?
Tess Pennington of Ready Nutrition provides¬†the following tips:
So what can you do to be ready for a pandemic outbreak?
Store a two-week supply of water and food. During a pandemic, if you cannot get to a store, or if stores are out of supplies, it will be important for you to have extra supplies on hand.
Have a supply of face masks to wear around those who may be ill or exposed to the illness.
Periodically check your regular prescription drugs to ensure a continuous supply in your home.
Have any nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins.
Talk with family members and loved ones about how they would be cared for if they got sick, or what will be needed to care for them in your home.
Prepare a¬†sick room¬†for the home to limit family member‚Äôs exposure to the virus.
To decrease the chances of the virus spreading and infecting other household members as well as members of your community, it is important that every effort be made to limit exposure to the illness.¬†¬†Some considerations on how to prevent exposure to a pandemic outbreak are:
Avoid close contact with those who are ill.
Stay inside and avoid contact with others.
Avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes during any pandemic.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve when coughing or sneezing. It may prevent those around you from getting sick.
Keep your hands clean. Washing your hands often will help protect you from germs. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub or make your own¬†natural hand sanitizer.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
If you are ill, stay indoors or keep your distance from others.
Keeping your immune systems up by getting lots of sleep, having a good diet and taking antioxidants in protecting your health.
Remember, MERS is a virus and has no cure. Preventing the spread of the disease is crucial.

"Townsfolk claim all children are missing from town, military presence","PIKE COUNTY (INTELLIHUB) ‚Äî Several residents in the small Missouri town of Aberdeen came forth in a YouTube vlog on Monday in which they expressed their concern over the fact that no children have been seen in their town of about 5,000 in recent days and documented a military presence.
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still no children,‚Äù one of the women in the video said. ‚Äú‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs not being announced for whatever reason.‚Äù
The two women can be seen in the video driving around town to various subdivisions where children are usually present and see nothing. The streets are bare despite the fact that residents have not been ordered to stay inside.
One of the women said that there has been a confirmed case of COVID-19 in the nearby town of Amory in which a woman suddenly collapsed inside a grocery store after coming in contact with someone who took a cruise to Italy.
We have seen two children and we have been driving around all morning,‚Äù the driver said. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the rest of the kids?‚Äù
‚ÄúSchools are closed. daycares are closed, people are out and about,‚Äù the passenger explained. ‚ÄúWhere are the rest of the kids?‚Äù
‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt tell me that they are all staying in the house. These are good ole boys here ‚Äî these are people that aren‚Äôt scared of sh*t.‚Äù
‚ÄúThis town is poor ‚Äî not everyone has Internet and T.V. to even be updated to what‚Äôs going on in the world.‚Äù the driver explained. ‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt be aware of it because they‚Äôre not announcing it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe checkout lady [at the grocery store] said everyone is missing and no one is talking about it [they are] just acting like it‚Äôs normal,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs strange to me ‚Äî now the checkout lady is talking about it.‚Äù
Additionally, the woman said that the Head Start bus was even looking for kids that they were supposed to be picking up.
‚ÄúWe are going down random roads and we are not seeing any children down any of these roads so where are they? She questioned. ‚ÄúWe are not trying to sound paranoid but this is just too odd‚Ä¶ no children‚Ä¶ none.‚Äù
Moreover, the women discovered more af a National Guard presence in town and newly imported heavily armored equipment.",2020-03-18T10:55:36+00:00,https://www.intellihub.com/townsfolk-claim-all-children-are-missing-from-town-military-presence/
