CNBC: J&J Scientific Officer ‘Pretty Confident’ They can Create Coronavirus Vaccine as Outbreak Widens,"The coronavirus has quickly become the focus of worldwide attention. The virus is said to cause flu-like symptoms, and most likely spread into the human population from an infected animal at a market in Wuhan, China.
Several countries are reporting coronavirus cases, including the United States, which on Sunday confirmed a fifth case. Officials have confirmed that the virus has been transmitted from person to person. However, it is still unclear how easy it is to contract it from another individual.
CNBC reports that on Monday, Johnson & Johnson’s chief scientific officer, Dr. Paul Stoffels, expressed his optimism that the drug maker could create a vaccine in the coming months to fight against the fast-spreading coronavirus.

Stoffel said it could take up to a year to bring it to market, but there is hope that the company could shave two to three months off of that due to technological advances, adding:
“We have dozens of scientists working on this so we’re pretty confident we can get something made that will work and stay active for the longer term. We’ll see in the next few weeks how this goes.”
Stoffels confirmed the company started working on a coronavirus vaccine two weeks ago. Chinese officials said there are now more than 2,800 confirmed cases of the flu-like coronavirus, with the death toll rising to 81. According to the World Health Organization, the new strain comes from a large family of viruses known as coronaviruses.

They are known to cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. On Sunday, authorities temporarily banned the trade of wild animals in China. Several companies, including Walt Disney’s Shanghai Disney, are suspending operations until further notice, to prevent the outbreak from spreading. This is especially unusual, as this comes during the ordinarily festive week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Starbucks and McDonald’s also closed stores in Hubei province.
Accordong to Stoffel, this vaccine required the pharmaceutical company to start from scratch. As for the road ahead, he said:
“We are going to take an approach with at least five different constructs and different partners and collaborations all over the world in order to see which part of the virus we can use to make an effective vaccine and develop a model that we can invest in.”
In response to the uproar surrounding the virus, Stoffels commented that the speed at which it is spreading is “scary,” but doesn’t constitute panic. He said:
“But at the same time, I’m very worried that this could become a global pandemic. That’s why we started working on this vaccine two weeks ago, we have to be prepared that this is going to become a global crisis.”

A Miami Man Who Flew to China Worried He Might Have Coronavirus. He May Owe Thousands.,"Last month, Miami resident Osmel Martinez Azcue returned from a work trip in China with flu-like symptoms. Being cautious, he went to the hospital to make sure he didn’t have the coronavirus.
The tests concluded that Azcue had the flu, not the coronavirus. Two weeks after his test, he received a claim for $3,270. With limited insurance coverage, he will be responsible for about $1,400 of that bill. Azcue told the Miami Herald:
“How can they expect normal citizens to contribute to eliminating the potential risk of person-to-person spread if hospitals are waiting to charge us $3,270 for a simple blood test and a nasal swab?”
Hospital officials at Jackson Memorial Hospital, where Azcue was seen, told the Miami Herald that in addition to the bill, he would also have to provide three years of medical records to prove the flu he got didn’t relate to a preexisting condition.

Georgetown University professor and codirector of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms, Sabrina Corlette, told the Herald:
“That’s the critical difference between [Affordable Care Act] plans and junk plans. [Junk plans] will not cover pre-existing conditions.”
Azcue said he earns approximately $55,000 a year working for a medical-device company that does not offer health insurance. He said he was covered under an Affordable Care Act-compliant plan last year that cost him about $278 in monthly premiums, but that shot up to $400 a month when his annual salary kicked in. He canceled his plan in November and now pays $180 per month for a limited plan from National General Insurance.

Corlette said Azcue’s case was a cautionary tale of deregulation in the insurance market, adding:
“When someone has flu-like symptoms, you want them to seek medical care. If they have one of these junk plans and they know they might be on the hook for more than they can afford to seek that care, a lot of them just won’t, and that is a public health concern.”
In 2018, “junk plans” were allowed in the market. Some consumers wrongly think plans with lower monthly costs will be better than no insurance at all, but often the plans aren’t much different from going without insurance altogether, the Herald reported.
When Azcue decided to go to a hospital for screening, instead of to a pharmacy for over-the-counter flu medicine, he felt it was the responsible choice. Nonetheless, he was concerned about how much the visit would cost him.

When staff members told him he’d need a CT scan to screen for the coronavirus, Azcue asked for a flu test first. Azcue told the Herald he said at the hospital:
“This will be out of my pocket. Let’s start with the blood test, and if I test positive, just discharge me.”
Jackson Health officials told the Herald that there were even more bills for Azcue on the way, and it is not clear what the final total will be.

ABC: Feds Backtrack on Transfer of Quarantined Coronavirus Patients to Alabama,"Plans to move American coronavirus patients to the FEMA Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama were canceled Sunday after local officials and residents expressed concerns.
The federal government assured the Calhoun County Emergency Management Agency that the coronavirus patients would be isolated in the Anniston FEMA facility and that they would pose no threat to residents.
Nevertheless, on Sunday, the City Council in Anniston County voted to seek legal action against the federal government over its plan to transfer patients from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to the town’s facility for quarantine. Just hours later, U.S. Sen. Richard Shelby and Gov. Kay Ivey announced on Twitter that plans had changed.

Ivey stated President Trump called her and assured her that the patients who were aboard the Diamond Princess would not be coming to Alabama. Ivy tweeted:
“I thanked him for his support of AL! We always want to help our fellow Americans, but this wasn’t fully vetted.”
The Diamond Princess docked at the Japanese port of Yokohama on Feb. 3 and was placed under quarantine after passengers and crew showed coronavirus symptoms.
As of Sunday, there were 634 confirmed coronavirus cases aboard Diamond Princess, with two deaths. The U.S. government evacuated 300 American passengers to the U.S. last week, 14 of whom tested positive for the virus.

According ot Ivy, the Anniston facility was being considered as a “back up” location in case patients couldn’t be moved to other quarantine locations.
During their council meeting, some councilmembers had mixed feelings about the situation. Councilmember Jay Jenkins agreed that the town should receive more information from the federal government about the transfer, but reiterated that the patients are helpless Americans who need immediate care.

Anniston wasn’t the only American city protesting against plans to house quarantined patients. On Friday, Judge Josephine Staton in Costa Mesa, California issued a temporary restraining order against the federal government to block it from transferring coronavirus patients to a quarantine site in his town.
Just like in Anniston, officials from the Costa Mesa said they were not properly informed about the federal government’s plans.

Francis Boyle Speaks Out About Novel Coronavirus,"2nd CORRECTION: In the first and second publishing of this article we were not clear enough in stating that Francis Boyle’s theory is not supported by evidence and that the scientific evidence actually points to the contrary.
Story at-a-glance –
Francis Boyle, who for decades has advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, suspects COVID-19 is a weaponized pathogen that escaped from Wuhan City’s Biosafety Level 4 facility, which was specifically set up to research coronaviruses and SARS
According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material and possibly flu virus. It also has gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal
The incubation period for COVID-19 infection is still unknown, but estimates range from 14 days to 30 days
The U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015
While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans, should the situation take a turn for the worse
As you know, a novel coronavirus (initially labeled 2019-nCOV before being renamed COVID-19 by the World Health Organization1) originating in Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China, is rapidly spreading across the world.
The first case was reported in Wuhan on December 21, 2019. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, severe cough and pneumonia which, in more severe cases, can lead to impaired kidney and liver function and kidney failure.2,3
On January 21, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case4 — a patient in Washington state who had recently visited Wuhan. Then, the first U.S. death was reported February 29, 2020, in Washington state.5
Less than a week later, CBS News reported March 5, 2020, that the number of deaths had quickly risen to 11 nationwide in the U.S. — 10 in Washington state and one in California.6 Not only that, but as of that day, “The World Health Organization urged governments around the world to pull out ‘all the stops’” to fight the outbreak. On the up side, China “appeared to be over the worst” of it, CBS said.
All told, as of March 5, 2020, there were 98,067 reported cases of novel coronavirus infections affecting 88 countries, 80,430 of which were in China. Worldometer.info provides an easy overview of confirmed cases and deaths that you can check for the latest statistics.7

COVID-19 — A Weaponized Coronavirus?
In this interview, Francis Boyle — whose background includes an undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago, a juris doctor (lawyer) degree from Harvard and a Ph.D. in political science — shares his theory of the origin of this novel coronavirus.
For decades, he’s advocated against the development and use of bioweapons, which he suspects COVID-19 is. In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr.
At the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50,000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup.
As a result of Boyle’s antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration — a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons — Boyle has carefully followed “mysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world” that have appeared since then.
“My biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted. 
Even though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,” Boyle says.
“So, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me. 
There is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It’s the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus. 
There have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons. 
For that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility … maybe mid-November … and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.”

Many Unknowns Remain
The first reported case of COVID-19 infection was December 1, 2019. Depending on the incubation period, which is still unknown, the initial lead, provided there was one, might have occurred anywhere in November. The official estimate is a 14-day incubation period, but a British health expert believes it’s 24 days, and North Korean biological warfare experts believe it’s 30 days, Boyle says.
“As for Wuhan and Hubei Province, they’re basically under martial law. There’s no other word for it. If you read the statements by President Xi and his assistants, they’ve made it very clear they’re at war here, and that is correct. They’re at war with their own biological warfare agent. 
President Xi just fired the party apparatchiks in charge of this and has brought in trusted military personnel to handle it, as well as large numbers of PLA [People’s Liberation Army] forces saying they’re health care workers. They don’t look like health care workers to me. So, as of now, that’s my best reading of the situation.”
When asked about rumors the COVID-19 virus might have been stolen from a high-security laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, Boyle says:
“It could have been. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion they were already working on that at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility. They were working on a biological warfare weapon involving SARS, which is a coronavirus to begin with. 
We do know that Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin … resurrected the Spanish flu virus for the Pentagon, obviously for weapons purposes, and he specializes in mating the Spanish flu virus to all sorts of hideous biowarfare instrumentalities. And there was a record of him shipping his products to Winnipeg. 
Winnipeg is Canada’s equivalent of our own Fort Detrick. It’s a BSL-4 facility, and yes, they research, develop tests, manufacture and stockpile every type of hideous biological warfare weapon that we know of. So, some of this technology could have been stolen from Winnipeg. I don’t know about that but, as I said, the Wuhan BSL-4 was already working on this to begin with. 
They had already developed SARS. SARS had leaked out two to three times before this, and it seems they were turbocharging SARS, which is what [COVID-19] looks to be. This is a brand-new generation of biowarfare weapons we haven’t seen before. 
Its lethality goes from 15%, as estimated by Lancet, up to 17% to 18% by a British health official and even Chinese statistics. Its infectivity is 83%. It can infect maybe three to four people for every person infected. 
It has gain of function properties, which means it travels through air at least 6 or 7 feet, and … there are reports that even contaminated human feces give it off, that the human feces radiate off maybe 6 or 7 feet. So, we’ve never seen anything like this before in the history of biological warfare, at least in the public record.
I want to make it clear: I have never worked for the United States government. I’ve never had a security clearance. I’ve never had access to any type of secret information. 
I just read what is in the public record and the scientific record and try to draw my own conclusions, and that’s what I’m giving you today. I could change my opinion if people can provide me reputable scientific evidence to the contrary.
Right now, I’m standing by my conclusion that it leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4, the highest level of the Chinese government has known about it, they’ve been covering it up from the get-go, until they informed the WHO at the end of December.”

Despite Laws, Biowarfare Experimentation Is Alive and Well
As noted by Boyle, the Wuhan lab is a designated WHO research lab, which may sound odd, considering these facilities specialize in developing and researching dangerous pathogens that can easily be turned into bioweapons.
According to Boyle, we should not be surprised however, as “WHO is up to its eyeballs in this type of work and has been for quite some time.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the drug industry also appear to have had their hand in many of the outbreaks of what appear to be weaponized viruses.
“I won’t go through the long history of big pharma getting involved in this. There’s huge amounts of money here. I believe the West Africa Ebola pandemic originated out of the US BSL-4 facility in Sierra Leone, and [that] they were testing out a so-called vaccine that contained live Ebola and gave it to these poor people,” Boyle says.
“As for the CDC, it has been involved in every … BSL-4 biological warfare death science you could possibly imagine … It’s a matter of public record that during the Reagan administration, the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection sent 40 shipments of weapons-grade biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these agents and use them against Iran …
Of course, the problem is that when that war was over … an order was given to U.S. military forces to blow up Saddam Hussein’s biological warfare facilities, and that’s not how you deal with biological warfare weapons … 
[It] contaminated our own troops, and that was a causative factor in the Gulf War Syndrome that … murdered about 11,000 U.S. troops and disabled about 100,000.”
According to Boyle, the U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015, which is no small sum. To put it into perspective, the U.S. spent $40 billion (assuming a constant dollar value) on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Boyle also estimates the U.S. has some 13,000 life scientists working within the biowarfare industry.
“Clearly, the Reagan administration, under the influence of its neoconservatives who definitely believe in biological weapons and ethnic-specific biological weapons (you can see that in the PNAC report), were engaged in the use of DNA genetic engineering for the purpose of manufacturing biological weapons. 
That is why I gave a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. in 1985. I was asked to do that by the Council for Responsible Genetics that I work with, which involves the leading life scientists in the world from MIT and Harvard. 
I spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees and I knew all these people. They asked me to serve as their lawyer and give this Congressional briefing. I blew the whistle, and then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation, which I did …
I want to make it clear I’m not here to speak in their name, I’m only speaking in my name, but if you look at my book, ‘Biological Warfare and Terrorism,’ professor Jonathan King wrote the foreword. So, I have the leading MIT professor of molecular biology supporting what I’m saying, if you don’t think I know enough science about it.”
US Prepares for COVID-19 Pandemic
While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans,8 should the situation take a turn for the worse.
Historically speaking, however, government health officials have been vastly exaggerating the threat of pandemics in the U.S., including the bird flu, the swine flu, anthrax and Ebola.
For example, as detailed in my 2009 New York Times bestseller “The Great Bird Flu Hoax,” then-President George Bush Jr. projected 2 million Americans would die from bird flu; the best-case scenario taking only 200,000 lives. The final death count in the U.S. from that pandemic was zero.
It generated massive profits, though, as U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to purchase 20 million doses of Tamiflu. One of the people who was able to line his pockets from that hoax was defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was president of Gilead Sciences when the drug was created.
“[The bird flu] was another DNA, genetically engineered biological warfare weapon,” Boyle notes. “It was a chimera. It had three different elements in it and we were all lucky that somehow they attenuated the lethality and the infectiveness of the bird flu.”
Whether or not COVID-19 will be similarly ineffective in its spread and lethality remains to be seen. Judging by the statistics in China, “it doesn’t look very good,” Boyle says.

Understanding the COVID-19 Virus
According to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera, like the avian flu virus before it. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material. “That was in a published article by Indian scientists. You could see the pictures right there, [but] political pressure was brought to bear upon them so they withdrew [the paper].”
This is why some scientists are now looking into using HIV drugs to treat it,9 Boyle says. COVID-19 may also have a flu virus mixed in, along with gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal.
Pandemics Repeatedly Used to Further Police State
Pandemics have also been used to chip away public freedoms. For example, the anthrax scare of 2001 was used as the impetus for signing the Patriot Act, which was the first step in taking away many of our personal freedoms and rolling out a complete surveillance state. To me, such outcomes are far more concerning than the risk of infection itself. Boyle adds:
“They used Amerithrax to ram the Patriot Act through, that is correct … We became a police state … And as I pointed out in ‘Biowarfare and Terrorism,’ I think the same people who were behind the 9/11 terrorist attack were also behind the Amerithrax, but I’m just connecting dots there …
What’s called Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare weapons lab and program, and I publicly blew the whistle on that the first weekend of November 2001. 
The Council for Responsible Genetics was having its convention at Harvard Business School and I was chairing a panel with King and other experts on biological warfare, on U.S. biological warfare programs. 
As I was walking into the Harvard Divinity School, Fox TV had a camera crew there and I said, ‘Obviously, this came out a U.S. biological weapons program and probably Fort Detrick.’ 
I conducted the session and made the same comment. Then I made a comment to a Washington, D.C., radio station to that effect [and to] the BBC, so everyone in the world heard me. 
At that point, someone gave an order that I was never to be interviewed again by any mainstream news about biological warfare programs. And that’s been the case since the first week of November 2001.”
As noted by Boyle, George Orwell’s book, “1984,” has become reality. Boyle has since lectured lawyers at DePaul Law School in Chicago about the totalitarian nature of the Patriot Act.
“Snowden has correctly pointed out the federal government is spying on everything we say, all of our electronic communications, you name it,” Boyle says. 
“And again, the proof is I’ve been completely blackballed out of U.S. media. Indeed, if you go back and look at the Amerithrax attacks, they also hit mainstream U.S. media to make it clear to them that if they covered this issue they will be killed too.”
Bioweapons Are Developed To Be Used
As noted by Boyle, the U.S. government has a large stockpile of Amerithrax — a super weapons-grade nanotechnology anthrax with 1 trillion spores per gram — and that’s just the tip of the iceberg of the biological weapons developed. What’s more, Boyle has no doubt these weapons will eventually be put to use, as they have in the past. He says:
“There was a tabletop exercise at John Hopkins University last fall … on coronavirus.10 Tabletop exercise, that’s a euphemism for a war game. Their estimate was that it killed 65 million people11 …
John Hopkins is up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare dirty work. They have a BSL-3 facility there … that they proudly announce on their website … They justify it by saying they’re developing vaccines. OK … How do they do that? 
They go out around the world, and this is a matter of public record, and scour for every type of hideous disease, fungus, virus and bacteria you can possibly imagine. They then bring it back to these BSL-4 labs and develop an offensive, biological agent using DNA genetic engineering and synthetic biology … set up by the Pentagon under DARPA …
Once they have this offensive agent, they then proceed to develop a vaccine, because the agent is no good unless you can have a vaccine to protect your own people. 
So, they’re developing vaccines to have biological weapons, because a biological weapon consists of two elements: the offensive biological warfare agent in the first place, and then, second, a vaccine to protect your own people, and that is what is being done at all these BSL-4 facilities, and many of the BSL-3s as well. 
John Hopkins has a BSL-3 and they admit they do dual use. That’s what dual use means. They first develop the offensive biological warfare agent and then they develop the supposed vaccine.”
Indeed, Johns Hopkins University is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It has also received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.12 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.13
Novel Coronavirus — The Latest Pandemic Scare
How Can We Best Prevent or Treat COVID-19 Infection?
While it’s unclear exactly which treatment is the most effective, my guess is that Dr. Paul Marik’s intravenous vitamin C protocol for sepsis would be a good starting point, seeing how sepsis appears to be what kills those who succumb to a serious COVID-19 infection.
Marik’s retrospective before-after clinical study14,15 showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and vitamin B1 for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%. The precise protocol used was 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1,500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours.16 Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer.
According to Marik, vitamin C and corticosteroids have a synergistic effect,17 which is part of why his combo protocol is so effective. Still, simply using high-dose IV vitamin C exclusively has been shown to improve survival in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory failure, reducing mortality from 46% to 30%.18
It also reduced the number of days they needed to remain hospitalized. On average, those who received vitamin C had by Day 28 spent three fewer days in the intensive care unit than the placebo group (seven days compared to 10). By Day 60, the treatment group had also spent seven fewer days in the hospital overall —15 days compared to 22.19
While there are no trials that look at integrating hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), my suspicion is that this would provide a powerful synergy that could get the fatality rate from sepsis even closer to zero. Sadly, HBOT is not available at many hospitals, and even if it were, it is not approved for sepsis.
You can learn more about Marik’s sepsis protocol in “Vitamin C — A Game Changer in Treatment of Deadly Sepsis,” along with commonsense recommendations for how to lower your risk of sepsis in the first place.
You can also review Marik’s PowerPoint presentation, “Hydrocortisone, Ascorbic Acid and Thiamine for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,” presented at the 2020 Critical Care Reviews meeting in Australia.

NY Post: North Korean Official Reportedly Executed for Breaking Coronavirus Quarantine,"A North Korean trade official has reportedly been executed by firing squad for going to a public bath, in violation of his 14-day coronavirus quarantine after having returned from China.
According to the New York Post, the trade official had been placed in isolation after traveling to China. The report said the official was arrested and immediately executed for endangering the country’s population.
The execution came on the heels of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s decision to close off its borders to China on January 30 and impose “rule by military law” against anyone who leaves without permission. The report also suggested that another official who tried to conceal his travel history to China has been exiled to work on a country farm.

Although North Korea has maintained that there is not a single coronavirus case within its borders, Kim and his government have employed drastic measures to prevent the coronavirus from entering the country, especially along the 880-mile-long border it shares with China. International traffic has been blocked and any visitors wishing to enter the capital city of Pyongyang will be screened.

Despite the country’s claim that there is not a single coronavirus case in North Korea, Bir Mandal of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization told Korea Biomed, told The Mirror:
“The North Korean authorities have told FAO that there are no cases of the new coronavirus, but we are suspicious of such claims.”
Harry Kazianis, director of Korean studies at the Center for National Interest, told Fox News:
“…there is no way that North Korea is not being impacted by the coronavirus. “They are clearly lying as they don’t want to show any weakness or that there is any threat to the regime. Considering how there are many porous sections of the North Korea-China border — and how the Kim regime depends on illegal trade to survive — it is clear the virus has come to North Korea.”
According to aid workers, North Korea’s dated health care system is ill-equipped to handle the novel virus. Nonetheless, North Korean health ministry official Song In Bom told state media that there are no coronavirus cases in the country, but that they would be prepared in the event that the outbreak spread. He said:
“Just because there is no case of the new coronavirus in our country, we should not be too relieved, but have civil awareness and work together for prevention.”
Harvard Medical School lecturer Kee Park has made many humanitarian trips to the impoverished country. He said it would struggle to manage an outbreak, telling the South China Morning Post:
“Perhaps they can manage to detect and treat small numbers, but an outbreak could likely easily overload the health system. Critical medical supplies are hard to import and vital equipment is unable to be repaired due to the difficulty in procuring parts.”

Nagi Shafik, former project manager for the WHO’s office in Pyongyang, said North Korean authorities would need supplies and antibiotics, adding:
“May I remind as well that many women and children suffer from malnutrition; these are factors that affect the immunity system and render humans more susceptible to infection.”

Neighbors Hold Porch Concert to Entertain Woman Self-Isolating Due to Coronavirus,"Helena Schlam, 78, usually spends her time going to concerts, book club meetings, exercise classes, and lunch with friends. Right now, however, she is trying to be reasonable and is self-isolating in her Clintonville home to avoid the novel coronavirus. 
Rebecca Tien lives across the street from Helena and called to check on her, which made Helena’s day.

Health experts caution that the fear and anxiety over the spread of the virus combined with isolation can lead to feelings of hopelessness and depression. Dr. Joseph Gastaldo, an infectious disease expert at OhioHealth, said:
“We’re all social people. We need social interaction and when we don’t see people face to face and we do it in a more sterile environment, that can lead to depression.”

USA Today: Concerns Over New Virus from China Prompt Rare Airport Screenings for Some Travelers,"Passengers traveling from Wuhan, China, to the United States will undergo entry screening at three U.S. airports for symptoms associated with a new coronavirus that has killed two people in Asia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Friday. 
Screenings for 2019 Novel Coronavirus, or “2019-nCoV,” will occur at New York City’s JFK International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport and San Francisco International Airport. Approximately 100 additional CDC staff will be on hand to assist with the efforts.

Wuhan is the most populated city in central China, with roughly 11 million people. All three U.S. airports where the CDC screenings will take place have direct flights from Wuhan.

 
This is only the second time that the CDC has conducted airport screenings. The first was in 2014, in response to concerns over the Ebola virus, where health officials screened thousands of passengers from three West African countries for Ebola but identified no illnesses.
The CDC, citing Chinese health officials, said most of the patients affected have links to a seafood market, and at least one animal market, where authorities suspect they contracted the disease from an animal. The CDC added that some of the dozens of ill patients in the current 2019-nCoV outbreak might have contracted the disease from other people.

Officials estimated that about 5,000 passengers would go through the additional screening process in the next few weeks. Many countries in Asia have begun screening passengers on flights from central China.
The most common symptoms of the new coronavirus are fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Lab tests ruled out MERS and SARS, as well as several other possible illnesses.
The World Health Organization reported on Thursday there have been two confirmed international cases of 2019-nCoV – one in Thailand and one in Japan, both from people who had traveled to Wuhan. More cases are expected in other countries.
The CDC said the risk from the illness to Americans is minimal and described the screening measures as “proactive preparedness precautions.”

"Updated Every Minute, 17-Year-Old Whiz Kid’s Coronavirus Site Used by Millions","A Seattle teenager has built a website that is keeping the world updated on the COVID-19 pandemic as it spreads. The site has been visited by 12 million people since it launched in late December.
Computer whiz Avi Schiffmann, 17, spends much of his time these days continually updating and improving his website, ncov2019.live, which automatically scrapes data from reliable sources from around the world. The site, which initially updated every ten minutes, now updates every minute to provide the latest statistics on the number of confirmed cases, severe cases, deaths, and recovered. And it does so in real-time both worldwide and in each country. 
FORBES: New York Is Making Its Own Hand Sanitizer Using Inmate Labor to Fight The Coronavirus Outbreak
FORBES: New York Is Making Its Own Hand Sanitizer Using Inmate Labor to Fight The Coronavirus Outbreak
The site also hosts an interactive Google map, a Twitter feed, travel advisories, information on the disease and its prevention, as well as tips for preparing for quarantine situations. Schiffman, a high school junior said:
“I started working on this project at Christmastime, when there were fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases — all in mainland China. It was hard to get clear, concise, and accurate information on what was going on, and I wanted to do something to fix this.”
Schiffmann undertook this project because it allowed him to learn web scraping technology. He said:
“It would also be a way to help with global health, which is something that’s needed when not all governments are the nicest or transparent, and it is hard to get information.”

Schiffmann’s website scrapes information from official government health organizations (local, national, and international), and trustworthy news outlets. He relies on an online community of news curators to help with this. He also coded the website to crosscheck data to make sure it is accurate, explaining:
“It’s all automated, so I don’t have to input anything manually. The web scraper runs even when I’m sleeping.”
Schiffman said he is getting 1,000 messages a day, ranging from PhDs with suggestions to media outlets hoping for an interview. 
Planned improvements to ncov2019.live include regional statistical breakdowns, graphs comparing the COVID-19 outbreak to historical pandemics, a vaccine tracker, and translation of the site to 30 different languages.
The English site has been visited online by every country on earth, with less than half from the United States.  As word has spread, the site has grown exponentially. It took a month to reach the first million, but in just the past 24 hours alone the site was visited by 3.2 million people.

The teenager hopes to become a serial entrepreneur. He plans to take some time off after high school to travel the world to participate in hackathons. Not in it for the money, Schiffman said he wants to be creative and make an impact, proclaiming:
“I want to have the skills to make the next big thing, to change the world. I’m not interested in imitating anyone else. I want to be the next Avi Schiffmann.
I use coding like a painter uses a paintbrush. I like the technical aspect, but it’s a creative medium for me. I like making things and sharing them.” 
Schiffman shared that looking at a computer screen is not all that he enjoys. He also loves traveling and skis competitively.

Even though he’s received many internship and job offers from his coronavirus tracking website, Schiffman’s focus remains on the main objective of his project, which is to help, and not add to the growing panic as the virus spreads. He said:
“I have to admit that it is pretty scary, especially here in Seattle which is the epicenter from which the virus spread in this area. There have been a lot of school closures and cancellations of events. It’s a ghost town around here.”
Schiffmann said he was worried about the spread of misinformation, and blamed the media for causing unnecessary panic, adding:
“People should have preparedness plans and stock up in advance instead of going on panicked Costco runs now.”

FOX: California Lab Says it Discovered Coronavirus Vaccine in 3 Hours,"Inovio, an American biotech company, says it created a coronavirus vaccine three hours after getting access to the virus’ genetic sequence in mid-January. The company received $9 million to work on the vaccine from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which is backed by billionaire Bill Gates.
Inovio Pharmaceuticals is based in Pennsylvania, but scientists in its laboratory in San Diego made the discovery, and are racing to get the vaccine on the market in record time. Dr. J. Joseph Kim, Inovio’s president and CEO, told FOX Business:
“We were able to rapidly construct our vaccine in a matter of about three hours once we had the DNA sequence from the virus available because of the power of our DNA medicine platform. Our goal is to start phase one human testing in the U.S. early this summer.”
“We’ve done this many, many times before. The most relevant was building our vaccine against MERS virus, which is a coronavirus in the same family as COVID-19.”1

Kim indicated Inovio had previously worked on the Zika virus, saying:
“Inovio took a vaccine for Zika virus from construct design to human testing in the U.S. in less than seven months. We’re planning to beat our own record. Maybe we could do that in close to half that time.”1
Inovio is building an alliance for the “war” against COVID-19 that will demand scaling up to thousands upon thousands of doses, Kim said.
Another U.S. company, Maryland-based Novavax, who made an Ebola vaccine in 90 days, is trying to make a coronavirus vaccine in as little as three months. However, such vaccines can take years to develop.

Ibuprofen And COVID-19 Symptoms: Here’s What You Need to Know,"Living under the uncertainty of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has sparked many concerns and questions worldwide. Though it is widely understood that the virus spreads rapidly and the nation is in the midst of a pandemic, people grapple with how to manage the emerging infection. Communities work to restrict the movement of people, and everyone is doing his or her part to social distance. But what to do if you in fact contract the illness? How do you best treat symptoms of COVID-19?
International researchers and healthcare professionals, working to provide us the most up to date information possible, are sharing some new tips in March 2020 to manage COVID-19 infections.
Ibuprofen: Can I Use It Or Not?
A recent concern prompted by a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) over the use of ibuprofen during coronavirus infections has been rectified. As of March 18, 2020, WHO and other health groups around the globe okay the use of ibuprofen in the management of COVID-19 symptoms. Beyond the drug’s usual side effects, there are no known additional negative outcomes from managing COVID-19 symptoms with this common over-the-counter medication (also referred to as Motrin or Advil).
The classification of ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or for short, NSAIDs. NSAIDs are not ideal drugs for everyone and are, therefore, not recommended for everyone. Specifically, NSAIDs should not be taken by those with diminished circulation, heart disease, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.
As effective as Ibuprofen, is it in your pantry?
As effective as Ibuprofen, is it in your pantry?
What Does The Research Say?
There has been past research indicating that some respiratory infections and diseases (ie. asthma) can worsen symptoms and cause greater complications when treated with ibuprofen. An explanation as to why this happens is not clear. But some experts believe ibuprofen ‘dampens’ the body’s immune response. However, it must be noted that no such evidence exists for COVID-19.
Professor Parastou Donyai at the University of Reading reinforced this sentiment when speaking to BBC on March 17, 2020. She said, “I have not seen any scientific evidence that clearly shows a totally healthy 25-year-old taking ibuprofen for symptoms of COVID-19 is putting themselves at additional risk of complications.”

What About Acetaminophen?
Both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are well-known medications to treat fevers, diminish body aches, and manage other flu-like symptoms. As an NSAID, patients with multiple health conditions or the elderly are being urged by some doctors to be assessed for ibuprofen use on a case-by-case basis during the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, acetaminophen (not an NSAID) remains a safe choice for nearly everyone impacted by infection. Acetaminophen (ie.Tylenol), tends to be an especially great supplement to other cold and flu medications. A maximum dose of acetaminophen in 24 hours is 3,000 milligrams for adults.
If I Get Coronavirus, What About My Other Regular Medications?
Like ibuprofen, some misinformation has been circulating online regarding heart and asthma medications. Of particular concerns, heart medications classified as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are thought to worsen COVID-19 symptoms. ACE and ARB medications are often prescribed daily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), improve heart function, and in some cases, prompt kidney function.
As of March 24, 2020, the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) strongly recommend that people taking these medications should continue to do so, even if they become infected with the coronavirus. There is little human research to show that ACE and ARBs medications actually worsen lung function during respiratory infections. As well, stopping your ACE or ARBs places you at greater risk of complications. In the case of an infection, untreated hypertension and decreased heart function can strain your cardiovascular system.
As of now, nobody taking regular medication – especially for heart or lung disease – is recommended to stop these treatments. If you have concerns, speak to a trusted healthcare provider.

In Case of Infection, Rely on Reputable Sources
Ultimately, not much is known and new information is emerging daily about coronavirus. During this time, ensure you are seeking information about the management of COVID-19 from reputable sources. Turning to the WHO for regular updates is a particularly great strategy. Do not seek health information from social media outlets like a Facebook post or WhatsApp message. Seemingly casual speculation can likewise perpetuate rumors and false knowledge.
If you develop signs of COVID-19 rely on your local health authority. Common signs of coronavirus include fever, sore throat, cough, aches, congestion, a tight chest, and shortness of breath. It is important that we follow information coming from health experts, governments, and researchers in the coming days.

"According to local officials, FEMA Facility Will No Longer Be Used as Coronavirus Quarantine Center","Editor’s note: Update. Since we reported on the national news story that coronavirus patients would be housed at a FEMA camp in the state of Alabama, local elected officials have announced this will, in fact, not happen after all. 
 Locals (along with politicians) stated they didn’t want these infected people housed at FEMA camps in their states. Alabama Senator Shelby, Governor Kay Ivey and Congressman Mike Rogers (AL-03) have all  tweeted that they have respectively spoken with the president over the phone on Sunday afternoon. In those phone calls, Trump reportedly affirmed that the patients will not be coming to Alabama.
 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced on Saturday that American passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan would be quarantined at the FEMA Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama.
Passengers who will stay at the Alabama federal facility have tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) but are not currently showing symptoms. If they become seriously ill, they will be taken to pre-vetted hospitals for medical care. The patients are expected to be transported to the facility this week.

Novel Coronavirus — The Latest Pandemic Scare
Read the entire HHS statement below:
HHS is taking precautions to protect the health of all Americans from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To that end, HHS and FEMA agreed to use a federal facility, the FEMA Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama, as a place for some of the American passengers from the Diamond Princess to stay. These are passengers whom the federal government evacuated back to the U.S. from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.
The passengers who will stay at the Center tested positive for COVID-19, although at this time they either do not have symptoms or have mild flu-like symptoms. Any of the evacuees who become seriously ill will be transported to pre-identified hospitals for medical care. Under the HHS-FEMA agreement, the Center for Domestic Preparedness will provide the housing, and HHS will provide basic medical care and all other support services for these returning passengers. Passengers will stay in a separate area from the Center’s training participants and will remain at the Center until they are medically cleared.1
The Center has unique facilities and routinely offers week-long, hands-on training for large groups of professionals from federal, state and local emergency management agencies, hospitals, public health agencies, and law enforcement agencies on disaster response.
FEMA’s Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) in Anniston is one of the country’s most advanced training sites for health and medical education in disasters. The facility trains first responders from around the country year-round.
At a news conference Saturday, Anniston Mayor Jack Draper said that city and county leaders were taken entirely by surprise at the news on Saturday and that the decision was the federal government’s. He indicated they were not asked for permission.

Mayor Draper said they were assured by the federal government that the community would not have any impact whatsoever from the patients being held at the facility. He is, however, “concerned” they weren’t made aware of the plan earlier.
Draper also stressed that the patients would be kept entirely separate from the people training at the facility and that the patients would not be allowed to leave the facility until they’re medically cleared to do so.
At the same news conference, Calhoun County Commission Chairman Tim Hodges said that he intends to look at legal steps that could be taken to block the patients from being brought to the facility.

"This New Neighborhood Will Grow Its Own Food, Power Itself, And Handle Its Own Waste","The village will be located on the outskirts of Almere, a quickly growing town 20 minutes by train from Amsterdam, and will grow about half of the food they eat— excluding coffee or bananas, for instance (although the company believes in some locations, the neighborhood could actually be fully self-sufficient). The community will also feed energy back to the local grid.  While they plan to expand everywhere, they currently have planned projects in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Germany. They would even like to adapt the system for arid climates such as the Middle East.
From the Fast Coexist article:
“By using the most advanced methods for growing food—a combination of aeroponics, aquaponics, permaculture, food forests, and high-yield organic farming—the neighborhood will grow many times more food than a traditional farm of the same size, with fewer resources. Aquaponics, for example, can produce 10 times as much produce on the same amount of land, with 90% less water.
Any household waste that can be composted will feed livestock or soldier flies. The soldier flies will feed fish, and fish waste will fertilize an aquaculture system that produces fruit and vegetables for the homes. Seasonal gardens will be fertilized by waste from the livestock.”
James Ehrlich, CEO of RenGen Villages, anticipates tons of “abundant, organic food” (vegetables, fruit, nuts, legumes, fish, eggs, chicken, small animal dairy and protein) every year from the community. In fact, in order to supplement their seasonal gardens they will use vertical garden systems all year long. The Danish architecture firm, Effekt, helped them on the design.
They will produce their own energy by using a mixture of geothermal, solar, solar thermal, wind, and biomass. Ehrlich says they are even looking at certain technologies for small-footprint biomass that use farm waste and turn it into a consistent energy source- even in the dead of winter. A smart grid will distribute power efficiently throughout the community, sending it to a carport to charge shared electric cars as needed.
There is a biogas plant planned that will turn any non-compostable household waste into power and water and their water storage system will collect rainwater and graywater to redistribute it to seasonal gardens and the aquaponic system.
Ehrlich says, “We’re really looking at a global scale. We are redefining residential real-estate development by creating these regenerative neighborhoods, looking at first these greenfield pieces of farmland where we can produce more organic food, more clean water, more clean energy, and mitigate more waste than if we just left that land to grow organic food or do permaculture there,” reports Fast Coexist.
The community in Almere will break ground this summer and is slated to be finished in 2017! This is exciting. I would LOVE to have one of these communities show up here in the states.
What about you? Would you live in a community like this?

Oregon Gov. Kate Brown Orders All Schools to Close Until April to Slow Coronavirus,"Turning to a “last resort” she hoped to avoid, Oregon Gov. Kate Brown Thursday night ordered all schools closed for at least two weeks to help stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. The move will affect 583,000 students. 
The stunning order will close schools from Monday, March 16, until Tuesday, March 31. Brown said in announcing her decision that students would return to class on Wednesday, April 1. She said in her statement:
“I have heard from superintendents, school board members, teachers, parents, and students that it has now become impossible to functionally operate schools due to workforce issues and student absences.”

The development will disrupt life not only at schools but in homes and businesses across Oregon as thousands of parents face the prospect of children at home. The closure will be especially challenging for low-income or homeless families whose children count on free meals from school. The governor, who said she was left with little choice, remarked:
“So many of our families depend on school in order for parents to go to their jobs, and for students to access health care and receive nutrition.”
“I want to be very clear. Sending Oregon children home will not stop the spread of the coronavirus.”

Oregon is not the only state to issue statewide closures. Michigan, Ohio and Maryland have done the same, and another 21 states have closed some schools as federal and state officials deal with what has now been termed a global pandemic.
John Larson, president of the Oregon Education Association, said in a statement:
“It is critical that our students who rely on our public schools for their only reliable nutritious meal in a day continue to receive access to those meals. It is essential the governor’s office release guidance instructing school districts to keep public school employees financially whole during the closing of schools. Oregon’s students and educators should not have to bear the burden of a public health outbreak that is far beyond their control.”
Brown acted just hours after a news conference where she announced state restrictions against gatherings of 250 people or more. She said then that it was “critically important” for schools to remain open and said she was heeding the advice of public health experts in deciding to leave schools open. State officials, however, did advise schools to cancel most group activities, including parent-teacher conferences, field trips, and school programs. Those restrictions still apply to school systems remaining open.

Brown anticipated the need to close Oregon schools in a letter Wednesday to Vice President Mike Pence that sought federal help on several fronts with money and supplies. Among her requests was a relaxation of federal rules governing meals provided in schools heavily populated by low-income students. She also asked permission for closed schools to distribute food supplies to local food banks, adding:
“This is an important tool to ensure that low-income students and their families who qualified for free or reduced price meals do not go hungry when schools close.”
In her announcement Thursday night, Brown said that “districts are tasked with developing plans to continue nutrition services during the closure.” Brown also asked for federal help for child care providers “to prevent the collapse of the overall child care business, further depleting the supply of affordable child care in the state.”
While young children and teenagers are among the least vulnerable to the virus — the majority of fatalities have been recorded in people older than 60 — public health experts have said preventing crowds from gathering is one of the most effective ways to slow the spread of the disease and keep hospitals and health care workers from becoming overwhelmed by serious cases.

"BREAKING: Harvard, Vanderbilt, and Other Universities Cancel In-Person Classes; Students Must Move Out By Sunday","Universities from California to New York have closed campus classrooms as the novel coronavirus has affected more than 100,000 people across the globe and its spread has officially transformed into a pandemic.
Vanderbilt University, along with Harvard and a growing list of other universities, has canceled all in-person classes for the rest of the semester. All undergraduate Vandy students living on campus must move out by Sunday.
At some universities, online instruction is being offered for a limited period, or through the semester. Depending on the laws in their state, some schools are telling students to not return to campus for 14 days after their return.
Vanderbilt’s closing comes after a Vanderbilt University Medical Center employee tested positive for COVID-19. Online classes and alternative learning courses will launch Monday for all students. An email was sent out to students and staff from Interim Chancellor Susan Wente.
Read the full statement from Wente below:
Dear Vanderbilt community,
Today, we received notice from Vanderbilt University Medical Center that a VUMC health care worker has tested positive for COVID-19. Out of an abundance of caution and based on public health recommendations and best practices, we will move fully to online and alternative learning for the remainder of the semester.
Given that, all undergraduate residential students should make plans to move out by March 15. We are actively working on plans to assist undergraduate residential students with move out and are evaluating an approach to address on-campus housing and dining fees for the remaining month of classes. We will send details about those plans to the students and families. Students who need to remain on campus beyond this date will receive further information.
Classes remain cancelled for the remainder of this week. Online and alternative learning will launch Monday, March 16, for undergraduate, graduate and professional students. Faculty and graduate assistants should coordinate directly with their deans and department chairs, and staff with their managers, with questions.
Be assured that our campus remains safe and open. We are continuing our cleaning, sanitizing, social distancing and other best practices to keep our campus safe.
I know this news will raise many questions specific to your situation. We are now preparing detailed information, guidance and resources for all students, faculty, staff and postdoctoral scholars. We will share that information as soon as it is available.
This is not how any of us wanted this semester to proceed, but we are acting now to ensure the health and safety of all members of our community. While our campus is the heart of this university, our people are its soul. This challenging situation is necessitating a temporary change to how we deliver education, but it will not deter us from the pursuit of our mission.
I remind you that all of the rest of our policies and guidelines remain in place. Please closely monitor the university’s COVID-19 website—all updates, policies and a detailed FAQ will continue to be posted to that site. Contact [email protected] with questions.
With much appreciation,

FORBES: New York Is Making Its Own Hand Sanitizer Using Inmate Labor to Fight The Coronavirus Outbreak,"New York state governor Andrew Cuomo announced today that the state is making its own hand sanitizer product in an attempt to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus which has currently infected over 100,000 people worldwide, resulting in around 3,800 deaths so far. 
Cuomo indicated the move is also to circumvent price-gouging of hand sanitizer. He claimed that the product is superior to others available due to a 75% alcohol content, greater than many other brands on the market. He said in a press briefing:
“We are introducing New York State clean hand sanitizer, made conveniently by the state of New York.”

The product is manufactured by Corcraft Products, which is run by the Department of Correctional Services, Division of Industries. The state plans to make 100,000 gallons per week using labor from inmates of New York’s prison system. According to their website, the organization claims to “employ inmates in substantive jobs that help teach a good work ethic and valuable work skills.”
As of Monday, New York State confirmed 142 cases of COVID-19, with most focused in the Westchester region of the state. New York declared a state of emergency on Saturday, when the number of people with confirmed COVID-19 was 89. According to Governor Cuomo, 8 of the 142 cases are currently hospitalized.

INDEPENDENT: Coronavirus: Space Images Reveal Drastic Fall in Pollution Over China as Factories Closed,"Satellite images over China show a dramatic reduction in pollution after the coronavirus outbreak shut down large portions of the country’s industry and travel.
According to Nasa, the change was at least partly related to the economic slowdown caused by efforts to contain the virus.
Closing industrial plants and urging people to stay home has led to sharp drops in the burning of fossil fuels, which is the world’s largest greenhouse gas producer. In mid-February, scientists observed that the coronavirus put a stop to at least a quarter of China’s greenhouse gas emissions in just two weeks.

The outbreak began in China, where there are more than 80,000 cases of coronavirus, by far the most significant number of any country, with a little over 2,900 deaths.
Maps from Nasa compare pollution levels between the first three weeks of the year and 10-25 February.
Nasa scientists said the drop in pollution was first visible near Wuhan, the source of the outbreak, but ultimately spread across the country.
Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said she had seen a decline in nitrogen dioxide levels during the economic recession of 2008 but said that decrease was more gradual, adding:

Netflix Viewers Freaked Out as ‘Pandemic’ Documentary Happens to Drop Amid Coronavirus Outbreak,"Netflix just released a brand new Pandemic docuseries amid the Coronavirus outbreak. And it has wreaked havoc among its viewers.
The six-part series show, which debuted on Netflix earlier this week, is called ‘Pandemic: How To Prevent An Outbreak’. It travels the earth to investigate potential viruses that could conceivably spread throughout an entire country or even the world, and whether or not we’d be able to manage such a pandemic.

But their efforts have not comforted everyone. Fearful fans have flocked to Twitter as the show’s airing coincided with the Coronavirus. Viewers wrote on Twitter:
‘Between this coronavirus outbreak and everyone I know having the flu, Netflix just dropped a new documentary series called “Pandemic” to scare us all even more. It’s creepy how @netflix just released a docu-series called “Pandemic” at the same time the #CoronaVirus is spreading.’1
Others quipped that they’d be more scared if The Simpsons were dealing with a Pandemic after their history of creepily accurate predictions.
‘I have seen the @netflix mini-docu about the next pandemic and with the Coronavirus, it’s super relevant to watch. BUT I will start worrying about it when @TheSimpsons make an episode about it.’1

Thousands of Gallons of Fuel Are Being Burned While Planes Fly Empty,"Due to aviation rules in Europe that state airlines operating out of the continent risk losing their business to competitors if they don’t continue to run 80% of their allocated slots, thousands of gallons of fuel have been wasted while planes fly empty amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The Times of London reported that UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps wrote a letter to Airport Coordination Limited, requesting that the rules be suspended, stating his concerns for even greater economic and environmental damage. Shapps wrote:
“I am particularly concerned that, in order to satisfy the 80/20 rule, airlines may be forced to fly aircraft at very low load factors, or even empty, in order to retain their slots. Such a scenario is not acceptable. It is not in the industry’s, the passengers’ or the environment’s interest and must be avoided.”

Airport Coordination Limited did suspend the rules for flights in and out of Hong Kong and China, however, the 80/20 rule remains in place for all other flights. According to The International Air Transport Association, the outbreak is projected to cost the airline industry up to $113 billion worldwide — losses similar to those the airline industry experienced in 2008, during the global financial crisis. Taking the brunt of the financial burden would be airlines in Europe and Asia.

FOX: Trump Announces Travel Ban From Europe Amid Growing Fears of Coronavirus,"Taking drastic action on Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced he is cutting off travel from 26 European nations to the U.S. and moving to ease the economic cost of a viral pandemic that is disturbing global financial markets and interrupting the daily lives of Americans.
Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump made the announcement that he is suspending all travel from Europe to the U.S. for 30 days, beginning late Friday, at midnight. Trump said:
“We made a lifesaving move with early action on China. Now we must take the same action with Europe.”
Trump said the restrictions wouldn’t apply to the United Kingdom, and there would be exemptions for “Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings.” He stated the U.S. would monitor the situation to determine if travel could resume earlier. He added:
“The virus will not have a chance against us. No nation is more prepared, or more resilient. We are all in this together. We must put politics aside, stop the partisanship and unified together as one nation, and one family.”

The announcement came on a day when, after the WHO declared the global crisis a pandemic, communities canceled public events nationwide, universities moved to cancel in-person classes, and families wrestled with the school closings. The number of confirmed cases of the infection in the U.S. topped 1,000.

Congress unveiled a multibillion-dollar aid package Wednesday that was expected to be voted on by the House as soon as Thursday. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said in testimony before the House Oversight and Reform Committee:
“I can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now. (The coronavirus is) Ten times more lethal than the seasonal flu.”
In anticipation of his remarks, White House aides tried to determine what action the president could take unilaterally and what required congressional action, as Trump personally weighed the public and political reactions to the prospects before him.
Trump said he was also directing agencies to provide undefined financial relief for “for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to coronavirus,” and asked Congress to take action to extend it.
Trump said the Small Business Administration would also make low-interest loans available to businesses to help them weather the storm. He said the U.S. would defer tax payments for some individual and business filers for three months to lessen the impacts of the virus outbreak. He added:
“This is not a financial crisis. This just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.”

Trump also reiterated his call on Congress to pass a cut to the federal payroll tax in order to stimulate the economy. However, that proposal was dismissed by many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. He remained silent on his previous calls to assist industries hard-hit by the pandemic like airlines and cruise ships.
An economic assistance plan was unveiled on Capitol Hill that was gaining bipartisan backing. Fundamental to the package is free coronavirus testing nationwide and emergency funding to reimburse lost paychecks for those self-quarantining, missing work, or losing jobs amid the outbreak. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, whom Trump tapped to negotiate with Nancy Pelosi, urged Congress “to pass legislation quickly.” Mnuchin said of the crisis:
“This is a little bit like a hurricane, and we need to cover these outside of normal expenses.”
For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.

The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Congress’ attending physician told staff there could be 70 million to 100 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. That’s on track with other estimates. A Harvard official has estimated that 20 percent to 60 percent of adults will get the virus, noting it’s “a pretty wide range.”

“He kept putting his head on the seat and kind of leaning back like he wasn’t feeling good.”.1
According to Rowe, the flight crew brought the ill passenger some medicine. She added:
“And the lady said, ‘My husband’s not going to take these.’ And she said, ‘No, you will take these otherwise this plane is landing right now.’ It was scary because they didn’t even tell him what he was taking. So that was kind of weird.”.1
The sick passenger eventually took the medication while a flight attendant wrote down the man’s travel information.

WSJ: The Foods That Help Battle Depression,"Recent studies show that the right kind of diet may give the brain more of what it needs to avoid depression, or even to treat it once it’s begun. So, when you’re feeling depressed, it might be a good idea to take a look at what you’ve been eating.
Over the past decade, a growing body of research reveals that a healthy diet – one high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, (and for those who eat meat, fish and unprocessed lean red meat) – can prevent depression. The research also reveals that an unhealthy diet – one high in processed and refined foods – increases the risk for the disease in everyone, including children and teens.
Depression has many causes. It may be genetic, triggered by a specific event or situation, such as loneliness (or the current COVID-19 pandemic), or brought on by lifestyle choices. But it’s ultimately about an unhealthy brain.
Trending Ancient Wellness Tips and Practices
Trending Ancient Wellness Tips and Practices
A poor diet fails to provide the brain with the variety of nutrients it needs, which makes depression worse. And processed, or deep-fried foods often contain trans fats that elevate inflammation, thought to be a foundation of depression. A lousy diet also affects our microbiome – the trillions of micro-organisms that live in our gut. These tiny but powerful organisms produce molecules that can alter the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter found in the brain. The good and bad bacteria in our gut have sophisticated ways to communicate with our brains and change our mood. Therefore, it makes sense that we need to maximize the good bacteria and minimize the bad.

The Endocannabinoid System and Human Health
The Endocannabinoid System and Human Health
Even though a good diet may not replace therapy or medication, people at risk for depression should pay attention to the food they eat. At the very least, it can serve as a supplemental treatment (with no dangerous side effects, unlike antidepressants) that also has an enormous upside. In essence, it can prevent other health problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. 
Wondering what you should eat to beat depression? According to the Wall Street Journal, experts say it’s important to eat a balanced, Mediterranean-style diet. But some nutrients are particularly helpful. Here are some examples, and which foods supply them:
Vitamin B6: An ingredient needed to produce serotonin, the main neurotransmitter that regulates mood and sleep. Too little serotonin is associated with depression. We need Vitamin B6 every day from our diet.
Sources: Pistachios. Garlic. Salmon and tuna. Chicken. Spinach. Cabbage. Bananas. Sweet potatoes. Avocados. Whole grains.
DHA: The main omega-3 fat in the brain. It promotes production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a hormone that protects neurons and promotes the birth of new brain cells. 
Sources: Marine based: Wild salmon. Oysters. Anchovies. Mackerel. Mussels. Plant based: Chia Seeds. Walnuts. Brussels Sprouts. Algal Oil. Hemp Seed. Flaxseeds. Perilla Oil. 
Prebiotics: Foods that the good microbes in our gut need to stay alive.
Sources: Onions. Asparagus. Artichokes. Garlic. Bananas. Oats.
Probiotics: Live bacteria and yeasts that replenish the good bacteria in our microbiome.
Sources: Yogurt. Sauerkraut. Kefir. Kimchi or other fermented vegetables, such as turnips, cucumbers, or carrots.

Vitamin C Works for Sepsis. Will It Work for Coronavirus?,"Story at-a-glance –
Sepsis is responsible for 1 in 5 deaths worldwide each year, killing 11 million out of 56 million people in 2017 alone. Sepsis is also one of the leading causes for influenza deaths
An IV protocol has been shown to dramatically improve chances of survival in septic patients. Giving adult patients 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1,500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%
Recent research has demonstrated the vitamin C-hydrocortisone-thiamine protocol lowers mortality in pediatric patients as well, from 28% to 9% in the first 30 days
In 2009, IV vitamin C was shown to be a potentially lifesaving treatment against severe swine flu. Even before that, many studies had demonstrated the usefulness of vitamin C against infections of various kinds
A randomized double-blind study published in 1994 found elderly patients given 200 milligrams of vitamin C per day while hospitalized for acute respiratory infection fared significantly better than those receiving a placebo
According to the most comprehensive global analysis1,2,3 done to date, sepsis is responsible for 1 in 5 deaths worldwide each year, killing 11 million out of 56 million people in 2017 alone. The researchers call the finding “alarming,” as their updated figures are double that of previous estimates.
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition triggered by a systemic infection that causes your body to overreact and launch an excessive and highly damaging immune response.
Unless promptly diagnosed and treated, it can rapidly progress to multiple-organ failure and death, so it’s crucial to be on the lookout for its signs and symptoms4,5,6 whenever you’re ill or in the hospital.
This includes cases of suspected influenza, as sepsis can mimic many of the signs and symptoms of flu. In fact, as discussed in “The Alarming Reason Some People Die From the Flu,” sepsis is one of the leading causes for influenza deaths.7
Sepsis May Be Responsible for 20% of Deaths Worldwide
Sepsis May Be Responsible for 20% of Deaths Worldwide
Vitamin C Protocol Lowers Sepsis Mortality
The good news is, a protocol of intravenous (IV) vitamin C with hydrocortisone and thiamine (vitamin B1) has been shown to dramatically improve chances of survival.8
This sepsis treatment protocol was developed Dr. Paul Marik, a critical care doctor at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital in East Virginia. His retrospective before-after clinical study9,10 showed giving patients 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1,500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%.
Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer, so there’s virtually no risk involved. More recent research,11,12 published online January 9, 2020, found Marik’s sepsis protocol lowered mortality in pediatric patients as well.
The study was performed at Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, and as noted by Science Daily,13 the preliminary data from this study “supports the promising outcomes seen in adults.” Between January 2014 and February 2019, 557 pediatric patients with septic shock met the criteria for inclusion in the study.
Forty-three received Mariks’s vitamin C-B1-hydrocortisone protocol, 181 received hydrocortisone-only therapy, and 333 received neither of these treatments. The 43 patients receiving the vitamin C treatment were matched based on clinical status with 43 untreated controls and 43 hydrocortisone-only patients.
At the 30-day mark, controls and the hydrocortisone-only groups had a mortality rate of 28% while the treatment group had a mortality rate of just 9%. At 90 days, 35% of the controls and 33% of those receiving hydrocortisone-only had died, compared to just 14% of the treatment group.14
As noted by the authors, “Our results suggest that HAT [hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid and thiamine] therapy, when administered early in the clinical course, reduces mortality in children with septic shock.”

How to survive Sepsis
Vitamin C Put to the Test Against Coronavirus
In 2009, IV vitamin C was shown to be a potentially lifesaving treatment against severe swine flu. Even before that, many studies had demonstrated the usefulness of vitamin C against infections of various kinds.
For example, a randomized double-blind study15 published in 1994 found elderly patients given 200 milligrams of vitamin C per day while hospitalized for acute respiratory infection fared significantly better than those receiving a placebo.
According to the authors, “This was particularly the case for those commencing the trial most severely ill, many of whom had very low plasma and white cell vitamin C concentrations on admission.”
Now, vitamin C will be put to the test against coronavirus as well. The study,16 “Vitamin C Infusion for the Treatment of Severe 2019-nCoV Infected Pneumonia” was posted to ClinicalTrials.gov February 11, 2020, and has not yet started recruiting patients. According to the study description:17
“At the end of 2019, patients with unexplained pneumonia appeared in Wuhan, China … Subsequently, the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus that caused the pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan as 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and the pneumonia was named severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). 
Up to February 4, 2020, over 20,000 cases have been diagnosed in China, 406 of which have died, and 154 cases have been discovered in other countries around the world. Most of the deaths were elderly patients or patients with severe underlying diseases … 
Statistics of the 41 patients with SARI published in JAMA initially showed that 13 patients were transferred into the ICU, of which 11 (85%) had ARDS and 3 (23%) had shock. Of these, 10 (77%) required mechanical ventilation support, and 2 (15%) required ECMO support. Of the above 13 patients, 5 (38%) eventually died and 7 (38%) were transferred out of the ICU. 
 Viral pneumonia is a dangerous condition with a poor clinical prognosis … Vitamin C, also known as ascorbic acid, has antioxidant properties. When sepsis happens, the cytokine surge caused by sepsis is activated, and neutrophils in the lungs accumulate in the lungs, destroying alveolar capillaries. Early clinical studies have shown that vitamin C can effectively prevent this process. 
 In addition, vitamin C can help to eliminate alveolar fluid by preventing the activation and accumulation of neutrophils, and reducing alveolar epithelial water channel damage. At the same time, vitamin C can prevent the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, which is a biological event of vascular injury caused by neutrophil activation.” 
The researchers intend to treat patients with 24 grams of IV vitamin C per day for seven days at a speed of 7 milliliters per hour. The placebo group will receive an IV of normal saline.
The primary outcome measure will be the number of days without ventilation support during 28 days of hospitalization. Secondary outcome measures will include mortality, ICU length of stay, the rate of CPR required, vasopressor use, respiratory function, sepsis-related organ failure and more.
Time will tell what the outcome will be, but chances are it will be favorable. Back in 2003 during the SARS pandemic, a Finnish researcher called for an investigation into the use of vitamin C, stating:18
“Recently, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In the absence of a specific treatment for SARS, the possibility that vitamin C may show nonspecific effects on several viral respiratory tract infections should be considered.
There are numerous reports indicating that vitamin C may affect the immune system, for example the function of phagocytes, transformation of T lymphocytes and production of interferon. In particular, vitamin C increased the resistance of chick embryo tracheal organ cultures to infection caused by an avian coronavirus.19”
He goes on to cite research showing vitamin C also protects broiler chicks against avian coronavirus, cuts the duration and severity of common cold in humans and significantly lowers susceptibility to pneumonia. Unfortunately, it doesn’t appear as though vitamin C was ever studied in relation to SARS, but it’s encouraging that China is now investigating its use against 2019-nCoV.
Vitamin C Doubles Effectiveness of Chemotherapy and Radiation
Vitamin C Doubles Effectiveness of Chemotherapy and Radiation
Health Benefits of Vitamin C Are Vastly Underappreciated
Vitamin C has two major functions that help explain its potent health benefits. First, it acts as a powerful antioxidant. It also acts as a cofactor for enzymatic processes. One of the most famous forerunners of high dose vitamin C treatment for colds and other disease was Linus Carl Pauling (1901-1994), a biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1954.
Despite that, many felt he was too far out of his field of expertise with his research into nutrition, and his advocacy for vitamin C was largely ignored or mocked by mainstream medicine and nutritional science — with medical bloggers leading the pack as self-appointed judges of Pauling’s findings.20
Others, however, have picked up on what Pauling was trying to point out, and are now trying to awaken the world to just how important vitamin C is for good health and vitality.21 As explained by the Linus Pauling Institute:22
“Vitamin C is the primary water-soluble, non-enzymatic antioxidant in plasma and tissues. Even in small amounts vitamin C can protect indispensable molecules in the body, such as proteins, lipids (fats), carbohydrates, and nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), from damage by free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are generated during normal metabolism, by active immune cells, and through exposure to toxins and pollutants …”
According to Dr. Ronald Hunninghake, an internationally recognized expert on vitamin C who has personally supervised tens of thousands of IV vitamin C administrations, vitamin C is “definitely a very underutilized modality in infectious disease,” considering “it’s really a premiere treatment” for infections.
In my interview with him, Hunninghake suggested one of the reasons why conventional medicine has been so slow to recognize the importance of vitamin C has to do with the fact that they’ve been looking at it as a mere vitamin, when in fact it’s a potent oxidizing agent that can help eliminate pathogens when given in high doses.
There are also financial factors. In short, it’s too inexpensive. Conventional medicine, as a general rule, is notoriously uninterested in solutions that cannot produce significant profits.
However, considering sepsis is now the most expensive condition treated in the U.S., costing $23.6 billion annually,23,24 the need for an affordable solution is becoming critical. This is particularly true for lower income nations, where an estimated 85% of sepsis-related deaths occur.25 Global pandemics like the coronavirus also call for lower-cost treatments that actually work.
Research Proving Vitamin C’s Therapeutic Value in 200+ Diseases
Recognize the Symptoms of Sepsis
When it comes to sepsis, which can result from just about any infection, time is of the essence. It’s really important to familiarize yourself with its signs and symptoms, and to take immediate action if you suspect sepsis.
While the signs can be subtle at first, sepsis typically produces the following signs and symptoms:26,27,28 Many of these symptoms may be confused with a bad cold or flu. However, they tend to develop quicker than you would normally expect.
The Sepsis Alliance recommends using the acronym TIME to remember some of the more common symptoms:29
T — Temperature higher or lower than normal?
I — Have you now or recently had any signs of an infection?
M — Are there any changes in mental status, such as confusion or excessive sleepiness?
E — Are you experiencing any extreme pain or illness; do you have a “feeling you may die?”
Another acronym you could use to memorize the signs and symptoms is SEPSIS, described in the video above:
S — Shivering (fever, cold)
E — Extreme pain
P — Pale, clammy skin
S — Shortness of breath
I — “I feel like I might die”
S — Sleepy (confused)
Educational Resources for Your Doctor
Marik’s sepsis protocol can be a lifesaver, so you’d be wise to discuss it with your doctor any time you’re hospitalized. Remember, sepsis is often the result of a secondary infection contracted while in the hospital, so it’s prudent to be prepared.
This way, should you develop sepsis while you’re admitted, your medical team already knows your wishes and can act swiftly. According to Marik, the best results are obtained when the concoction is administered within the first six hours of presentation of symptoms.30 The longer you delay treatment, the less likely it will be successful.
If your doctor refuses to consider it offhand, convince him or her to review the studies cited here.31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39 While there are certain situations in which the hospital may still deny this treatment, if you are an adult who is sick, you will usually have the right to insist on it. I will actually be interviewing Marik shortly and hope to work with him on developing a process to make it easier for patients to implement this strategy in their local hospital.
In most cases, you’d probably just need to sign an “Against Medical Advice — Acknowledgment and Waiver” form (samples of which can be found in the references40), which states you’ve elected to not follow the standard of care recommended by your doctor.
Contraindication for IV Vitamin C Treatment
The only contraindication to high-dose vitamin C treatments such as Marik’s sepsis protocol is if you are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient, which is a genetic disorder.41 G6PD is required for your body to produce NADPH, which is a cousin of NAD+ and necessary to transfer reductive potential to keep your antioxidants, like glutathione and vitamin C, functional.
Because your red blood cells do not contain any mitochondria, the only way it can provide reduced glutathione is through NADPH, and since G6PD eliminates this, it causes red blood cells to rupture due to inability to compensate for oxidative stress.
Fortunately, G6PD deficiency is relatively uncommon, and can be tested for. People of Mediterranean and African decent are at greater risk of being G6PD deficient. Worldwide, G6PD deficiency is thought to affect 400 million individuals, and in the U.S., an estimated 1 in 10 African-American males has it. 42

Novel Coronavirus — The Latest Pandemic Scare,"Story at-a-glance –
As of January 27, 2020, China reported 2,835 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia (NCIP), including 76 deaths. The first case was reported in December 2019. Since then, cases have also been reported in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and France
Clinical manifestations of NCIP are consistent with viral pneumonia
The hysteria being drummed up follows a well-worn pattern where the population is kept in a state of fear about microbes so that drug companies can come to the rescue with yet another expensive (and potentially mandatory) drug or vaccine
In January 2018, China’s first biosecurity level 4 lab designed for the study of the world’s most dangerous pathogens opened its doors in Wuhan City, the epicenter of the current NCIP outbreak
October 18, 2019, Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sponsored a pandemic preparedness exercise in New York, practicing for the emergence of a new fictional viral illness dubbed “coronavirus acute pulmonary syndrome” 

Chances are you’ve heard the news about a new and potentially lethal coronavirus.1 Ground zero is Wuhan City, Hubei Province in China. As of January 27, 2020, China reported2,3 2,835 confirmed cases across at least 29 provinces, including 177 severe cases and 76 deaths (including a retired doctor working with coronavirus patients in Wuhan4).
Thirty-four patients had recovered and been discharged as of January 22, 2020. The first case was reported December 21, 2019. According to ProMED International Society for Infectious Diseases:5
“Patients’ clinical manifestations were consistent with viral pneumonia. Most patients had severe and nonproductive cough following illness onset, some had dyspnea, and almost all had normal or decreased leukocyte counts and radiographic evidence of pneumonia.
Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market has western and eastern sections, and 15 environmental specimens collected in the western section were positive for 2019-nCoV virus through RT-PCR testing and genetic sequencing analysis. Despite extensive searching, no animal from the market has thus far been identified as a possible source of infection.”
On January 21, 2020, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case6 — a patient in Washington state who had recently visited Wuhan, China. A second case, in Illinois, was confirmed January 24, 2020.7 This patient had also recently returned from a visit to Wuhan.
Since then cases have also been reported in Canada, Australia,8 Japan, Thailand, South Korea,9 France,10 Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore and Saudi Arabia.11 January 22, 2020, China shut down all transport networks in and out of Wuhan — a city with a population of 11 million — in an effort to contain the spread of the disease.12

Elderly Appear Particularly Vulnerable
So far, most of those who have died have been elderly. As reported by the Foreign Policy Journal:13
“One puzzling aspect so far is the thankful lack of child victims. Usually, children, with less developed immune systems than adults, come down with one illness after another … 
Yet few children have yet been reported with coronavirus symptoms. That does not mean that no children have been infected. A similar pattern of benign disease in children, with increasing severity and mortality with age, was seen in SARS and MERS. 
SARS had a mortality rate averaging 10 percent. Yet no children, and just 1 percent of youths under 24, died, while those older than 50 had a 65 percent risk of dying. Is being an adult a risk factor per se? If so, what is it about childhood that confers protection?”
The Foreign Policy Journal goes on to suggest children may be protected by other vaccines given during childhood, such as the measles and rubella vaccines. It even goes so far as to wonder whether innate immunity against the coronavirus might be boosted in adults by giving them the measles vaccine.
If you ask me, that would be a significant long-shot. Vaccines have risks, so getting a vaccine on the remote chance that it might confer protection against a completely different infection than what it’s designed for seems inappropriate in the extreme. As noted in the Washington Examiner:14
“Sending out coronavirus vaccines won’t make sense unless the spread gets worse … The bare facts, at least as far as anyone knows them yet, are that a global rollout of a coronavirus vaccine would kill some 7,000 people or so. 
Of course, we’re never going to get everyone vaccinated. And I’m guessing here, but that average death rate from vaccination, for all things, is one in a million. 
Yes, that’s including those influenza shots the old folks are abjured to get every winter — we know that some will die because of them. That we know this is exactly why we have the vaccine compensation program …
The … trade-off in this situation is how many we kill by giving them the vaccine, versus how many die without it? The coronavirus is simply not widespread enough yet to take the risk of jabbing everyone.”

Source of Novel Coronavirus Remains Unknown
Like other coronaviruses, such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), this new coronavirus (dubbed 2019-nCoV15), is suspected of being zoonotic, meaning it can be transmitted between animals and humans.
The disease itself has been named “novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia” or NECIP.16 As reported by CNN:17
“Both SARS and MERS are classified as zoonotic viral diseases, meaning the first patients who were infected acquired these viruses directly from animals. 
This was possible because while in the animal host, the virus had acquired a series of genetic mutations that allowed it to infect and multiply inside humans. Now these viruses can be transmitted from person to person …
In the case of this 2019 coronavirus outbreak, reports state that most of the first group of patients hospitalized were workers or customers at a local seafood wholesale market which also sold processed meats and live consumable animals including poultry, donkeys, sheep, pigs, camels, foxes, badgers, bamboo rats, hedgehogs and reptiles.”
However, while media have been quick to blame the outbreak on snakes18 and bat soup,19 as of January 22, none of the animals sold at the Wuhan Huanan Wholesale Seafood Market had been found to carry the virus.20
Meanwhile, a number of other reports cast a disturbing light on the outbreak, raising questions about biohazard safety at laboratories working with dangerous pathogens.
Season of Fear and National Budgeting Go Hand in Hand
Whatever the source, the hysteria being drummed up follows a now well-worn pattern where the population is kept in a perpetual state of anxiety and fear about microbes so that drug companies (aided by federal health officials) can come to the rescue with yet another expensive (and potentially mandatory) drug or vaccine.
Back in 2005, headlines warned the U.S. was facing a cataclysmic extermination event with a calculated 2 million Americans succumbing to the bird flu; the best-case scenario had a calculated death toll of 200,000. The same scare tactics were used during the 2009 swine flu outbreak.
Both pandemics turned out to be grossly exaggerated threats, but that didn’t result in a more conservative, cool-headed approach to subsequent outbreaks. If anything, efforts to drum up fear and hysteria have only escalated.
In 2014, we were told Ebola might overtake the U.S. and then it was pertussis outbreaks.21 In January 2015, it was measles in Disneyland. In January 2016, it was zika, followed by more news about pertussis outbreaks.22 In 2017 and 2018 it was influenza,23 then back to measles again in 2019.24 Now we have coronavirus.
January and February appear to be a favorite time to launch a global disease scare with the dutiful assistance of corporatized media. It’s convenient, seeing how usually by the first Monday in February every year (Feb. 3, 2020), the president sends the U.S. Congress the administration’s budget requesting funds to be allocated to federal agencies for the next fiscal year’s budget (Oct. 1, 2020 – Sept. 30, 2021).25
Each time there’s a public health scare, the Pharma and public health lobby is able to vie for a larger slice of taxpayer money to pay for drug and vaccine development.26
January 23, 2020, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, announced a coronavirus vaccine is in the pipeline, with human trials set to start in about three months.27 Stock prices for makers of coronavirus vaccines experienced an immediate upswing28,29 in response to media reports of impending doom.
Moratorium on SARS/MERS Experiments Lifted in 2017
As mentioned, a number of reports raise questions about the source of the 2019-nCoV. For starters, a 2014 NPR article30 was rather prophetic. It discusses the October 2014 U.S. moratorium on experiments on coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, as well as influenza virus, that might make the viruses more pathogenic and/or easy to spread among humans.
The ban came on the heels of “high-profile lab mishaps” at the CDC and “extremely controversial flu experiments” in which the bird flu virus was engineered to become more lethal and contagious between ferrets. The goal was to see if it could mutate and become more lethal and contagious between humans, causing future pandemics.
However, for the past decade there have been red flags raised in the scientific community about biosecurity breaches in high containment biological labs in the U.S. and globally.31 There were legitimate fears that a lab-created superflu pathogen might escape the confines of biosecurity labs where researchers are conducting experiments. It’s a reasonable fear, certainly, considering that there have been many safety breaches at biolabs in the U.S. and other countries.32,33,34,35
The federal moratorium on lethal virus experiments in the U.S. was lifted at the end of December 2017,36 even though researchers announced in 2015 they had created a lab-created hybrid coronavirus similar to that of SARS that was capable of infecting both human airway cells and mice.
The NIH had allowed the controversial research to proceed because it had begun before the moratorium was put in place — a decision criticized by Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at Pasteur Institute in Paris, who pointed out that “If the [new] virus escaped, nobody could predict the trajectory.”37
Others, such as Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biodefence expert at Rutgers University, agreed, saying “The only impact of this work is the creation, in a lab, of a new, non-natural risk.”38

Wuhan Is Home to Lab Studying World’s Deadliest Pathogens
In January 2018, China’s first maximum security virology laboratory (biosecurity level 4) designed for the study of the world’s most dangerous pathogens opened its doors — in Wuhan.39,40 Is it pure coincidence that Wuhan City is now the epicenter of this novel coronavirus infection?
The year before, Tim Trevan, a Maryland biosafety consultant, expressed concern about viral threats potentially escaping the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory,41 which happens to be located just 20 miles from the Wuhan market identified as ground zero for the current NCIP outbreak.42 As reported by the Daily Mail:43
“The Wuhan lab is also equipped for animal research,” and “Regulations for animal research — especially that conducted on primates — are much looser in China than in the U.S. and other Western countries … But that was also cause for concern for Trevan. 
Studying the behavior of a virus like 209-nCoV and developing treatments or vaccines for it requires infecting these research monkeys, an important step before human testing. 
Monkeys are unpredictable though, warned [Rutgers University microbiologist Dr. Richard] Ebright. ‘They can run, they can scratch they can bite,’ he said, and the viruses they carry would go where their feet, nails and teeth do.'” 
Coronavirus Outbreak Simulation Took Place in October 2019
Equally curious is the fact that Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation sponsored a novel coronavirus pandemic preparedness exercise October 18, 2019, in New York called “Event 201.”44 The simulation predicted a global death toll of 65 million people within a span of 18 months.45 As reported by Forbes December 12, 2019:46
“The experts ran through a carefully designed, detailed simulation of a new (fictional) viral illness called CAPS or coronavirus acute pulmonary syndrome. This was modeled after previous epidemics like SARS and MERS.” 
Sounds exactly like NCIP, doesn’t it? Yet the new coronavirus responsible for NCIP had not yet been identified at the time of the simulation, and the first case wasn’t reported until two months later.
Forbes also refers to the fictional pandemic as “Disease X” — the same designation used by The Telegraph in its January 24, 2020, video report, “Could This Coronavirus be Disease X?”47 which suggests that media outlets were briefed and there was coordination ahead of time with regard to use of certain keywords and catchphrases in news reports and opinion articles.
Johns Hopkins University (JHU) is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense and has received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.48 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.49
If research funded by federal agencies, such as the DOD or HHS is classified as being performed “in the interest of national security,” it is exempt from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests.50
Research conducted under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) is completely shielded from FOIA requests by the public.51 Additionally, agencies may deny FOIA requests and withhold information if government officials conclude that shielding it from public view “protects trade secrets and commercial or financial information which could harm the competitive posture or business interests of a company.”52
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services states that its mission is “to protect America from health, safety and security threats, both foreign and in the U.S.”53 Clearly, it will be difficult to obtain information about government-funded biomedical research on microbes like coronavirus conducted at major universities or by pharmaceutical corporations in biohazard labs.
How likely is it, then, that the coronavirus outbreak making people so sick today “suddenly” emerged simply because people ate bats and snakes in a Wuhan market? It looks more like a biosecurity accident but, until more is known, inevitably there will be questions than answers about whether this latest global public health emergency is a more ambitious tactical “sand table exercise,” echoing unanswered questions about the 2009 swine flu pandemic fiasco.
This time, there could be a lot more bodies left on the field, although some statisticians conducting benefit cost analyses may consider 65 million casualties in a global human population of 7.8 billion people54 to be relatively small when advancing medical research conducted in the name of “the greater good.”

Signs and Symptoms of NCIP
According to the WHO, signs and symptoms of NCIP in its initial stages include:55
Fever
Fatigue
Sore throat
Shortness of breath
Dry cough
In more severe cases, the infection can lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and kidney failure.
Care Advice
WHO’s “rapid advice note,” detailing how to care for patients presenting mild symptoms of NCIP in the home can be downloaded here. Recommendations include:
Placing the patient in a well-ventilated room
Limiting the number of caretakers. Ideally, designate a healthy younger person who has no underlying risk factors to care for the patient (older people appear to be more susceptible to severe disease)
Keeping other household members in a different room, or keeping a distance of at least 1 meter (3.2 feet) from the patient
Limiting the movement of the patient and minimizing shared space. Make sure shared spaces such as kitchen and bathroom are well-ventilated by keeping the windows open
Instructions on protective gear, such as protective masks and gloves, and the safe handling and disposal of them are also detailed, as are special instructions for how to maintain good hygiene to prevent the spread of the virus throughout the home.
General recommendations for how to reduce your risk of contracting an infection at home, work or when traveling can be found on WHO’s Novel Coronavirus Advice for the Public page.56
A key recommendation — which applies to all infections, both bacterial and viral — is to frequently wash your hands with soap and water. Also, be sure to cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and avoid close contact with anyone exhibiting symptoms of cold or influenza.
According to Peter Horby, professor of emerging infectious diseases and global health at the Centre of Tropical Medicine and Global Health at the University of Oxford, NCIP has the hallmark signs of “classic viral pneumonia,” and since there are currently no antivirals available for NCIP, the focus of care is to support the lungs and other organs until the patient recovers.57
During this time, I recommend boosting your immune system with regular sensibly controlled sun exposure and, when unable to do that, taking oral vitamin D3. Adding liposomal vitamin C and quercetin supplements can also be helpful.
All three help protect against infections in general, and quercetin may offer benefits as a treatment for SARS coronavirus infections.58 According to a study59 in the Journal of Virology, “quercetin offers great promise as a potential drug in the clinical treatment of SARS.” Resveratrol is another antioxidant that could be useful. It’s been shown to inhibit MERS-CoV infection, at least in vitro.60
There are some events that happen, which are not in our control, but one thing we can do is learn how to better respond to bad news that causes stress, which can depress the immune system.
Living in a constant state of anxiety and fear is not healthy. Finding ways to lower stress through regular exercise, spending time in nature, practicing meditation and getting plenty of sleep on a daily basis all help optimize immune function and decrease the effects of stress that are all too often a part of our lives today.

Huawei Helps Fight Coronavirus by Building 5G Base Stations in Wuhan,"China’s tech giant Huawei just announced their support for the Hubei branches of China Mobile and China Unicom to set up 5G base stations in Wuhan Vulcan Mountain Hospital to help fight the Coronavirus.
In case you were not aware, Wuhan Vulcan Mountain Hospital is the facility China is trying to build as quickly as possible to fight against the Coronavirus epidemic. The building follows the model of the Beijing Xiaotangshan Hospital, a hospital in China’s capital city that was built in only seven days.

On January 23, Huawei’ s representatives for the Hubei region instantly set up a Coronavirus outbreak protection project team, providing a workforce of approximately 150 people. According to GizChina:
From receiving the notification from the Wuhan City Epidemic Prevention and Control Emergency Center to the commissioning of 5G base stations, the entire construction from network planning, survey, design and construction to fiber laying, erecting base stations and commissioning was completed in just 3 days.
Currently, the three major operators in Hubei have already established and prepared a 5G network near the hospital that will help the Vulcan Mountain Hospital achieve ultra-high-speed network connectivity. These services will ensure high-speed data access, data collection, remote consultation, remote monitoring, and other medical services.

Besides fully supporting the operator’s 5G network construction, Huawei also organized a special protection team. The team includes research, development, and direct supply to ensure the normal operations of the Hubei Health and Medical Commission video conference system. 
This system is an essential consultation platform for the Hubei Health Commission, National Health Commission, and other provinces’ health commissions to ensure that the online medical meetings take place.
Chinese tech giant Lenovo, along with a handful of additional Chinese tech companies, also did something similar by sending their technical support to the region.

"FOX: Walmart, Publix Among Grocery Stores Installing Plexiglass Barriers, Social Distancing Markers Amid Outbreak","Major grocery stores like Walmart, Kroger, Albertsons, Publix, and others are adding plexiglass barriers to keep customers and employees safe during the coronavirus outbreak.
Both Walmart and Kroger shared that supermarkets would be adding temporary plexiglass sneeze guards to pharmacy lanes and checkout counters.
On Tuesday, Walmart confirmed that all locations across the country will install the plexiglass shields at store registers in the next 2 to 3 weeks. The company will also be placing the barriers at both Walmart and Sam’s Club pharmacy lanes during the same time.

Kroger, which operates several regional chains such as Ralphs, Smith’s, and others, also said it would be adding the sneeze guards on Tuesday to its more than 2,700 stores in the coming weeks.
Albertsons grocery stores, which own and operate supermarket chains including Safeway, Shaws, Star Market, and Acme, among others, has already started installing the plexiglass barriers to its checkouts. They hope for installation to be completed by the end of March.

Publix also announced this week it would be installing the guards to its store registers.
In addition to the sneeze guards designed to protect both customers and employees, the major grocery store chains have also installed floor decals and waiting points as social distancing tools designed to keep customers six feet away from each other. A press release from Walmart said:
“Over the coming days and week we are installing floor decals in our stores at both the entrances and in checkout lanes, making it easier for customers to judge the proper social distance from each other.”

What We Can Learn From a Pandemic “Tabletop Exercise”,"By Mary Holland, CHD General Counsel and Vice Chair
We are living in unfamiliar times. We are frightened by the highly infectious coronavirus CoV-2019 or COVID-19, and our hearts go out to those who have been directly affected. We are in a global “lockdown,” “sheltering in place,” against an invisible but potentially deadly enemy. Our world has changed rapidly and dramatically since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
Most of us are still in a kind of shock usually limited to wartime. It remains hard to believe that countries around the world are ordering businesses and schools to shut down, citizens to stay home, and pausing all communal life to preserve the public health. We have moved to a world of physical isolation and only virtual connection to friends and community. The world’s economy is on the brink of a depression to avert the worst-case public health scenario.
Event 201: A Pandemic Simulation
Although most of us have been caught by surprise, some in business and government circles have been preparing for just such a pandemic for a long time. On October 18, 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation together convened a group of fifteen participants from leading industries and global institutions to participate in a fictional pandemic exercise entitled “Event 201.” This invitation-only “tabletop exercise,” a term typically used for wargames, occurred at the Hotel Pierre in New York City.
After the day-long exercise, the consortium produced several high quality videos of their deliberations. “Event 201” has six segments: an 11-minute “highlights” video and five additional segments of about an hour each on 1: Countermeasures, 2: Trade and Travel, 3: Finance, 4: Communications, and 5: Hotwash and Conclusion.

Who’s Who
Key participants at the table were representatives of the Johns Hopkins Center, the Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum, which were the institutions sponsoring the exercise. The corporate and government participants’ names and affiliations are below. (Governments also conduct their own simulation exercises; the press recently reported on a Trump Administration drill called “Crimson Contagion.”)
Missing from Event 201 were legislators; representatives of small and medium-sized businesses; labor; social media; religious leaders; and civil society unaffiliated with intergovernmental and corporate organizations. In short, the participants were a heavyweight group of corporate executives, policymakers, and health officials. Left out were representatives from many sectors likely to be hardest hit by such a scenario.
The participants included:
Latoya Abbott, Risk Management & Global Senior Director Occupational Health Services, Marriott International
Sofia Borges, Senior Vice President, UN Foundation
Brad Connett, President, U.S. Medical Group, Henry Schein, Inc.
Christopher Elias, President, Global Development division, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
Tim Evans, Former Senior Director of Health, World Bank Group
George Gao, Director-General, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention
Avril Haines, Former Deputy Director, Central Intelligence Agency; Former Deputy National Security Advisor
Jane Halton, Board member, ANZ Bank; Former Secretary of Finance & Former Secretary of Health, Australia
Matthew Harrington, Global Chief Operations Officer, Edelman
Martin Knuchel, Head of Crisis, Emergency and Business Continuity Management, Lufthansa Group Airlines
Eduardo Martinez, President, The UPS Foundation
Stephen Redd, Deputy Director for Public Health Service and Implementation Science, US CDC
Hasti Taghi, Vice President & Executive Advisor, NBCUniversal Media
Adrian Thomas, Vice President, Global Public Health, Johnson & Johnson
Lavan Thiru, Chief Representative, Monetary Authority of Singapore
Yesterday’s Simulation Mirrors Today’s Reality
Coincidentally, the participants addressed a simulated global pandemic from a coronavirus that initially showed up in bats, then pigs, and finally  jumped to humans before spreading rapidly around the world despite the players’ best efforts. The simulation imagined no available vaccine. In the background, rhythmic music pulsated in a minor key.
The pandemic scenario had the following parameters:
The scenario ends at the 18-month point, with 65 million deaths. The pandemic is beginning to slow due to the decreasing number of susceptible people. The pandemic will continue at some rate until there is an effective vaccine or until 80-90 % of the global population has been exposed. From that point on, it is likely to be an endemic childhood disease.
The organizers pulled vignettes from the five plus hours for the “Highlights” below.
Travel Bans
The participants first address travel advisories and bans as they learn that travel industry revenues have dropped 45%. The World Bank Group representative explains that to rely on the United Nations in such a situation would be “delusional.” The world must turn to the private sector for “efficient leadership.” The Gates Foundation representative notes that only the private sector has the knowledge to negotiate the complex supply chain issues, underscoring the need for a “new kind of public-private collaboration.”
Economic Collapse
The participants learn from a news report that the stock market has fallen 20-40%. The discussants wonder if there are institutions that they “cannot allow to fail.” They see governments as the best source of financing and discuss tax breaks and subsidies to “escalate entrepreneurship.” The U.S. CDC representative adds that “it’s really a war footing we need to be on.”
The banker also questions whether there might be a technological answer to the problem, perhaps implying online censorship.
Pandemic ‘could wipe out 900 million people,’ experts warn
Pandemic ‘could wipe out 900 million people,’ experts warn
Disinformation and Misinformation
Next, the participants tackle the question of intentional “disinformation” and accidental “misinformation.” They note that “limited internet shutdowns are being implemented to quell panic.” They worry that “misinformation is undercutting efforts to control the panic.” The representative from Edelman, a global PR behemoth, notes that social media companies must now step up as “broadcasters” and no longer just see themselves as technology platforms. They must “counteract, if not flood the zone” with accurate information based on partnering with “the scientific and health communities.” The representative of the Monetary Authority of Singapore wonders whether governments might not step up their enforcement actions against “fake news.”
By contrast, the private sector banker at the table remarks that it is “neither practical nor desirable” to shut down information, but agrees that the “flood strategy” is promising, capitalizing on “trusted sources of information.” The banker also questions whether there might be a technological answer to the problem, perhaps implying online censorship.
Effects of the Pandemic
In the video epilogue, the narrator states that 65 million people died in the first 18 months. While the numbers at first seemed controllable, the disease spread to densely populated, impoverished megacities where the death toll exploded. Within six months, cases occurred in nearly every country, and the “global economy was in a freefall.” She explained that the economic effects “lasted for years, perhaps a decade.” But even more significantly, she outlined that the societal impact – “loss of faith in government, distrust of news, breakdown of social cohesion – could last even longer.” Finally, she asked if we could have done anything differently, and answered, “yes.” She concluded, “Are we as a global community now finally ready to do the hard work to prepare for the next pandemic?”
Just two months after the Event 201 New York simulation, China announced the first case of COVID-19…
The Real Coronavirus Crisis
Many aspects of the Event 201 simulation ring true today. The coronavirus pandemic; new public-private partnerships; travel bans; markets in freefall; a wartime footing; and flooding the information zone with controlled messaging. That the video sponsors are now some of the central actors in the real world crisis only amplifies the simulation’s significance.
Just two months after the New York simulation, China announced the first case of COVID-19 on December 31, 2019. Chinese scientists identified and isolated the virus on January 7, 2020. On January 22, 2020, the WHO Emergency Committee “expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) or not.”
At around the same time, the World Economic Forum met in Davos, Switzerland, January 21-24, 2020. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as well as other Event 201 participants were there. On January 24, another Gates Foundation entity engaged in vaccine development, the The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI), held a press conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos to provide an update on the outbreak, and announced a new partnership to develop vaccines for the virus as quickly as possible – before the outbreak became a global epidemic.
Some speculate that the WHO decision to declare the emergency was made on the sidelines of the Davos meeting, perhaps in connection with the CEPI decision to prioritize coronavirus vaccines. The WHO Emergency Committee meeting in Geneva occurred in the same time frame on January 22. While any direct connection remains uncertain, Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020. The World Economic Forum immediately pledged its assistance, creating the COVID Action Platform, thus turning the fictional exercise into a high level working group behind the WHO. On January 31, 2020, the U.S. announced a travel ban on China, and events have evolved quickly since then.
Is China ground zero for a future pandemic?
WHO’s Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus
Mr. Ghebreyesus has been the WHO Director General since 2017. He’s the first African director and the first Director General who is not a physician. As Ethiopia’s Minister of Health, Mr. Ghebreyesus chaired the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria that the Gates Foundation co-founded. Today, the Gates Foundation is the WHO’s largest donor after the U.S., and the major funder behind the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization (GAVI), another WHO funder.
Is There Any “Benefit” to the Catastrophe?
The Event 201 tabletop exercise shows us the kind of thinking going on as this crisis unfolds. It begs the question whether there can be any “benefit” from such a catastrophe.
According to the August 2019 Gallup poll below, before the crisis, the healthcare industry, the federal government, and the pharmaceutical industry were at the very bottom of the public’s esteem. Negative perceptions ranged from minus 48% for healthcare, minus 52% for the federal government, to a stark minus 58% for pharma. The only other sector in negative territory was the advertising and public relations industry, also represented at the Event 201 table.

The public may have held negative perceptions for a number of possible reasons:
Medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the U.S., after heart disease and cancer.
The pharma-driven opioid epidemic caused drug overdose deaths to skyrocket, with the financial cost of the opioid epidemic from 2015-18 at $2.5 trillion, not to mention the human cost of over 500,000 lives;
The pharmaceutical industry paid $35.7 billion in penalties to federal and state governments in recent years for a wide range of illegal activities. Despite civil and criminal fines, no pharma senior executive has gone to jail. Fines were simply the cost of doing business.
The federal government failed to hold corporate actors accountable in the aftermath of the 2008 recession, with a sole executive sent to jail. People lost homes, livelihoods, businesses, pensions and suffered for a decade.
The COVID-19 virus has played a stunning role, shifting public perceptions almost overnight, lifting up the sectors that had been just months ago at the bottom.
Remarkably, the pandemic seems to have pushed a “global reset” button. Pharma and biotech companies are racing to produce new coronavirus vaccines, with the expectation that the world’s population will clamor for them. Media follows the healthcare sector’s every move, creating genuine heroes among the doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers on the frontlines. Even this Administration, long plagued by low popularity ratings, has reached its highest approval rating ever.
In a crisis, people want strong leaders and want to be on their teams, regardless of political leaning. In the new age of COVID-19, people are tuning in to federal health authorities, Congress, and the President, and grateful for whatever drugs and potential vaccines pharma and the healthcare industries put out. The COVID-19 virus thus has played a stunning role, shifting public perceptions almost overnight, lifting up the sectors that had been just months ago at the bottom.
What we can learn 100 years after the Spanish Influenza pandemic of 1918

Not to say that people are not critical – they are – but pharma and healthcare stocks are rising, literally and figuratively, while most every other sector is plummeting, and Congress and the President are addressing the crisis and communicating with the public on a daily basis, and people are listening.
Despite all the shifts, one thing is certain: change is the dynamic constant. Who knows what will happen in a month, or two months, or eighteen? “Event 201” offers some important insights into public-private crisis management and what could lie ahead.
