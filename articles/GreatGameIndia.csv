Does WHO Work For The Interest Of The Vaccine Industry,"Vaccines have helped mankind to tackle the dire threat of infectious disease for more than a hundred years. They have become key tools of public health and scientists are charged with developing them as quickly as possible to combat the emergence of new diseases such as Zika, SARS, Ebola and Coronavirus. But why are growing numbers of parents all over the world now questioning the wisdom of having their children vaccinated? Why have public-sector vaccine producers been sold off? And can we trust the multinational corporations that increasingly dominate vaccine development and production?
In this controversial book renowned author Stuart Blume discloses that many of the most influential advisers, at both World Health Organisation (WHO) and national levels, are paid consultants to the vaccine industry raising a very serious question – that the WHO might be working for the vaccine industry’s interests and not the people.

In recent years, there have been more and more warnings that a pandemic as deadly as that of 1918 is imminent. In 2009 HIN1, the strain that really worries virologists, returned. Though it was an HINI virus, it was not identical to the HIN1 virus involved in the 1976 ‘epidemic’.
Analysis showed that it was a new strain of H1N1, formed by an existing blend (the proper term is ʻreassortment’) of bird, swine and human flu viruses, further combined with a pig flu virus, thus leading to the term ‘swine flu’.
The virus seems to have emerged in Veracruz, in Mexico, which is why it also acquired the name ‘Mexican flu’. The Mexican government closed down most of the city’s public facilities in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus, but it nevertheless spread around the world. Unlike most strains of influenza, and to the surprise of epidemiologists, this virus was found disproportionately to infect younger adults rather than the elderly.
In June 2009 the WHO declared the outbreak to be a pandemic. This decision was based not on advice from its permanent vaccine advisory committee (known as the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts, or SAGE), but on the advice of an emergency committee, the names of whose members were not made public at the time.
The announcement of a pandemic automatically triggered the conditional orders for vaccine that rich countries had already placed with vaccine manufacturers. The governments of many European countries ordered two doses for every inhabitant, amounting to hundreds of millions of doses, costing hundreds of millions of euros. Fortunately, or unfortunately, by the time the bulk of the vaccine orders had been delivered the number of cases was already tapering off.
In the summer of 2010 the WHO announced that the pandemic had ended. The virus had been far less deadly than experts had predicted. Estimates of how many people died from this HINI epidemic vary widely (from ten thousand to some hundreds of thousands) and have been disputed.
What does seem clear is that most deaths occurred not in Europe but in Africa and Southeast Asia. In the event, most of the vaccine was unused, as it had been bought by the world’s more affluent countries and had often arrived when the epidemic was past its high point. Countries that had not been able to push themselves to the front of the queue
no longer had an interest in purchasing surplus vaccine.
Millions of doses, which would be of no value in combatting a future influenza epidemic (and which some critics claimed had not been properly tested for safety) had to be destroyed.
Fierce debate followed, with critics claiming that the WHO had exaggerated the danger, spreading fear and confusion’ rather than ‘immediate information’. Committees of enquiry were appointed to investigate decision-making at the WHO and national levels.
On what basis, and on whose advice, had the pandemic been declared? On what basis and on whose advice had national health authorities signed secret contracts with multinational vaccine manufacturers?
When it finally became known that many of the most influential advisers, at both WHO and national levels, were paid consultants to the vaccine industry, many commentators were appalled. Whose interests had they been serving? Wasn’t this a clear case of conflict of interests?

How To Ensure India’s Food Security From Coronavirus Outbreak,"Around 60 percent of India’s food supply and farmers incomes are dependent on the Kharif season and March to May is a critical time for preparing Kharif seeds. Seed production is a complex process which needs to be completed before the seed is ready to be sent to the farmers’ fields. With a stressed Rabi season, it’s imperative to ensure speedy delivery of Zaid, Kharif seeds to farmers. Heres how to ensure India’s Food Security from Coronavirus outbreak during the 21-day nationwide lockdown.
EXCLUSIVE: Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It (watch here Visualizing The Secret History Of Coronavirus)

A pandemic is upon us — COVID-19 — and India, more than the world, needs to tread very cautiously if we want to save 1.3 billion Indians from this threat. In the shadows of the coronavirus lies also another threat to India’s food security. Deviating from public consensus, some renowned medical experts confirm that India is “100 percent in the third stage”(community transmission phase) and it is only a matter of days before we get confirmed reports of COVID-19 cases from India’s food zones — villages.
Despite the commendable efforts by the Central and state governments to stop this contagion, the media has already reported a mass exodus from affected cities back to hinterland villages, now who can ascertain, how many of them are carrying the virus? How will this disease affect our food supply and seeds?
Agriculture is the backbone of our survival and most of our agriculture today depends on quality seeds and the organised seed sector. Our food production is also dependent on the availability of human resources or farm labour, farm inputs and free movement of agricultural produce – including seeds. All are restricted at this time.
These limitations bring a new dilemma, who will harvest, process, store and transport Rabi wheat and other crops throughout the nation? If we look at China reports indicate weakened food production and high food price inflation due to COVID-19. Plus there is also a shortage of farm inputs — fertilisers, seeds, etc. which will decrease the food production later this year in China too.
Globally, the US and the European Union have shut their borders. Even within the countries, people are scared to venture out and are especially avoiding crowded places. From Vietnam to the US, schools are closed and the streets are deserted. In Italy, friends have to wait in queues extending up to 2 kilometres to get food. World over the agrarian productivity may take spiral downward. How long before India experiences the same?
Farmers in the northern parts of the country were already reeling by untimely rain, and now they are hit by the coronavirus crisis. Many are fearing that this may break their resilience altogether and affect the Rabi crop, as harvest and post-harvest losses may increase.
Overall, if due to the shutdown farm inputs including seed processing are curtailed, we will go China way too. The current environment already heralds decreased availability of farmhands, rising farm wages and increased cost of foods.
For the seed sector, minimum support price and seed pricing calculations may greatly deviate for this season and small and medium seeds companies along with seed retailers will face the brunt in the Zaid and Kharif season.
This is not all, a larger logistical nightmare still remains, how will India be ready to supply 250 lakh quintals of quality seed for the Kharif season to the farmers? ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) laboratories are shut, and private seed sector restricted, although seeds are included in the list of essential commodities, The Seed Control (Order), 1983 also clarify the same.
Who will produce and distribute quantity seeds for the farmers and how can India meet her Rabi and Kharif targets without good seeds?
Around 60 percent of India’s food supply and farmers incomes are dependent on the Kharif season and March to May is a critical time for preparing Kharif seeds. Seed production is a complex process which needs to be completed before the seed is ready to be sent to the farmers’ fields.
Apart from seed production on the farmers’ fields, the quality control and production supervisory teams are required to monitor the pollination, pre-harvest and harvest operations. Similarly, the quality assurance teams need to conduct inspections, carry grow out test operations as well as laboratory testing.
Finally, all the seeds need to be processed, packed and distributed across the country so that they reach through millions of retailors to the needy farmers who can take up timely sowing of their crop for ensuring continuity of food supplies to the Nation. This is a process that needs adequate time and can in no way be done away with.
Ensuring India’s Food Security
As per the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Bundesinstitut für Risikobewertung (BfR), saying that “there is currently no evidence that food including seed is a likely source or route of transmission of the virus. Transmission via surfaces which have recently been contaminated with the virus is, nonetheless, possible through smear infections. However, this is only likely to occur during a short period after contamination, due to the relatively low stability of coronaviruses in the environment.”
What this means is that there is no evidence yet and seeds may not be a gateway after all. But fear grows faster than corona.
These are frightful times, where we need courage and truth as our lodestar. We need to make informed decisions, so COVID-19 doesn’t evolve to threaten our agriculture and food supply. No governments should impose any restrictions on agrarian products, including seeds. Seeds companies and exporters should take responsibility for the health and safety of workers involved in the shipments.
The staff and workers working in the seed companies may be permitted to move to the extent required for carrying out their job responsibilities. The identity cards issued by the company employing them can be used for ascertaining their identity.
Next measure can be to allow vehicles carrying seeds from farmers’ fields to processing plants, from one processing plant to other processing plant or from a processing plant to the distribution points (C&F agencies) or from distribution points to the retailers may be permitted after due inspection based on the accompanying documents which clarify that they are nothing but seeds or the packing materials, leaflets, treating materials etc., required for packing seeds.
Since the seeds move across states, the intimation will have to be sent to all the states so that the movement of seeds is allowed from state to state without any hindrance. Agro-input retailers may be permitted to sell seeds depending on the sowing season in respective regions/states. For example, the jute sowing has already started in West Bengal.  The cotton sowing may start very soon in Punjab, Haryana etc.
In the end, we all have to come together as one nation to fight this virus. Medical workers, government and essential workers including farmers and seed breeders have a critical role to play in virus proofing India. We have to ensure that our food supplies don’t plummet and India doesn’t descend into a panic like the rest of the world.
Farmers have a very important role, which they cannot enact if good quality seed along with other farm inputs is not made available to them in time. The scarcity of any of these inputs, may lead to declining food production and eventually food inflation and if mismanaged even a famine later this year.

On 24th March, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a complete lockdown for the entire nation over the following 21 days in order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. The past month showed the government that immigration control and social distancing, practised vigorously in countries such as Singapore and Russia, are far more effective in curtailing the spread of the disease than trying to engage medical services and equipment in treating it.
The PM urged citizens to take the order extremely seriously and allocated ₹150 billion towards medical infrastructure and treatment services.

France Launch Innovative Online Coronavirus Assessment Test,"Worried you got COVID-19? Now you can take this innovative Online Coronavirus Assessment Test launched by the French Government.
EXCLUSIVE: Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It (watch here Visualizing The Secret History Of Coronavirus)

France has launched an online test aimed at helping people who are worried they may have contracted the coronavirus to assess their symptoms, and guide them as to what steps to take next.
The test is approved by the French health ministry and went live on Wednesday. It contains 24 questions related to the most common symptoms experienced by people who have developed the COVID-19 illness after being infected with the coronavirus.
Questions range from “have you had a fever in the past few days?” and “what is your temperature?”, to “have you experienced abnormal fatigue?” or “experienced any respiratory problems?”
At the end of the test, which is based on an algorithm tracking the latest scientific discoveries related to the coronavirus and its contraction, users are also asked to answer questions about their weight, height, age, and additional information concerning their general state of health.
They are then advised on whether they should contact a doctor for further consultation, call the emergency services, or whether they appear unlikely to have contracted the virus.
“The test is not a diagnosis, but rather a health assessment so that people know where to turn,” Dr. Fabrice Denis, a member of the newly established Digital Alliance Against COVID-19, which developed the test, told AFP.
In France, like in many other countries, a shortage of physical coronavirus tests means lab tests are conducted only for cases considered serious or if the patient is elderly or part of a specific risk group, such as people with asthma, diabetes, cancer or other ailments.
The online test serves to reassure people who might be worried about cold or flu symptoms, but it was developed, mainly, to help offset the massive pressure that the coronavirus has put on the French health services. It helps “reduce the number of unnecessary phone calls to the emergency medical services, which are already saturated,” Denis said.
On Saturday, more than 2 million people visited the website, of which about 1 million filled out all 24 of questions. Some 12 percent of the test-takers were urged to contact the emergency services. Denis said that the statistics in themselves confirmed the usefulness of the test and the benefit of making it available to the general public.
The test is anonymous, with users only required to submit their postal codes, and the data is sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris for further analysis.
“It allows us to follow the number of patients, department by department, who have declared a cough and fever and a shortness of breath. And it allows us to see whether the numbers decrease over time,” Denis said.
The Digital Alliance Against COVID-19 consists of around 15 private sector players, including the start-up Kelindi, which coordinates the project, as well as the digital arm of the French postal service Groupe La Poste and insurer Allianz France.
Take the test at Maladiecoronavirus.

Finland Says WHO’s Coronavirus Protocol Doesn’t Work,"In a startling disclosure, a senior Finnish health official has dismissed a World Health Organization advisory saying WHO doesn’t understand pandemics and that their Coronavirus testing protocol is illogical and doesn’t work. Finland has 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus but no reported deaths so far.

A senior Finnish health official has dismissed a World Health Organization (WHO) advisory to test as many people as possible for coronavirus, arguing that such a measure would be completely illogical when combating a pandemic. Finland’s head of health security, Mika Salminen, took aim at the notion that stopping the spread of Covid-19 requires testing on a mass-scale.
“We don’t understand the WHO’s instructions for testing. We can’t fully remove the disease from the world anymore,” she said, adding: “If someone claims that, they don’t understand pandemics.”
Citing limited supplies, Finland has narrowed coronavirus testing to high-risk individuals and medical workers. Salminen told local media that screening for the virus should be done where it will be “effective,” not simply “where there is concern” about the respiratory disease.
“Those who may be sick at home do not benefit from testing,” she said.
The Finnish health official noted that administering the test drains valuable medical resources and personnel from those who need it most.
Finland has 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus but no reported deaths, according to a tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
Meanwhile, as the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, a Chinese government-owned think tank is soliciting opinions to gauge how the international community might receive a Chinese alternative to WHO (World Health Organization).
In a message viewed by Axios, CNPC Economics & Technology Research Institute (CNPC ETRI) said they were exploring the possibility of a Beijing-led global health organization that would rival the WHO, asking how Israeli experts at SIGNAL, an Israeli nonprofit dedicated to strengthening Israeli-China ties, would view such an organization.

Coronavirus Triggers Worldwide Cyberattacks
It is a known fact that global cyberattacks are getting more intense day by day. Hackers, hacktivists, cyber threat groups, and state-sponsored cyber organizations are taking advantage at every turn. Sometimes their motivation is economical (ransom requests) and sometimes it is for political and intelligence purposes.
While hackers target their victims with ransomware, state-sponsored organizations target their victims for intelligence gathering and surveillance. The fear and panic environment caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic causes these attacks to be successful.
Hackers and hacker groups that carry out operations with financial motivation demand ransom. State-sponsored APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups infiltrate critical institutions or private systems with the documents they use as lures.
Iran – AC19 App
Iran has developed a mobile app called AC19 for citizens who think they have been infected with Coronavirus to perform their own tests at home. Citizens who report their identity and location information to the authorities through the app can be tested without going to hospitals.
AC19 in the Google Play store has been removed by Google on suspicion of spying, according to ZDNet news. According to allegations, this app collects Iranian citizens’ identity and location information and uses them for spying purposes. After the Iranians who downloaded the app sent this complaint to Google Play, Google removed this app from the store.

According to Recorded Future, Coronavirus pandemic was armed by the Iranian government as a way to spread spyware. The Iranian Ministry of Health sent an SMS to victims recommending that they download a special app to track the potential symptoms of COVID-19. The Android app called “Ac19.apk” containing spyware is downloaded to mobile devices through a website created by the Iranian government.
Iranians say the AC19 app developed for Coronavirus detection is suspect and it is not possible to test a virus using the app. It is also believed that the company, Smart Land Solutions (new name Sarzamin Housmand), which developed the app, has developed suspicious apps for the Iranian regime such as Hotgram and Talagram. These apps were also removed from Google Play. It is also claimed that the company and some of its important employees are related to Iranian intelligence services.
Israel – NSO Group’s Tracking App
As for Israel, the situation is not very different. In order to track the spread of the Coronavirus epidemic, the Israeli government is negotiating to track its citizens’ mobile phones. In addition, there are claims that a software has already been developed. The Israeli technology company NSO Group, which has become popular with its spyware (Pegasus) and surveillance technologies, has developed a new product that is said to have the ability to track the spread of Coronavirus.
#Pegasus was created by Israeli #cyber weapons dealer #NSOGroup whose parent company Francisco Partners also owns #CrossMatch contracted by #UIDAI for #Aadhaar. This was revealed by us already in 2017. Took almost 2 years for Indian media to catchup. #RIPhttps://t.co/N3ADEOxRN6
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) October 31, 2019

According to Bloomberg, the software receives mobile phone tracking information from the infected person for two weeks, which is the incubation period of the virus, and then maps them to location data from the operator. This product of NSO is tested just like Israel’s approval of the use of “an counter terrorism tracking technology” to track the movements of Coronavirus patients and the people they encounter. This practice, a controversial step, raises criticism that the privacy of Israeli citizens will be violated.
China – Mustang & Vicious Panda APT Group
State-supported cyber activities of countries such as China, Russia, North Korea are implemented through APT groups. Attacks targeting states, multinational companies and individuals are usually carried out with a malicious document. The contents of such Coronavirus outbreak related malicious documents are remarkable. Documents sent to the target as baits may contain statement such as “important, urgent, alert”.
Mustang Panda APT Group
One of the attacks detected in this context is the attack of the Chinese Mustang Panda APT group. Mustang Panda attracts people’s attention with an expression such as “The latest situation about the Coronavirus incident in your city and the security measures to be taken” regarding the APT group Coronavirus.
Vicious Panda APT Group
Another Chinese-origin attack that is thought to have been caused by APT targeted Mongolia. According to the Check Point study, the Vicious Panda APT group, which is considered to be state-sponsored in China, targeted Mongolian government officials by imitating e-mails from the Mongolian Foreign Ministry. As a result of the analysis of RTF documents written in Mongolian language, malicious activity was detected. The APT group, which attacks various states and organizations around the world, takes advantage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The main purpose of the Vicious Panda group remains the mystery and this threat actor is constantly updating their attack tools.
Russia – Hades APT Group
Another Coronavirus-themed APT attack is known to originate from Russia. The cyber threat group called Hades APT (thought to be linked to APT28) is targeting Ukraine. According to the findings of RedDrip Team, the malicious document imitated as sent from the Ministry of Health Public Health Center of Ukraine opens the back door in the system by triggering the macro code. Researchers believe that a Word document containing malware named COVID-19 was triggered by remote code execution (RCE).

North Korea – BabyShark APT Group
North Korea, which is one of the prominent countries in global ransomware and data theft, also seems to have exploited the Coronavirus outbreak. A Word document identified by a cyber threat investigator named IssueMakersLab is allegedly armed by a North Korean origin BabyShark APT group. The document targeting South Koreans was imitated as if it contained information about South Korea’s reactions and responsibilities against the COVID-19 outbreak.

Pakistan – APT36 Group
A different actor has recently been added to similar threat actors. RedDrip Team researchers reported that the Pakistani APT36 threat group is using a trap health advisory to spread malware containing a Remote Administration Tool (RAT). According to Malwarebytes researchers, APT36 used a spear-phishing email with a link to a malicious document that seemed to have been prepared from the Indian government in the Coronavirus-themed cyber attack. The malicious document has two hidden macros that drop a RAT variant called Crimson RAT.

The APT36 threat group is believed to target embassies and the Indian government as a state-sponsored actor in Pakistan. APT36, which is thought to act according to Pakistan’s military and diplomatic interests, is reported to have carried out cyber espionage operations to collect sensitive information from India. APT36 group is also known as Transparent Tribe, ProjectM, Mythic Leopard and TEMP.Lapis.
Coronavirus-Themed Phishing and Scam Activities
Japanese speakers targeted with AZORult Malware
In addition to state-sponsored cyber threat actors and APT groups, hackers and hacker groups exploit the global Coronavirus panic. In February, cyber attackers took advantage of targets’ Coronavirus fears by sending malicious health information emails to Japanese speakers. According to Proofpoint researchers, these Coronavirus-themed attacks target many industries, including almost all manufacturing, industry, finance, transportation, pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies. Accordingly, this specific Coronavirus-themed e-mail campaign has Microsoft Word documents containing malware and installs AZORult, known as a malware that steals information, using a two and a half year vulnerability. The actors behind this campaign are thought to be of Russian and Eastern European origin.
Malicious links disguised as official CDC & WHO
Another global phishing attack that occurred in March was detected by Cofense. The detected emails mimic as if they came from The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and seem to show the spread of Coronavirus and the current outbreak situation. In addition to this attack campaign, Cofense Intelligence Agent detected a phishing campaign mimicking the World Health Organization (WHO) to deliver the Tesla keylogger. The phishing campaign is designed to arouse fear and curiosity about Coronavirus.
Trickbot spam campaign targeting Italians
Another phishing attack detected by the Sophos company takes place with the Word document targeting the Italians and containing malicious macros. According to Sophos, the actors of the Trickbot spam campaign caused from panic, anxiety and fears that spread across the country after the Coronavirus outbreak in Italy, with spam emails targeting Italian email addresses. Sophos also detected other e-mail campaigns different than malware that produced the same spam e-mails dating back to September of last year. The latest detected attack worries victims about COVID-19 and tries to mobilize them.
TEMP.Armageddon targets Asia
Another campaign using the Coronavirus outbreak and exploiting victims’ emotions was spotted by FireEye. According to Forbes news, a group of Chinese hackers suspected that in late February and early March, malicious documents were sent to targets in Vietnam, Philippines and Taiwan. The documents included recommendations for Coronavirus from official sources, but there were spyware hidden in the documents, and they were stealing data. FireEye also reported that the espionage group named TEMP.Armageddon, which is thought to be of Russian origin, sent Ukrainians a phishing email containing a malicious, Coronavirus-themed document.
CovidLock – Malicious Coronavirus Tracker App with Ransomware
In addition to malicious software, cyber threat actors also use websites and apps that contain malicious content in Coronavirus-themed campaigns. In this context, the security and research team from DomainTools has discovered a website that claims to have a real-time Coronavirus outbreak tracer with a mobile app. The application named “Covid19 Tracker App” actually contains ransomware. This Android ransomware, which was discovered for the first time, was named “CovidLock” because of the malware’s capabilities and background story. CovidLock uses techniques to deny access to the victim’s phone by forcing the password used to unlock the phone. When the phone is locked, a ransom note appears on the screen, and the attackers demand $100 ransom to unlock it.

In addition to these campaigns, it is determined that websites containing malicious content are on the rise. Many of the hundreds of Coronavirus-themed domains are known to infect malware or redirect to different content. Some actors, including cybercriminals, operate on such sites for their own benefit. In order to combat Coronavirus, sales of products such as masks, gloves, disinfectants are also illegally seen on these sites.
Coronavirus Panic attracts Cyber ​​Threat Actors
The Coronavirus outbreak, which has been going on for about three months, has created an atmosphere of panic and fear all over the world. Cyber ​​criminals and threat actors also want to use this environment of fear and panic for their own benefit. They use their own best-known methods for this.
Malicious websites, apps, documents and e-mail campaigns for phishing purposes are the most used cyber attack methods by cyber threat actors. These global campaigns are detected and reported in various countries. It is predicted that such attacks will increase in the coming days.
It is believed that especially cybercriminals with economic motivation and state-sponsored cyber threat actors operating for cyber espionage will continue their activities during the Coronavirus outbreak. It is estimated that victims will be increasingly targeted with Coronavirus-themed activities, apps, websites and armed documents.

First Dog Dies Of Coronavirus In Hong Kong,"First dog found with Coronavirus has died after returning home virus-free from quarantine, Hong Kong authorities reveal. The 17-year-old Pomeranian, which belonged to a Covid-19 patient, had been quarantined at a government facility since February 26, and returned home on Saturday. Owner said she was not willing to allow an autopsy to determine cause of death, according to Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department.

The first dog in the world to be found with the new coronavirus died on Monday after testing negative for the disease and returning home, according to Hong Kong’s animal welfare authority.
The 17-year-old Pomeranian, which belonged to a now-recovered Covid-19 patient, had been under mandatory quarantine at a government facility since February 26, and returned home last Saturday.
A spokesman for the city’s Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said: “The department learned from the dog’s owner that it had passed away on March 16. The owner said she was not willing to [allow] an autopsy to examine the cause of death.”
The dog had repeatedly been tested during its quarantine. A total of five tests from its nasal and oral samples all returned “weak positive” results for the virus.

It was not until the two tests – carried out on March 12 and 13 – proved the dog’s samples were negative that the department allowed it to leave the centre and return home.
The owner, a 60-year-old woman, was confirmed to be infected and hospitalised on February 25. She recovered and returned home on March 8. Some of the woman’s close contacts were also confirmed with the coronavirus.
Serology tests, which look for antibodies in the blood, were carried out on the dog from March 3 and came back negative on March 12, meaning no antibodies specific to the coronavirus were found in its system.
At the time, an AFCD statement said the negative serological test result did not suggest the dog had not been infected with the virus.
“It is known in some asymptomatic or mild cases of human infections with other types of coronavirus that antibodies may not always develop,” it said.
The department said earlier the genetic make-up of the virus found in the dog and its human contacts were very similar.
“The [gene] sequence results indicate that the virus likely spread from the infected persons and subsequently infected the dog,” it said in a statement.
The department stressed there was currently no evidence that pet animals could be a source of infection or that they could become sick.
It added that aside from maintaining good hygiene practices, pet owners need not be overly concerned and under no circumstances should they abandon their pets.
So far, four pets – a cat and three dogs – have been placed at the animal keeping facility at the Hong Kong Port of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.
Apart from the Pomeranian, the other three animals – an exotic shorthair cat, a Shiba Inu and a mongrel – tested negative for the deadly virus.

The Saudi SARS Sample
On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke.
The Canadian Lab
On May 4, 2013, a sample of this Saudi SARS (aka novel Coronavirus) from the very first infected Saudi patient arrived in Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg via Ron Fouchier of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands who sequenced the virus sample.
Chinese Biological Espionage
In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China.
Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian lab – the only level-4 facility equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases where Coronavirus sample from the first Saudi patient was being examined.
Xiangguo Qiu
The scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu.
Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist Dr. Keding Cheng – the couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents posing as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program.
Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips to the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the outbreak.
The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.
Frank Plummer Assassination
Meanwhile, in a very strange turn of events, renowned scientist Frank Plummer who received Saudi SARS Coronavirus sample and was working on Coronavirus (HIV) vaccine in the Winnipeg based Canadian lab from where the virus was smuggled by Chinese Biowarfare agents has died in mysterious conditions in Nairobi, Kenya.
Scholars or Spies
The Thousand Talents Plan or Thousand Talents Program was established in 2008 by the central government of China to recognize and recruit leading international experts in scientific research, innovation, and entrepreneurship – in other words to steal western technology.
Weaponizing Biotech
China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge. Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”

Coronavirus Cases Maybe 10 Times Higher Than Reported,"Observations from the Johns Hopkins University real-time tracking dashboard indicate that Coronavirus cases maybe 10 times higher than reported. In response to the ongoing public health emergency, Johns Hopkins University developed an interactive web-based dashboard hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, to visualize and track reported Coronavirus cases in real-time.

Among the serious observations available in a post under the heading “Public Health” dated January 31, 2020 from Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering are two significant claims that still stand entirely neglected in media treatment:
(1) That official China novel Coronavirus statistics were at least at that writing nearly six weeks ago only reflective of 10% of actually occurring cases; that is, that the figures issuing from China should be considered depressed by 90% by whatever semantics one allows to indulge China’s self-exculpatory pretense of obliviousness in statistic-gathering and/or reporting strategies, and
(2) That novel Coronavirus infections already had numbered in the hundreds at least in Wuhan as of November 2019.
One may note in this regard that collation of Coronavirus COVID-19 cases on the Johns Hopkins real-time dashboard indicates both The World Health Organization and United States Center for Disease Control as figuring among its contributing data sources.
Altogether, the foregoing presents a peculiar disparity of figures and posturing. On the one hand, following the first point above, it is suggested conversely that even at least as of January 31, 2020, cases of novel Coronavirus in Mainland China should be calculated at ten times the reported number; from which to present at least a ten-fold assumption would hold because currently reported decreases in cases at this writing would be speciously based on modeling from the 90% under-reporting that it is reasonable to impute in large measure to WHO and CDC as significant source base for Johns Hopkins, which wisely indicates the disparity for consideration.
Then, considering the second point, assuming hundreds of cases extant already in Wuhan as of any time in November, 2019, there could be no possible way to accept China’s initial figures at all. Johns Hopkins politely states the case for us and it may perhaps be perilous to neglect this intended or unintended favor hiding in plain sight.

Companies Infecting Humans With Coronavirus For Clinical Trials,"In a $2 billion race to find a vaccine various companies are infecting humans with Coronavirus for clinical trials. A medical research firm based in the U.K. is offering more than $4,500 to individuals willing to serve as guinea pigs and be injected with two strains of Coronavirus similar to COVID-19 in a bid to find a vaccine for the new deadly virus. In the U.S., another firm is seeking participants for a COVID-19 vaccine study, but the pay is not as high, nor as quick, nor as risky.

Human Lab Rats Needed
The offer comes from London-based company Hvivo, which is seeking 24 healthy individuals at a time to receive the weaker shots of Coronavirus before being administered vaccines in what the Times of London described as “a $2 billion race to find a vaccine” for COVID-19.
According to the New York Post, participants would make around $4,588 to participate in Hvivo’s “flu camp,” which entails a two-week quarantine where they must “eat a restricted diet and avoid human contact and exercise.”
The firm is still awaiting approval from the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency before trials can begin — but even if it gets clearance quickly, a cure is not expected until next winter, despite more than 20 firms participating in the race to find a shot to prevent the virus that has already taken nearly 4,000 lives globally.
In the U.S., another firm is seeking participants for a COVID-19 vaccine study, but the pay is not as high, nor as quick, nor as risky.
Business Insider reported that Seattle’s Kaiser Permanente Washington research clinic plans to enroll 45 healthy folks to participate in a 14-month trial to test three doses of a potential vaccine against the novel Coronavirus for safety.
However, in the Seattle study, participants would not be injected with the Coronavirus. The researchers are offering $100 per visit for volunteers to show up in person 11 times, offering a total payout of $1,100 for those willing to serve as guinea pigs to test out the safety of what could be a life-saving vaccine.

Making Millions from Coronavirus
While the outbreak has claimed more than 3000 lives officially, this small elite group made millions from Coronavirus, courtesy of their association with the biotechs working on Coronavirus vaccine development programs.
The $35 billion vaccine market is dominated by GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi Adventis, Merck and Pfizer. These 4 players represent 85% of the vaccine market. These are the primary players but are by no means alone because there is a global rush out there.
Three biotech stocks are surging on the possibility of coronavirus drugs and minting millions of dollars for their biggest shareholders. Gilead, Moderna, and Novavax have all outperformed the falling stock market in recent days as the three drug developers rush to introduce preventative vaccines and treatments.

Chinese Alternative To WHO,"As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, a Chinese government-owned think tank is soliciting opinions to gauge how the international community might receive a Chinese alternative to WHO (World Health Organization).

Why it matters: Beijing is seeking to turn the coronavirus, initially a disaster for China’s public image, into an opportunity to advance its global leadership and bolster its soft power abroad.
In a message viewed by Axios, an employee of CNPC Economics & Technology Research Institute (CNPC ETRI) said they were exploring the possibility of a Beijing-led global health organization that would rival the WHO.
The employee then asked how Israeli experts at SIGNAL, an Israeli nonprofit dedicated to strengthening Israeli-China ties, would view such an organization.
CNPC ETRI is a think tank affiliated with the China National Petroleum Corporation, which is owned by the Chinese government. The president of CNPC ETRI reports to Chinese leadership. (The institute did not respond to a request for comment.)
Context: China is seeking to recast itself as a global leader in the fight against the coronavirus, rather than the country where it originated and spread due to the government’s initial suppression of information related to the outbreak.
What they’re saying: “According to our analysis, the situation of coronavirus around the world is urgent, therefore, we consider that perhaps the world needs a leadership country/organization coordinating all the countries affected in fighting against coronavirus, just like the leadership role of U.S. in W.H.O,” wrote the think tank employee.
The think tank employee then asked for feedback on the idea and whether SIGNAL’s experts agreed with it.

Between the lines: In China, state-sponsored think tanks can double as diplomatic back channels, allowing leaders a low-risk means to float new ideas and explore how they might be perceived.
Carice Witte, the founder and executive director of SIGNAL, told Axios the idea of a Beijing-led WHO alternative is “very interesting in the context of China’s aim to reshape global governance, including setting up parallel institutions.”
“Our research purpose is to predict the development of coronavirus around the word and how to fight against the epidemics. We also asked experts other questions such as the public response to the crisis and how does the public view the measures taken by the government to fight against coronavirus.” said Sun Li, a research fellow at CNPC ETRI.
“The question is nothing more than a survey which is used to predict coronavirus development.”

Anming Hu – Chinese Spy Caught At University Of Tennessee
Beginning in 2016, Hu engaged in a scheme to defraud the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) by concealing his affiliation with Beijing University of Technology (BJUT) in China. Federal law prohibits NASA from using federally appropriated funds on projects in collaboration with China or Chinese universities. As alleged in the indictment, Hu’s false representations and omissions to UTK about his affiliation with BJUT caused UTK to falsely certify to NASA that UTK was in compliance with federal law.
“Hu allegedly committed fraud by hiding his relationship with a Chinese university while receiving funding from NASA,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers.  “This is just the latest case involving professors or researchers concealing their affiliations with China from their American employers and the U.S. government.  We will not tolerate it.” 
“The FBI and its federal government, private-sector, and academic partners will continue to investigate and collaborate to counter these efforts at concealment, wherever they occur,” said FBI Special-Agent-in-Charge Joseph E. Carrico.
If convicted, Hu faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a fine up to $250,000 on each of the wire fraud counts, and up to five years in prison on each of the false statement counts.
Chinese Biowarfare Agents At Harvard University Caught Smuggling Viruses
The Tennessee case follows another espionage case last month where Chinese Biowarfare agents at Harvard University were caught smuggling viruses. The Chair of Harvard University’s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department and two Chinese nationals were charged in connection with aiding the People’s Republic of China.
Dr. Charles Lieber, 60, Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, was arrested and charged by criminal complaint with one count of making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement.
Yanqing Ye, 29, a Chinese national, was charged in an indictment with one count each of visa fraud, making false statements, acting as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy. Ye is currently in China.
Zaosong Zheng, 30, a Chinese national, was arrested on Dec. 10, 2019, at Boston’s Logan International Airport and charged by criminal complaint with attempting to smuggle 21 vials of biological research to China. On Jan. 21, 2020, Zheng was indicted on one count of smuggling goods from the United States and one count of making false, fictitious or fraudulent statements.  He has been detained since Dec. 30, 2019.
Curious case of Chinese Biological Espionage at the Canadian lab
Similar case of Chinese Biological Espionage was busted at Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory prompting a full-fledged investigation along with the dismissal of Chinese agents. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to China’s Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.

Curiously unlike the American investigation, Canadian authorities have been tight-lipped about the whole incident with details about the case still not fully revealed.
Scholars or Spies
China’s drives to recruit scholars and technology experts are a primary channel for harvesting foreign technologies and intellectual property, stated a June 2018 White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy document.
At an April 2018 hearing titled “Scholars or Spies”, organized by two subcommittees of the US House of Representatives, the commissioner of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Michael Wessel, advised Congress to cut federal grants, loans or other assistance to participants of the Thousand Talents Plan. China has put “sleeper agents at our research universities to steal our scientific breakthroughs,” said Representative Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, at the hearing.

How A Harvard Professor Made $400 Million From Coronavirus Vaccine,"Earlier than Moderna Inc. launched one of many greatest preliminary public choices in biotechnology historical past, one in all its earliest traders was giving a lecture about rocks. Timothy Springer invested $5 million within the startup’s early days. His windfall is one in a sequence of savvy investments. Heres how this Harvard professor made $400 million from Coronavirus vaccine development.

Timothy Springer, a professor of medication at Harvard Medical College, is a collector of gongshi, or students’ rocks, from China. As Moderna executives ready for the corporate’s much-anticipated stock-market debut, the unassuming educational spoke on the Boston Sculptors Gallery about his seek for the fantastically formed stones which have impressed poets and artists for hundreds of years.
“The best way he’s desirous about stones, it’s the identical approach he’s desirous about his work,” mentioned Kemin Hu, one of many world’s foremost specialists on the stones. Springer is one in all her college students. “When he loves one thing, he needs to do one thing. For science you want this type of spirit.”
Springer is the fourth-largest shareholder of Moderna, which hopes to make customized most cancers vaccines. He’s invested $5 million and now owns 17.three million shares, which on the IPO worth of $23 a share have been valued at roughly $400 million. Even after Moderna inventory sank by almost 20 % on their first day of buying and selling, his stake was price $320 million.
Moderna wasn’t Springer’s first windfall. He is change into one of many wealthiest lecturers within the U.S., having made about $100 million when his first enterprise, a drugmaker referred to as LeukoSite, was purchased by Millennium Prescribed drugs in 1999. Since then, he has change into a prolific backer of younger biotechnology firms.
Regardless of his increasing wealth, Springer retains the mien of the researcher. He wears denims, bikes to work and socializes with different lecturers. He spends extra time with fleece-clad scientists than Ferragamo-shod bankers.
“I’ve an educational way of life,” Springer mentioned in an interview. “I’m not into ramen noodles, however my associates are lecturers, so it doesn’t actually behoove me to be flashy.”
His few indulgences embody a modernist house in Boston’s upscale Chestnut Hill neighborhood, the place Springer, 70, devotes his surplus vitality to preserving a prolific backyard.
“We don’t have a second house,” he mentioned. “If we go away in the summertime, we will’t harvest the greens.”

Springer got here to spend money on Moderna by happenstance. In 2010, his Harvard colleague Derrick Rossi requested for recommendation on getting enterprise capitalists desirous about his thought to make use of messenger RNA to remodel stem cells for the remedy of illness. Rossi was having bother discovering funding and knew of Springer’s success with LeukoSite.
“They trotted it out to some enterprise capitalists and nobody wished it,” Springer mentioned. “He was my school colleague and so he got here to me and I favored it and I put some cash into it. I mentioned in case you like I can introduce you to another individuals.”
These individuals included celebrated Massachusetts Institute of Know-how chemical-engineering professor Robert Langer and Flagship Pioneering, a Cambridge, Massachusetts, agency that incubates and launches life-science firms. Moderna was born.
Springer’s funding in Moderna additionally launched him as a notable backer of medical startups. He is put his personal cash into firms comparable to Editas Drugs Inc., Selecta Biosciences Inc. and Morphic Therapeutics, which he helped discovered.
One other of Springer’s ventures referred to as Scholar Rock Holding Co. — a nod to his ardour for the ornately formed stones — went public this yr amid a wider surge in biotech IPOs. Since their Could debut, the shares have risen greater than 90 %.
From December 2008 by means of this November, Springer estimates that his inner price of return is about 57 %. He typically serves on the boards or scientific advisory committees of firms he’s backed.
Springer mentioned investing is “a approach of reaching issues. There’s sure metrics you possibly can obtain in academia, you possibly can win prizes, you possibly can have a number of citations to your publications. There’s very clear metrics in investing.”
“Being profitable is one thing that individuals want to do and it isn’t straightforward to do,” he mentioned.
“I’m not into ramen noodles, however my associates are lecturers, so it doesn’t actually behoove me to be flashy.”
His accumulating positive aspects have allowed Springer to pursue bigger objectives. With $25 million of his personal cash, he based a nonprofit referred to as the Institute for Protein Innovation dedicated to discovering more practical antibodies. Previous analysis in that space has helped to search out blockbuster drugs together with AbbVie Inc.’s Humira, the best-selling drug on this planet.
Springer says he’ll give away a few of the institute’s discoveries without spending a dime. A part of its mission is to develop an open-source library of identified antibodies, constructing a sort of protein recipe e-book to assist researchers conduct primary science that drug firms, that are targeted on extra near-term horizons, will not bankroll.
“I really feel that I’ve had greater than sufficient wealth for myself for a while,” Springer mentioned. “I don’t really feel I would like extra.”

The firm submitted vials of mRNA-1273 to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for a phase one study in the US, according to a press release. Moderna is the first company to push a preventative vaccine for the outbreak to trial.
The company was able to deliver the first batch just 42 days after identifying the key RNA sequence to target, Juan Andres, chief technical operations and quality officer, said. Andres attributed the quick turnaround to collaboration between Moderna, NIAID, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
The Monday announcement arrived as President Trump called on Congress to approve $2.5 billion in funding for coronavirus vaccines, treatment, and preventative supplies. The US is host to 53 coronavirus cases, though the Centers for Disease Control still considers virus risk in the country to be relatively low.

Moderna’s spike arrives one day after biotech firm Gilead posted a similar gain. The company soared as much as 11% on Monday after a World Health Organization official said its remdesivir compound may be the best bet at treating coronavirus. Gilead’s drug is undergoing human trials in Beijing, with results expected in April. Remdesivir aims to treat the virus, while Moderna’s vaccine would prevent individuals from contracting it.
Coronavirus is responsible for more than 2,700 deaths and has infected more than 80,000 people as of Tuesday morning. The disease broke out in Wuhan, China before spreading throughout the country. New outbreaks in Iran, Italy, and South Korea ratcheted up fears of the outbreak becoming a fatal pandemic.

The coronavirus outbreak is bringing attention to the fast-growing vaccine industry.
The vaccine market has grown sixfold over the past two decades, worth more than $35 billion today, according to AB Bernstein. The firm said the industry has consolidated to four big players that account for about 85% of the market — British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, and U.S.-based Merck and Pfizer.
“For every dollar invested in vaccination in the world’s 94 lowest-income countries, the net return is $44. Hard to argue against,” Wimal Kapadia, Bernstein’s analyst, said in a note. “This oligopoly has been built through significant market consolidation driven primarily by the complexities of the manufacturing and supply chain.”
These companies have jumped into the race to combat the deadly coronavirus, working on vaccine or drug programs. Investors have been flocking to some biotech names amid market volatility in hopes that their initiatives to develop treatment and prevention for the coronavirus could come to fruition at some point.
Sanofi is teaming up with the U.S. government to develop a vaccine for the new virus, hoping its work on the 2003 SARS outbreak could speed up the process. GlaxoSmithKline said this month it is partnering with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations for a vaccine program.

Still, any commercial treatment for the coronavirus could be years away. Experts have warned despite recent advances, the public shouldn’t expect a coronavirus vaccine to hit the market until early next year.
The Bernstein analyst said Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline both have a stable vaccine portfolio, including shingles, flu, pertussis and polio vaccines, that will keep driving revenue.
‘Long-lived assets’
Merck’s vaccine business generated $8.4 billion of revenues in 2019, the segment has been growing at an annual rate of 9% since 2010, according to Bernstein.
Its human papillomavirus vaccine Gardasil 9 will be “the biggest selling vaccine of all time,” Kapadia said. “Gardasil 9 will take over the HPV market given competition is limited – supply is the only decelerator.”
For Pfizer, while its vaccine business has stagnated in recent years, its pipeline has “blockbuster potential,” the analyst noted.
“Vaccines are long-lived assets, have high barriers to entry, typically stable/growing pricing, mostly limited competition and no patent cliff,” Kapadia said.
To be sure, while vaccine companies can see periods of high growth, real innovation is needed to be long-standing winners in a market that requires major capital and faces cheaper alternatives from emerging markets, the analyst cautioned.

The Race for Coronavirus Vaccine
Antiretrovirals drugs can reduce the viral load of the disease. A recent announcement by the World Health Organization (WHO) indicated that Gilead is the front runner in Coronavirus vaccine development with Remdesivir but experts have raised concerns whether Gilead’s Remdesivir can treat Coronavirus? 
Monoclonal antibodies represent another approach and Regeneron has indicated they are weeks away from announcing their target antibodies identified by using their VelocImmune mice used to screen for the viruses antibodies.
However, the most novel way to treat the disease comes from CytoDyn’s researchers, who in a cancer trial have demonstrated how to control the trafficking of suppressor cells that instigate an inflammatory cycle that in some cases is more destructive than the initial viral infection.
CytoDyn’s lead candidate leronlimab, filed for Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and anticipates an FDA decision by March 10th.  The interim results of the trial showed a stoppage of metastasis and the tumor shrinkage was linked to a halt of the CD4 suppressor cells to the tumor.

Strong evidence from leading virologists suggests that controlling the cytokine storm which is a result of the trafficking immune cells could make a profound difference in the treatment of the disease.  If these theories pan out in soon to start clinical trials, a potent COVID-19 treatment could emerge.
Biotechs working on Coronavirus Vaccine
The $35 billion vaccine market is dominated by GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi Adventis, Merck and Pfizer. These 4 players represent 85% of the vaccine market. These are the primary players but are by no means alone because there is a global rush out there. Here are some companies making news in COVID-19.
Moderna
Moderna made news news recently when it announced that Moderna’s experimental vaccine was ready for human testing with mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and mRNA-1273 been shipped to U.S. governmental researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The company anticipates the vaccine’s first clinical trial could start in April. Assuming the April start early-stage trial results could be available in August.  The company has approximately 10 indications in phase 1/2 clinical trials.
Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc
Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc partnered with Beijing Advaccine Biotechnology Co. to advance the development of INO-4800 which is their version of the vaccine to target COVID-19.  Through their partner they hope to quickly advance the vaccine through Chinese clinical trials. They are also developing a vaccine to treat the MERS strain of coronavirus. The company is also developing a phase 3 candidate for cervical HSIL using its compound VGX-3100.
Vaxart Inc
Vaxart Inc has a core competency in oral recombinant protein vaccines but is expanding indications to work on a possible vaccine against Covid-19. Since the vaccine is in the form of a tablet it lends itself to much wider adoption should it be approved. Studies have shown that it is just as effective as the seasonal vaccine Fluzone manufactured by Sanofi Adventis. The market cap is only $80 million so any positive approval news could vault the stock price.
Novavax Inc
Novavax Inc has a proprietary nanoparticle technology that uses different antigens to give the patient better immune response. This broader response could result in a superior vaccine that a level of adaptability built into the vaccine. The company quickly developed a COVID-19 vaccine candidate and has a track record of success in vaccine development especially for the MERS and SARS strains.
Standard approaches to stopping Viral Infections
In an online interview Dr Mark Denison, a virologist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine said “there are two basic approaches to stopping viral infections. One is to block an enzyme the virus needs to survive…so protease, polymerase, exonuclease, endonuclease, cap inhibitors, you name it, right? So we want to find things that target every function. A second approach is to give people drugs made from antibodies know to stop a particular virus.”
Many of these approaches were used during the HIV epidemic that resulted in Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART). The legacy of HAART resulted in a basketful of drugs to treat the disease. Many may not realize but there are 5 classes of drugs and over 40 drugs or combinations approved for HIV today. Many of the HIV drugs target these viral enzymes and are probably worthy of research and like HIV the therapy may be a combination of therapies designed to the virus on multiple fronts.
Denison concluded the interview by saying “if we understood ways the coronavirus has caused lung disease, we might be able to block that damage while we’re treating the virus.” The recent Washington Post article, How the coronavirus can kill people, echoed Denison’s sentiment and addressed in detail the factors that cause the lung damage. This represents a third possible approach.
Anti-Retrovirals
The WHO has openly endorsed Gilead for its remdesivir drug. Earlier in the outbreak China’s Health Commission recommended use of HIV drug Kaletra manufactured by AbbVie (ABBV).
NanoViricides has been very actively traded since it announced it was working on a treatment for COVID-19. The company has a platform technology that is designed to bind to the virus and then eventually encapsulates the virus which ultimately leads to its destruction.
Crocrystal is another stock moving which announced a licensing agreement with Kansas State University for COVID-19 using their technology to identify target enzymes needed for viral replication. The company is in their preclinical phase.
Monoclonal Antibodies
During the Ebola outbreak Regeneron was able to demonstrate a superior standard of care with their REGN-EB3 drug. They demonstrated a 90% survival rate on Ebola patients that receive treatment early. They used a technique that utilized its VelociSuite technologies to figure out a combination of 3 monoclonal antibodies. Regeneron’s plan is to use the same technique to develop a coronavirus drug candidate.
As part of the VelociSuite technology the company “humanized” their mice. When these mice are exposed to a disease like COVID-19 their immune system ends up making human antibodies to fight the disease. These antibodies can be captured and tested as therapeutics.
Regeneron’s Christos Kyratsous, Vice president of research for infectious diseases and viral vector technologies said, “They are basically making fully human antibodies. We’ve created a mini-human immune response in a mouse. And the mice are mounting an immune response against these components as we speak. So within the next few weeks, we should be able to start harvesting antibodies out of these mice and testing them in vitro assets (ph).” It appears that Regeneron is still in the race and should be closely watch for developments in the near future.
Vir Biotechnology is moving rapidly in the fight against COVID-19. They recently identified 2 antibodies that bind to the spike protein using the same process that they used to isolate mAb114 during the Ebola outbreak. VIR has a library of 20 human antibodies that neutralize related coronaviruses. They just announced a collaboration with WuXi Biologics to develop the cell-line and work on regulatory approval in China. It’s important to point out that finding a target doesn’t always result a therapeutic that works.
Stopping Lung Damage
The Washington Post article really highlighted a novel approach. To many that have been infected with COVID-19 it is tantamount to a bad cold, but to others it becomes a fight for their life. The key to the severity of the disease is based on the individual’s immune response. In the article Matthew Friedman, a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine said “What you get is the initial damage and rush of inflammatory cells, but the damage is so extensive that the body’s immune response is completely overwhelmed — which causes even more immune response, more immune cells and more damage.”  He is referring to the trafficking of suppressor cells to the lungs.
CytoSorbents
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a consequence of the damage the virus inflicts on the patients lungs. A ventilator is the primary treatment option that forces the body to absorb some of the fluid in the lungs so that there is a better oxygen transfer. The leader in this field of therapy is CytoSorbents which just recently announced an agreement with China Medical System Holdings Limited to bring CytoSorb to China to treat the critically-ill COVID-19 patients.
The cooperative agreement hopes to achieve regulatory approval under China’s “fast track” program established by the National Medical Products Administration of the People’s Republic of China (NMPA). CtyoSorb is essentially a specialized filter used in conjunction with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO procedures use a heart lung machine that takes blood out of a vein and then oxygenates and removes CO2 only to return it to the artery. This procedure is a last resort that not only provides oxygen to the oxygen deprived organs in the body, but also filters the virus and inflammatory cytokines from the blood. This procedure worked on the SARS and MERS outbreaks and is destined to work on COVID-19.
CtyoSorb is a great concept however in mass casualty situations that currently exist in Wuhan China, this may not be a realistic treatment for the masses.
Bioxytran Inc
Just recently Bioxytran Inc announced it was seeking to partner with a drug company to treat COVID-19 using its lead compound BXT-25. Bioxytran is developing an oxygen transport molecule that is 5000 times smaller than a red blood cell. It’s molecule is based off of Hemopure which is an FDA approved blood substitute for veterinary use. The drug is thought to be safe and is designed to get rid of the Nitric Oxygen scavenging which effected the approval trajectory of Hemopure. The drug is a product of over 30 years and $500 million of drug development.
As an oxygen carrier it can treat literally any disease including ARDS and stroke. In ARDS the theoretical mechanism is that BXT-25 would be part of the blood plasma that leaks out into the lungs getting much closer to the air so that it is able to capture the oxygen and recirculate it. Unless they are able to get a quick approval and funding this preclinical asset may be too late to join the fight regardless of the vastness of their platform technology to deliver oxygen without a hypobaric chamber.
Fusion inhibitors would be the ideal way to treat the disease because it would simply keep the virus outside the target cells. This is exactly what CytoDyn’s drug leronlimab does in HIV. It blocks the CCR5 Co-receptor. After the SARS outbreak there was a lot of research that found viable targets but then became ignored because the virus disappeared. The fact remains that one of those targets is cell surface vimentim. In a 2016 journal article titled Surface vimentin is critical for the cell entry of SARS-CoV the mechanism is elucidated.
Nascent Biotech Inc
The only company with a target for vimentim is Nascent Biotech Inc. Their lead candidate is pritumumab which was a phase 2 brain cancer asset in Japan. They have redone their cell line for study and on the cusp of starting their phase 1 cancer trial.
The Cytokine Storm
In COVID-19 viral loads are ultimately not the killing factor. In reality the human immune system does a great job of controlling the virus but once the adaptive immune system kicks this is the tipping point where intervention could be the key in treating the disease.
CytoDyn’s diagnostic partner Bruce Patterson said in a press release “Leronlimab has both the potential to enhance the cellular immune response by suppressing Treg cells that, in turn, inhibit the anti-viral T-cell responses and the potential to repolarize macrophage activity. Lung (alveolar) macrophages in coronavirus infections have been implicated as a contributing factor to significant morbidity and mortality of the infectious disease. Leronlimab could potentially synergize with other retroviral therapies that are currently being used for the potential treatment of 2019-nCoV.”
The bottom line of the scientific jargon is that leronlimab has the potential to stop the trafficking of cells. This will prevent the immune system from spinning out of control which ultimately results in the downfall of the patient.
Vaccines take time to develop and require extensive testing to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Companies which have tailored therapies to end stage patients have a limited patient population, but have the ability to charge a lot if their efficacy comes through as expected. Understanding the underlying mechanism of action is the key to predicting this outcome. Doctors know that a shot of lidocaine in the hand will also work in the toe because of the underlying mechanism of action of the drug. The science fits and throttling the suppressive response of the immune system seems to be the best theory to fight the disease. There is no magic bullet to treat COVID-19 yet even though some ideal targets have been identified like cell surface vimentim.

Washington Pledges $1 Billion For Coronavirus Vaccine,"U.S. President Donald Trump will seek $2.5 billion from Congress to fight the coronavirus epidemic and U.S. and South Korean militaries are considering scaling back joint training as the virus spreads in Europe and the Middle East.
Countries around the world are stepping up efforts to prevent a pandemic of the flu-like virus that originated from China late last year and has now infected more than 80,000 people, 10 times more cases than the SARS coronavirus.
The White House said more than $1 billion of the requested virus budget would go toward developing a vaccine, while other funds would be used for therapeutics and the stockpiling of personal protective equipment such as masks.

The U.S. and South Korean militaries said on Monday they may cut back joint training due to mounting concerns about the spreading coronavirus, in one of the first concrete signs of the virus’s fallout on global U.S. military activities.
The disclosure came during a visit to the Pentagon by South Korean Defense Minister Jeong Kyeong-doo, who acknowledged following talks with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper that 13 South Korean troops had tested positive for the virus.
“We do regard this situation as a serious one,” Jeong told a news conference, adding he had suspended military vacations and off-base leave.
“We have also limited their movement across the nation.”
Earlier on Monday, the U.S. military said a 61-year-old woman in South Korea who tested positive for the virus had recently visited a U.S. military base in the southeastern city of Daegu.
The woman, who was the widow of a former U.S. servicemember, visited a store at Camp Walker on Feb. 12 and 15, the military said. It was the first infection connected to U.S. Forces Korea, which counts about 28,500 American troops on the peninsula.
U.S. Forces Korea said it was raising the risk level to “high” across the country. It urged U.S. troops to limit travel and “use extreme caution when traveling off-installation.”
South Korea – which remains technically at war with the nuclear-armed North – has the most virus cases in Asia outside China and reported 60 new cases on Tuesday, increasing the total number of infected patients in the country to 893.
Of the new cases, 16 were in the southeastern city of Daegu, where a church at the center of the outbreak is located, and 33 were from North Gyeongsang Province, health officials said.
Americans should avoid all nonessential travel to South Korea due to the coronavirus outbreak, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday.
Japanese Health Minister Katsunobu Kato said it was too early to talk about cancelling the Tokyo Summer Olympics, which start on July 24, due to the coronavirus. Japan has 850 cases, most from a cruise ship, and has recorded four deaths.
Questions have risen about whether the Olympics should be moved or canceled, with one London mayoral candidate saying London was ready to host the games if needed.

PEAK IN CHINA
China reported a rise in new coronavirus cases in Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, on Tuesday while the rest of the country saw a fourth-straight day of declines.
Hubei had 499 new confirmed cases on Feb. 24, the National Health Commission said, up from 398 a day earlier and driven mainly by new infections in the provincial capital of Wuhan.
Mainland China reported 508 new cases, up from 409 on Feb. 23, bringing the total number to 77,658.
The epidemic in China peaked between Jan. 23 and Feb. 2 and has been declining since, said the World Health Organization (WHO). China’s actions of locking down cities and severely restricting the movement of people has probably prevented hundreds of thousands of cases, it said.
“They’re at a point now where the number of cured people coming out of hospitals each day is much more than the sick going in,” said head of the WHO delegation in China, Bruce Aylward.
Italy on Monday became the new frontline in the fight against the coronavirus with 220 cases reported from just three on Friday. The death toll in Italy stands at seven.
Italian authorities have sealed off the worst-affected towns, closed schools and halted the carnival in Venice, where there were two cases.
Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Afghanistan and Iraq reported their first new coronavirus cases, all in people who had been to Iran where the toll was 12 dead and 61 infected. Most of the Iran infections were in the Shi’ite Muslim holy city of Qom.
Asian share markets were trying to stabilize on Tuesday after the surge of cases outside mainland China and fears of a pandemic sent global markets into a tailspin.
Some dealers cited a Wall Street Journal report on a possible vaccine as helping sentiment, though human tests of the drug might not start until the end of April.
European equities markets suffered their biggest slump since mid-2016 on Monday, gold soared to a seven-year high and oil tumbled 4%.
The Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 posted their biggest one-day percentage drops in over two years and Nasdaq had one of its worst days since December 2018.
Wall Street’s fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index, jumped to a one-year high.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the word “pandemic” did yet not fit the facts.
“We must focus on containment while preparing for a potential pandemic,” he told reporters in Geneva, adding that the world was not witnessing an uncontained spread or large-scale deaths.
Outside mainland China, the outbreak has spread to about 29 countries and territories, with a death toll of about two dozen, according to a Reuters tally.

Can Gilead’s Remdesivir Treat Coronavirus?,"Gilead Sciences antiviral drug remdesivir may be the best shot for treating the coronavirus, said an official from the World Health Organization (WHO). But can Gilead’s Remdesivir treat Coronavirus?

Remdesivir, an experimental drug developed to fight Ebola virus, is currently undergoing clinical trial in coronavirus patients in China. WHO expects the trial data to be available within weeks.
At a press briefing in Beijing, WHO assistant director-general Bruce Aylward said: “There is only one drug right now that we think may have real efficacy and that’s remdesivir.”
According to CNN, Gilead collaborated with Chinese health authorities on two trials of the drug in Covid-19 patients.
Gilead Sciences spokesman was quoted as saying: “The two studies, one in patients with severe disease and another in patients with moderate disease, are currently enrolling participants and we anticipate results in April.”
Earlier this month, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced that remdesivir could prevent a type of coronavirus in monkeys.
According to data from a study conducted by the NIH, the drug prevented the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease when administered before infection. In infected animals, remdesivir improved their condition.
Drug developer Gilead shares soared to 16-month high after WHO official said its experimental treatment is best shot for fighting coronavirus. The company soared as much as 6.9% after the open before paring some gains. The jump pushed Gilead’s shares to their highest level since October 2018.
The biotech company’s stock is up roughly 13% in February, surging on investor hopes that its treatment can be the first to curb the coronavirus outbreak. Gilead spiked as much as 13% on February 3 after Bloomberg News reported the remdesivir drug would begin human trials in Beijing.

Can Gilead’s Remdesivir Treat Coronavirus?
An exclusive interview of Mr. Xiao En, a former Virologist at the US Army Research Institute on the many important questions related to Coronavirus Coverup by the Chinese administration conducted by the New Tang Dynasty Television (NTDTV) in Chinese and translated into English by GreatGameIndia team, deals with the question of whether Gilead’s Remdesivir can treat Coronavirus.
Below are excerpts from the interview:
EXCLUSIVE#Coronavirus Bioweapon Thread
How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized Ithttps://t.co/tc7W2DrmAA
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 27, 2020

Moderator: Speaking of outside help, I would also like to ask Mr. Xiao En very soon, that is, we know that the United States has a western medicine that is being clinically tested in China. This medicine is called the hope of the people by Chinese citizens. May be effective. Would you please talk to us quickly, that is, the drug of the company Gilead in the United States, what is the rationale behind its effectiveness (Remdesivir)? Another one, do you think it can work in a large area in a clinical environment?
Xiao En: I think this matter should be treated with caution, because there are often many things in the domestic media that have the magnifying effect of propaganda machines; it is as if to give people hope at once, a savior has come. No matter where this medicine is provided, the official media of the Chinese Communist Party will have such a propaganda purpose behind it.
But in fact, from a medical point of view, you must be cautious about this medicine. It (Remdesivir) is really not a drug for coronavirus, it is a broad-spectrum RNA-like drug. Basically, after the drug enters the human body, it will produce an intermediate state substance during metabolism. This substance can inhibit this replication of the virus, and it will have such an effect.
But in the past, a drug was developed to fight the Ebola virus. And when Ebola broke out in 2014, it was actually applied to patients in a small amount, but it was not applied on a large scale. After 2018, when Ebola broke out in the Congo, some human studies were done on a large scale. But local doctors later said that in fact, no obvious effect was seen.
So this drug, now in the United States it (Remdesivir) does see a certain effect in a patient. As for whether this large-scale human experiment has a clear effect? I think there will be many question marks. Because what is involved here is that there is a problem with the amount of medicine used in the hospital. How long does this patient take this medicine (Remdesivir)? When should we observe the changes of patients? Does the patient’s virus rebound during this medication? Then how does the relative side effect of the body itself compare with the effect of this (Remdesivir)? I think there are a lot of them. In fact, this is from pharmacology. You also have to take a closer look at how effective this medicine is.
It’s not that simple. It doesn’t mean that suddenly a medicine becomes the people’s savior. I don’t think so, but think objectively. It is indeed more important now to treat the entire epidemic situation very rationally. As for the treatment of patients, it is also inevitable that China should also adopt a comprehensive treatment of multiple drugs.
Including Wuhan University of Virology’s previous experiments on their simple in vitro cells, they also found that there are other drugs, such as even a broad spectrum, that target HIV. And Chloroquine, etc., these drugs may be effective. Because it involves Ebola and this coronavirus. It has similarities in the process by which the virus enters the body and associates with this ENDOSOME. Therefore, some drugs may have similar effects, but how much side effects on the human body really need to be carefully studied in order to show that this drug can be safely used in large areas.
Moderator: Yes, in fact these days around this medicine (Remdesivir), I think the latest hot spot is rather unexpected, but please also talk about Mr. Tang Jingyuan, the patent issue surrounding this medicine (Remdesivir). We see that the Wuhan Institute of Virology has registered this patent on January 21 that this drug can work on this coronavirus. But this drug was developed by an American company, so what is going on with this patent? What do you think of this?
Tang Jingyuan: I think this patent is actually a trick of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The patent they applied for was not actually for the drug Remdesivir itself. Because the drug itself was developed by an American company, it is impossible to grab it with such an open fire. The patent it applied for was a formula made by combining the drug Remdesivir with another drug called chloroquine phosphate. It said that this medicine had a certain effect on the disease of new coronary pneumonia (2019-nCoV), so the patent applied for refers to this formula. In other words, let’s make an analogy. If the medicine Remdesivir is a nutritious meatball, then the Chinese Academy of Sciences actually uses a high-level deceit, or a high-level theft. The Chinese Academy of Sciences took the medicine, brought the meatballs, and then wrapped it with a thin layer of dough. This is a dumpling, and then they applied for a patent. Its like I am applying for a patent for this bun, or a patent for this dumpling. So in other words, it is a very clever technique, but everyone knows that you got to eat that bun, or eat the dumpling. The real thing is to eat that stuffing!
Moderator: Mainly that stuffing.
Tang Jingyuan: The most important thing is that stuffing. What really works is that stuffing. Because of this chloroquine phosphate they are combined. What kind of medicine is chloroquine phosphate? This medicine is mainly used to treat malaria. We know that the pathogen of malaria is Plasmodium, which is a parasite. Therefore, it is actually a completely different pathogen from the virus, so why does this chloroquine phosphate also have such an inhibitory effect on the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)? This rationale has not been clear to even these experts. They are a bit like going for a test now. Anyway, I take this medicine out and try it, and then take another medicine and try it out. Maybe this is the kind.

Study Shows CT Scan Best Diagnosis For Coronavirus,"In a study of more than 1,000 patients published in the journal Radiology, chest CT outperformed lab testing in the diagnosis of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The researchers concluded that CT should be used as the primary screening tool for COVID-19.

In the absence of specific therapeutic drugs or vaccines for COVID-19, it is essential to detect the disease at an early stage and immediately isolate an infected patient from the healthy population.
According to the latest guidelines published by the Chinese government, the diagnosis of COVID-19 must be confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene sequencing for respiratory or blood specimens, as the key indicator for hospitalization. However, with limitations of sample collection and transportation, as well as kit performance, the total positive rate of RT-PCR for throat swab samples has been reported to be about 30% to 60% at initial presentation.
In the current public health emergency, the low sensitivity of RT-PCR implies that a large number of COVID-19 patients won’t be identified quickly and may not receive appropriate treatment. In addition, given the highly contagious nature of the virus, they carry a risk of infecting a larger population.
“Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for disease treatment and control. Compared to RT-PCR, chest CT imaging may be a more reliable, practical and rapid method to diagnose and assess COVID-19, especially in the epidemic area,” the authors wrote.

Chest CT, a routine imaging tool for pneumonia diagnosis, is fast and relatively easy to perform. Recent research found that the sensitivity of CT for COVID-19 infection was 98% compared to RT-PCR sensitivity of 71%.
For the current study, researchers at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, set out to investigate the diagnostic value and consistency of chest CT imaging in comparison to RT-PCR assay in COVID-19.
Included in the study were 1,014 patients who underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR tests between January 6 and February 6, 2020. With RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of chest CT in diagnosing COVID-19 was assessed. For patients with multiple RT-PCR assays, the dynamic conversion of RT-PCR test results (negative to positive, and positive to negative, respectively) was also analyzed as compared with serial chest CT scans.
The results showed that 601 patients (59%) had positive RT-PCR results, and 888 (88%) had positive chest CT scans. The sensitivity of chest CT in suggesting COVID-19 was 97%, based on positive RT-PCR results. In patients with negative RT-PCR results, 75% (308 of 413 patients) had positive chest CT findings. Of these, 48% were considered as highly likely cases, with 33% as probable cases. By analysis of serial RT-PCR assays and CT scans, the interval between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 4 to 8 days.
“About 81% of the patients with negative RT-PCR results but positive chest CT scans were re-classified as highly likely or probable cases with COVID-19, by the comprehensive analysis of clinical symptoms, typical CT manifestations and dynamic CT follow-ups,” the authors wrote.

Were Coronavirus Samples Destroyed By China To Coverup The Outbreak?,"Since the outbreak of Coronavirus in Wuhan, the Chinese Communist Party has concealed the epidemic from the local government to the central government and shirked from its responsibility. Recently, Caixin, a Beijing-based media group published a shocking report that the Hubei Provincial Health and Medical Commission ordered the destruction of Coronavirus samples. Soon after the story was gagged with the article subsequently taken down.

Watch the exclusive interview of Bioweapons Expert Dr. Francis Boyle on Coronavirus Biological Warfare blocked by the Deep State
Gene sequence detected and reported at the end of December
On February 26, Caixin published a shocking article titled “Tracking the Source of New Coronavirus Gene Sequencing“. Caixin sources told GreatGameIndia on condition of anonymity that the article was taken down due to mounting pressure from the Chinese authorities. The article was archived on the web but even the archived version redirects to an error page. So, we decided to publish the Caixin report in full translated into English from Chinese (found at the above link).
The Caixin report said:
As of February 24, more than 2660 people have died and more than 77,000 people have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, a novel coronavirus similar to SARS. When was it found? Caixin reporters conducted interviews from various sources and sorted out relevant papers and database materials. By piecing together all sorts of information, the full picture is gradually emerging.
The Caixin article stated that there were no less than 9 unknown pneumonias before the end of December last year. Samples of the cases were collected from various hospitals in Wuhan. Gene sequencing showed that the pathogen was a SARS-like Coronavirus (similarity is about 80% and infectious). These test results were returned to the hospital and reported to the Health and Medical Commission and the Center for Disease Control.
A private enterprise in Huangpu district of Guangzhou, analysed the gene sequence of the virus on December 26. The results of the study found that it was most similar to the bat SARS Coronavirus, with an overall similarity of about 87% and a similarity with SARS of about 81%.
The company officials communicated with the hospital and CDC by telephone on December 27 and 28, and even went to Wuhan to report all the results of the analysis in person to the hospital management and CDC on December 29 and 30.
Zhang Jixian, director of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Xinhua Hospital of Hubei Province, received four consecutive unexplained pneumonia cases on December 26. On December 27, Zhang Jixian reported the discovery of four “unknown viral pneumonias” to the hospital, which was inturn reported by the hospital to Jiang Han District Center for Disease Control.
From December 28th to 29th, Xinhua Hospital treated 3 patients from the South China Seafood Market. They had similar symptoms of viral pneumonia. At 1 pm on December 29th, Xia Wenguang, deputy director of Xinhua Hospital, convened ten experts to discuss the seven cases. The experts agreed that the situation was unusual. Xia Wenguang reported directly to the disease control department of the provincial and municipal health committees.
On December 29, the industry leader Huada Gene (Shenzhen, China) completed a case of gene sequencing, and the results showed that the virus and SARS gene sequence similarity was as high as 80%. On January 1, the company’s three sample test reports were reported to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.
On December 30, Beijing Boao Medical Laboratory reported the patient report to the doctor, and the test result was – “SARS Coronavirus”.
Health and Medical Commission of Hubei Province ordered destruction of Coronavirus case samples
The Caixin report said that it was not until January 9th that the Chinese Communist Party officially declared the pathogen a “new Coronavirus.”
The report also quoted a person from a gene sequencing company who disclosed that on January 1, 2020, he “received a phone call from an official of the Health and Medical Commission of Hubei Province, informing him that samples of cases of new Coronavirus in Wuhan could not be re-examined. Existing case samples must be destroyed and sample information cannot be disclosed. Relevant papers and related data cannot be released to the public. If you detect it in the future, you must report to us.”
This article from Caixin has now been deleted, but has been circulated widely overseas and in Chinese social media attracting a strong response from the administration.
Beijing authorities concealed the epidemic
In fact, not only the authorities in Wuhan and Hubei provinces and related medical units were involved in the Coronavirus coverup, but also the National Health and Medical Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese authorities concealed the epidemic.
On January 5th, the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center detected a new SARS-like Coronavirus and sequenced it to obtain the entire genome sequence of the virus. On the same day, the center immediately reported to the National Health Commission of the Communist Party of China and “suggested to take corresponding prevention and control measures in public places.”
The report states that the virus shares 89.11% homology with SARS Coronavirus and is named Wuhan-Hu-1 Coronavirus.
Numerous such internal circulars, notifications and reports of studies warning the Chinese administrations were sent out in the weeks leading to the outbreak which were not only ignored but actively suppressed from reaching to people. We have cataloged these findings in our scientific investigation on the origin of Coronavirus – the COVID19 Files – from five major areas, including epidemiological investigation, virus gene comparison, cross-species infection research, key “intermediate hosts” and the findings on the Wuhan P4 lab.
However, the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Health Commission of the Communist Party of China declared that the epidemic was “preventable and controllable” until January 19, and “the possibility of limited transmission from person to person was not ruled out”.
On February 3rd, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying said that since January 3rd, the Chinese Communist Party has notified the United States of a total of 30 outbreak information and control measures. Immediately after the remarks were published, it was strongly condemned.
However, it was not until January 20th that Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang made public statements on the prevention and control of the epidemic for the first time. Zhong Nanshan, a CCP expert, acknowledged for the first time that the new Coronavirus was “person-to-person.”
On January 26, the Communist Party of China set up a task force for epidemic prevention and control with Li Keqiang as the leader. It was after more than two months since the outbreak.
Wuhan pneumonia cases were discovered by the Communist Party of China CDC, Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CPC Health and Medical Committee, and the Hubei Health and Medical Committee by December 1st, and the relevant results were published in international journals.
However, the Chinese Communist Party has been concealing the epidemic, suppressing doctors and people who spread the truth of the epidemic, and spreading a false narrative that the epidemic is “preventable and controllable” and is not “person-to-person”.

Tracking the Source of New Coronavirus Gene Sequencing
Gao Yu, Peng Yanfeng, Yang Rui, Feng Yuding, Ma Danmeng
February 26, 2020
Caixin
Tracing to the source, as of February 24, more than 2660 people have died and more than 77,000 people have been diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, a novel coronavirus similar to SARS. When was it found? Caixin reporters conducted interviews from various sources and sorted out relevant papers and database materials. By piecing together all sorts of information,  the full picture is gradually emerging.
All kinds of evidence show that before the end of December last year, no less than nine samples of unknown pneumonia cases were collected from hospitals in Wuhan. Gene sequencing showed that the pathogen was a SARS-like coronavirus. These test results were reported back to the hospital and reported to the Health Commission and Disease Control System. Until January 9th, CCTV reported that the “Wuhan Viral Pneumonia Pathogen Testing Results Preliminary Evaluation Expert Group” officially announced the pathogen as “novel coronavirus”.
The Test Result of the First Case came Out as early as Dec. 27
On December 15, 2019, a 65-year-old male delivery man in the South China Seafood Market started having a fever. On December 18, he came to the emergency department of the Wuhan Central Hospital (Nanjing Road District) to see a doctor. The doctor suspected that it might be community-acquired pneumonia, and admitted him to the emergency department ward of the hospital. Community-acquired pneumonia is a generic term for pneumonia caused by a variety of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, chlamydia, and mycoplasma. The main clinical symptoms are cough, with or without sputum, and chest pain.
On December 22, the patient became iller and entered the ICU. Doctors used various antibiotics to treat him, but without any good result.  Professor Zhao Su, the chief physician of the Department of Respiratory Medicine of Wuhan Central Hospital, told Caixin reporter that on December 24, a deputy chief physician of Respiratory Medicine took a bronchoscopy sample from the patient, and then sent the patient’s alveolar lavage fluid sample to the first Tripartite testing agency Guangzhou Weiyuan Gene Technology Co., Ltd. conducts NGS testing, hoping to use its second-generation high-throughput gene sequencing technology (mNGS) based on metagenomics to find pathogens. Alveolar lavage is a treatment that removes inflammatory secretions in the alveoli and improves respiratory function. For lower respiratory tract and lung diseases, the content of pathogens in alveolar lavage fluid is higher than that of throat swabs.
Weiyuan Gene is the full name of Guangzhou Weiyuan Gene Technology Co., Ltd., established in June 2018. Its job advertisement states that it focuses on precision medicine in oncology and infectious etiology, and has a sequencing platform (NGS) based on second-generation high-throughput sequencing technology.
“Since the start of BGI’s sequencing technology, many gene sequencing companies have appeared in China. In recent years, at our various medical seminars, the second-generation high-throughput gene sequencing technology has been continuously introduced. These companies have also sent medicines. Delegates went to major hospitals to preach. “Zhao Su told Caixin reporter. BGI (300676.SZ) is called Shenzhen BGI Gene Co., Ltd., formerly known as Beijing BGI Gene Research Center, and was established in 1999. It has successively completed a number of international human genome projects in China, rice and the giant panda genome project, with genomic research with international advanced level. In July 2017, it was listed on the GEM under the title of “The First Gene Sequencing Unit” and is the world’s largest genomics R & D institution.
Another doctor from Wuhan Union Medical College Hospital also introduced, “One test, with 6 million base sequences, costs 3,000 yuan. If with 3000 yuan’s cost, we can find out what virus or bacteria the pathogen is, it may save lives.”
Generally speaking, the gene sequencing company should feedback the test results three days later, that is, December 27, but Weiyuan Gene did not give a written report. “They just called us and said it was a new coronavirus.” Zhao Su said. At this time, the patient was transferred to Wuhan Tongji Hospital on December 25.
On February 21, 2020, the genetic test information of this case was disclosed by an article of WeChat account “Wei Yuan Gene”. The official article wrote that the Chinese Journal of Medical Sciences (English version) published a paper on January 27, introducing the discovery of new coronaviruses, and “Wei Yuan Gene” involved in the early discovery of new coronaviruses.
The aforementioned paper published in Chinese Medical Journal (English version) refers to the article “Identifying a New Coronavirus that Causes Severe Pneumonia in Humans: A Descriptive Study” published on January 29. The authors are from the Institute of Pathogen Biology of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences / Peking Union Medical College (hereinafter referred to as the Institute of Pathogens of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences), China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, Wuhan Central Hospital, Guangzhou Weiyuan Gene Technology Co., Ltd. and other units. Xu Teng, the chief technology officer of Weiyuan Gene, is the co-first author of the paper, and CEO Yongjun Li and chief operating officer Wang Xiaorui are the authors. Li Yongjun was a former bioinformatics analyst at the Institute of Pathogens, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
According to the paper, the researchers collected clinical data and bronchoalveolar lavage samples from five patients with severe pneumonia at Jinyintan Hospital of Wuhan, Hubei Province, and performed pathogenic metagenomics (mNGS) analysis. As a result, a coronavirus with 79% similarity to the nucleotide sequence of the SARS virus had never been reported in these samples. The article shows that among the samples of these five patients, the earliest clinical sample for genetic sequencing was a 65-year-old patient sample collected on December 24. He developed symptoms on December 15 with symptoms of high fever, cough, and low sputum. He was admitted on the 18th and admitted to the ICU on December 22. After 16 days, she continued to have a high fever and developed severe shortness of breath.
Agreeing with the above information is also an article entitled “Recording the First Discovery of a New Coronavirus” published by WeChat account “Hill Dog” on January 28. The author claimed to work in a private enterprise located in Huangpu, Guangzhou in the message area. The article records: “I just went to work on December 26, 2019, and I would like to take a look at the results of the automatic interpretation of mNGS pathogenic microorganisms as usual. As a surprise, It was found that one sample reported a sensitive pathogen, SARS coronavirus, with dozens of sequences, and this sample only had such a meaningful pathogen. I was anxious, and quickly checked the detailed analysis data in the background, and found that the similarity was not It is very high, only about 94.5%. In order to confirm the reliability of the results, a detailed analysis was started. The analysis results of the exploration version suggest that this pathogen is most similar to Bat SARS like coronavirus, with an overall similarity of 87% The similarity with SARS is about 81%. ”
According to the author, the sample collection time for this patient was December 24th. The article mentioned, “The front-end feedback is that this patient is seriously ill and is anxious to test the results, but such a major pathogen cannot be reported easily. At noon, I had an emergency meeting with several leaders and decided to continue in-depth analysis and delay the release of reports. Share the data with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences for analysis. ” The Institute of Pathogens of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences is one of the authors of the above-mentioned “Chinese Medical Journal (English Version)” thesis and Li Yuanjun, CEO of Weiyuan Gene, previously served as the Institute of Pathogens of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, directly under the director of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Academician Wang Chen, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
On December 27, the laboratory assembled a nearly complete viral genome sequence, and the data was also shared with the Institute of Pathogens, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. “It can basically be confirmed that this patient’s sample does indeed contain a new virus similar to Bat SARS like coronavirus.” The article wrote, “The information obtained at the time was that this patient had returned to his hometown and did not rule out contact with bats. Realized the potential of the problem Severity, the laboratory was completely cleaned and disinfected, the samples were harmlessly destroyed, and relevant personnel of the experimental operation conducted relevant monitoring. The doctor had been communicated before noon, and the patient was also isolated. ”
“It should be that we discovered this new coronavirus for the first time.” The article “Little Dog” also gave a screenshot of the GISAID database. “From the data submitted on the GISAID database website, it is also us that collected the earliest samples.”
GISAID is a global influenza virus sharing data platform. After registration, researchers can upload the virus gene sequences they extracted. Each strain will have a unique number, and the time of collection, submission date, submission laboratory, etc. will also be recorded. Caixin reporters found that according to the time of sample collection, the earliest sequence of a new coronavirus gene on GISAIDS was collected on December 24, 2019, and uploaded by the Institute of Pathogens of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences on January 11. It can be found by comparing the number, name, etc. This is the sample sequence of their company participating in the test marked in the screenshot of the article “Little Dog”.
The article also mentioned that on December 27th and 28th, the company’s leaders communicated with the hospital and the disease control (department) by phone. On the 29th and 30th, they even went to Wuhan to personally report and exchange all the analysis results with the leaders of the hospital and disease control center. Including all our analysis results and the analysis results of the Institute of Pathogens of the Academy of Medical Sciences. Everything is under intense, confidential, and strict investigation (at this time, the hospital and the disease control person already knew that there were many similar patients. After we communicated the test results, emergency response has begun). ”
The above-mentioned sample owner who completed the earliest genetic sequencing was later killed at Jinyintan Hospital. The research results of the new virus were detected on December 27, and did not play any role at that time.
“SARS Coronavirus” Detonates Social Media
In fact, in addition to the earliest known case, at the end of December 2019, two samples of “unknown cause of pneumonia” from Wuhan Central Hospital were sent to different institutions for gene sequencing. The test results of the two cases had a significant impact on the disclosure of the epidemic in different ways.
On December 27, a 41-year-old man named Chen went to the Nanjing Road Hospital of Wuhan Central Hospital for treatment. “He is an accountant and lives in Wuchang. He has never been to the South China Seafood Market in Hankou. He started to have a fever on December 16 without any obvious cause. The maximum body temperature was 39.5 ° C, accompanied by palpitations, chest tightness, difficulty breathing after exercise, and physical strength. Significant decline, first seeing the doctor at Jiangxia District First People’s Hospital on December 22, did not improve. “Zhao Su told Caixin reporter,” He is an acquaintance of a doctor in our hospital, transferred to our hospital on the 27th, also an emergency department Closed. “On the evening of December 27, the patient took a bronchoscope sample in the ICU of the hospital’s respiratory department, and this time the sample was sent to another Beijing Boao Medical Laboratory Co., Ltd., which was engaged in NGS testing.
On December 30, Beijing Boao Medical Laboratory reported the patient’s report to the doctor, and the test result was “SARS coronavirus”.
The Beijing Boao Medical Laboratory’s test report obtained by reporter Cai Caixin showed that high-confidence positive indicators of SARS coronavirus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected in the patient’s sample. The explanation of SARS coronavirus is: a single-stranded positive-strand RNA virus, which spreads by close droplets or contacts the respiratory secretions of patients, which can cause a significant infectivity and can accumulate multiple organs Systemic pneumonia, also known as atypical pneumonia.
“Their gene bank is not complete enough, or it may not have been reviewed, so they made a small mistake. In fact, it is not the same thing as SARS, or a new type of coronavirus.” A genetic sequencing expert told Caixin reporter.
However, it is this test report that made a small mistake, which directly caught the attention of doctors in Wuhan, sounded the public whistle through social media, and saved a considerable number of people’s lives to a certain extent.
On December 30th, the test report of Beijing Boao Medical Laboratory appeared in the WeChat of the doctor in Wuhan Central Hospital. At 17:48 on the evening of the same day, Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist of Wuhan Central Hospital, released a message among the classmates: “7 cases of SARS were confirmed in the South China Fruit and Seafood Market, and they were isolated in the emergency department of our hospital.” At 19:39, the Wuhan Red Cross Hospital neurologist Liu Wen published a message in his work WeChat group “Xiehe Honghui Shennei”, saying: “Just a case of coronal infectious virus pneumonia was confirmed in Houhu District of the Second Hospital (that is, Wuhan Central Hospital). Maybe it will be isolated in southern China.” “SARS has been basically determined, nurses and sisters should not go out to shake.” At 20:48, Xie Linka, a doctor at the Cancer Center of Wuhan Union Medical College, posted a message on the WeChat group of the Cancer Center. “Don’t go to the South China Seafood Market in the near future. It is happening now. With many people suffering from unexplained pneumonia (similar to SARS), today our hospital has treated several cases of pneumonia patients in the South China Seafood Market. Everyone should pay attention to wearing masks and ventilation “-all three doctors have been cautioned by the police since then.
On the same day, the author of the “Little Dog” in Huangpu, Guangzhou, was also informed of the above news, and he wrote: “By December 30th, I heard that there were still many patients with similar symptoms, and the nerves broke down again. It ’s tense. Especially, it may be the afternoon of the 30th. A friend may have detected the same virus in the sample of another patient, but they sent a report that the SARS coronavirus was detected, and the news was detonated instantly. Now … the friends shared the sequence for us to analyze. I analyzed it and it was indeed the same virus! The first idea in the subconscious was ‘this virus is contagious!’ ”
Li Wenliang and others opened the lid, allowing the gene company to sequence the story of this line, and another story of the clinician’s warning generated an intersection. At the Wuhan Central Hospital, doctors are not responding to routine treatment of emerging viral pneumonia patients, and hope to find answers through gene sequencing companies, while Zhang Jixian, director of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Xinhua Hospital, Hubei Province, adjacent to the South China Seafood Market, December 26 Four consecutive unidentified pneumonia cases were received on the day. On December 27, Zhang Jixian reported the discovery of four “unknown viral pneumonias” to the hospital, and the hospital reported to the Jianghan CDC.
On December 28-29, Xinhua Hospital treated three more patients from the South China Seafood Market. They had similar symptoms of viral pneumonia. According to subsequent reports such as the Wuhan Evening News, at 1 pm on December 29, Xia Wenguang, deputy director of Xinhua Hospital, convened ten experts to discuss the seven cases. The experts agreed that the situation was unusual, and Xia Wenguang went directly to the provincial and municipal health authorities. Report from the CDC. Also reported on the same day was the Public Health Department of Wuhan Central Hospital. In the afternoon of the same day, the Hubei Province, Wuhan City Health and Health Commission’s Disease Control Office notified the provincial, city, and district level three disease control centers, Xinhua Hospital, and the Central Hospital Houhu Hospital to treat multiple patients with unknown pneumonia with a history of seafood market exposure. Start emergency response workflow. Hubei Provincial CDC and Wuhan CDC started epidemiological investigations with the CDCs in Jianghan District, Qiaokou District, and Dongxihu District. Huang Chaolin, deputy director of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, came to Xinhua Hospital and took six Of the patients, Wuhan Tongji Hospital also transferred the aforementioned patient who was the first genetic test in the central hospital to Jinyintan Hospital.
On December 30, the third-level disease control center formed the “Report on the Investigation and Disposal of Multiple Pneumonia Cases Reported by the Hospital in the South China Seafood Market”. On the same day, the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission issued an internal notice, mentioning that many medical institutions in Wuhan did have multiple unexplained pneumonia cases in succession, and was related to the Wuhan South China Seafood Wholesale Market, requiring medical institutions to report those who had received consultations in the past week. Patients with similar characteristics of unexplained pneumonia.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission’s “Emergency Notice on Doing a Good Job in the Treatment of Unexplained Pneumonia” triggered by Zhang Jixian’s insistence on reporting was soon exposed on the Internet, along with WeChat warnings from doctors such as Li Wenliang who saw the gene sequencing report. Let the epidemic information originated in Wuhan be transmitted to the outside world for the first time.
Warning from Shanghai
Another case sample from Wuhan Central Hospital comes from Houhu Hospital, which is also adjacent to the South China Seafood Market. The patient, also named Chen, is a 41-year-old self-employed member of the seafood market in Quanzhou, Fujian. He suffered from high fever of 40 ° C, systemic aches and pains, cough, sputum, shortness of breath, and shortness of breath after experiencing cold on December 20. He was hospitalized in Houhu District of Wuhan Central Hospital with “fever cause, lung infection” on December 30th. The hospital took a bronchoscope sample on December 30th. An extra sample of respiratory lavage fluid was left in the refrigerator at -80. ° C environment.
“The reason why we have kept one more sample is because we have been involved in major national science and technology projects of China’s major natural epidemic virus, such as Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center affiliated to Fudan University (hereinafter referred to as Shanghai Public Health Center) and Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Resources’ project cooperation, cooperation agreement has been signed for five years in a row, Wuhan City Center for Disease Control is responsible for the collection of clinical samples and environmental specimens in Central China, and regularly sent to Shanghai Public Health Center for pathogen detection, they have biological safety The third-level (BSL-3) laboratory has a high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis platform, and our hospital is the sentinel hospital of Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “Professor Zhao Su of the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Wuhan Central Hospital.
On the afternoon of December 30, the samples were taken by a chief physician of Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On January 2nd, another researcher from Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention wrapped the samples in dry ice, iron boxes, and foam boxes, and shipped them to Shanghai by rail along with other animal specimens. On January 3, the team of Professor Zhang Yongzhen from Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center received the samples. This center belongs to Fudan University, Zhang Yongzhen is a researcher at the Institute of Infectious Diseases Prevention and Control of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and an adjunct professor at the Institute of Biomedicine of Fudan University and Shanghai Public Health Center. Under the funding of key research and development programs, he is engaged in scientific research such as zoonotic diseases, investigation of major natural epidemic-derived virus resources in China, and many hospitals, including Wuhan Central Hospital, Wuhan CDC, and the University of Sydney, Australia. As a member of the project team.
In the early morning of January 5, Zhang Yongzhen’s research team detected a new SARS-like coronavirus from the samples and obtained the entire genome sequence of the virus through high-throughput sequencing. The evolutionary tree drawn based on the sequencing data also confirmed the new corona in Wuhan Viruses have never been seen in history. The Shanghai Public Health Center immediately reported to the competent authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission and the National Health Commission on the same day, reminding them that the new virus is homologous to SARS and should be transmitted through the respiratory tract. It is recommended that appropriate disease control and prevention measures be taken in public. On January 6, a secondary emergency response was initiated within the China CDC.
“We have been collaborating with Wuhan Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Wuhan Central Hospital, etc. to collect new natural epidemic viruses. This is part of our major national project, including the use of P3 laboratories. It was approved by the review. “A researcher at the Shanghai Public Health Center told Caixin reporter,” We are a regular researcher, and found by accident that it is of great importance and report it immediately.”
Atleast 9 samples were collected for Inspection at the end of last year
Caixin reporter confirmed that it is almost in front of Guangzhou Weiyuan Gene Technology Co., Ltd. and Beijing Boao Medical Laboratory. Several gene sequencing companies have obtained samples of unknown pneumonia cases from Wuhan Hospital. This includes an industry “leading leader”, BGI, who received a gene sequencing commission from Wuhan Union Medical College Hospital on December 26, 2019. On December 29, BGI’s genetic sequencing of the case sample showed that the virus and SARS gene sequence similarity was as high as 80%, but not SARS, but a coronavirus that had not been seen before. BGI also used their SARS test kit to test the cases, and the results were negative, and it was negative for SARS.
On December 30, BGI orally notified the sequencing results to Wuhan Union Medical College Hospital, saying that the pathogen is a new coronavirus similar to SARS, and it is recommended that the hospital report to Wuhan Municipal Health Commission.
A person from BGI told Caixin reporters that when they were commissioned to sequence samples of unexplained viral pneumonia cases at the end of December, they did not know that the virus had caused clinical infections in many people, and even had the same genus. Cluster infections in a family. “We are a technology company doing gene sequencing. We accept a lot of sequencing commissions every day. When we come into contact with a large number of viruses, we also find many new viruses. There are many types of coronaviruses. Previously, there were only six coronaviruses including SARS and humans. Related, only SARS and MERS are more infectious to humans. At that time we did not know whether the virus was ‘good’ or ‘bad’. ”
BGI has a long-term cooperation with the local hospital in Wuhan. According to a survey by Caixin reporters, the local hospital in Wuhan in December 2019 sent at least 30 samples of difficult pneumonia to Huage Gene for sequencing. Huada found a total of three cases of pneumonia that belonged to the new coronavirus infection. Except for the case on December 26, two other cases were collected on December 29 and 30, respectively.
The relevant information obtained by Caixin reporters shows that on December 30 and 31, Huada conducted a high-level retest of the recently received cases. On December 31, they mixed three SARS-like coronaviruses. That is, the three viral gene sequence fragments are combined to form a mixed whole gene sequence. On January 1, the mixed new coronavirus gene sequence was provided to the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and three test reports were also reported to the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission. On the same day, BGI rebuilt the entire genome, and obtained a whole genome sequence that day. On January 3, BGI completed sequencing of the entire gene sequence of the viruses in all three samples.
However, BGI did not publicly announce the genome sequences of these three samples of New Coronavirus. Caixin reporters found that as of January 19, 2020, a total of 13 samples of New Coronavirus genome sequences were uploaded on the GISAID platform. Except for Japan and Thailand, the remaining 10 are all uploaded by Chinese research institutes. From the time of sample collection, the earliest case was the one collected on December 24, 2019 and uploaded by the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Pathogen. Eight more samples were collected on December 30, respectively, Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital and Hubei Provincial Center for Disease Control (1), Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (5), China CDC Virus Disease Prevention and Control Office (Article 2).
In addition, the Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention also uploaded a gene sequence for collecting samples completed on January 1, 2020.
According to the Hubei Daily, on December 30, Zhang Dingyu, the president of Jinyintan Hospital, led everyone to collect bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the 7 patients admitted by the hospital and sent them to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences to be tested.
Based on the industry’s average detection cycle of three days, by January 2nd, the genetic sequencing results of the samples collected on December 30th above should have been obtained. In an open letter from Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan Institute of Virology fully carried out scientific research on the new crown virus pneumonia, it was stated that on the evening of December 30, the virus received an unknown pneumonia sample from Jinyintan Hospital on the evening of December 30. The whole genome sequence of the new crown virus was determined on January 2 and uploaded to GISAID on January 11.
The above-mentioned paper published in the “Chinese Medical Journal (English version)” also shows that in the nine days from December 24, 2019 to January 1, 2020, five patients’ alveolar lavage fluid samples were collected and sent for testing. Analysis, and two of these five patients had no history of contact with the South China Seafood Market.
Of the five patients, in addition to the 65-year-old patient samples, three patients were collected on December 30, 2019. Among them, Patient No. 2 was a 49-year-old female who worked in the South China Seafood Market. She started to have a high fever and a dry cough on December 22. She developed dyspnea after five days and was hospitalized. She was admitted to the ICU on December 29. Patient No. 3 was also Female, 52 years old, onset on December 22, was hospitalized on the 29th, but she has no history of contact with the seafood market; Patient No. 4 is a 41-year-old male. He started to have a high fever, dry cough on December 16, and was hospitalized on the 22nd-this There is no history of seafood market exposure. The man is obviously the Wuchang accountant who was treated at the Wuhan Central Hospital above. The sample of alveolar lavage fluid from patient No. 5 was collected on January 1, 2020. He is a member of the South China Seafood Market. A 61-year-old man at work. He suffered from chronic liver disease and abdominal myxoma. He had fever, cough, and dyspnea for seven days. He was admitted to a local hospital. He started to use ECMO for rescue on January 2 and died.
According to the paper, a new coronavirus was identified in the laboratory in this way. It has 79% similarity to the nucleotide sequence of SARS virus. It is phylogenetically closest to the SARS-like coronavirus carried by bats, but forms Coronavirus beta strain sequence of a single evolutionary branch. After carrying out virus isolation, morphological confirmation and serological testing, the new pathogen was confirmed to be a new coronavirus. The amino acid sequence of this virus-receptor binding domain is similar to that of SARS coronavirus, indicating that the two viruses may bind to the same receptor on human cells.
Looking back on the days from the end of December 2019 to the beginning of January this year, it should have been a crucial moment in determining the fate of countless people. But at that time, the public did not know the consequences of the virus in the future.
A source from a gene sequencing company revealed that on January 1, 2020, he received a phone call from an official of the Health Commission of Hubei Province, informing him that samples of cases of new coronary pneumonia in Wuhan were submitted for inspection and could not be re-examined. Existing case samples must be destroyed, sample information cannot be disclosed, and related papers and related data cannot be released to the public. “If you detect it in the future, you must report it to us.”
On January 3, the General Office of the National Health and Medical Commission issued a “Notice on Strengthening the Management of Biological Sample Resources and Related Scientific Research Activities in the Prevention and Control of Major Outbreak Infectious Diseases.” (2020) No. 3 states that according to the recent samples of Wuhan pneumonia cases, based on the current knowledge of pathogenic characteristics, transmission, pathogenicity, clinical data and other information, before further clarifying the pathogenic information, temporarily follow the highly pathogenic pathogenic microorganisms. (Second category) For management, the transportation of relevant samples should be in accordance with the requirements of the “Ministry of Health ’s Highly Pathogenic Pathogenic Microorganism Bacteria (Poison) Species or Samples Transport Management Regulations”; the pathogen-related experimental activities Development of a biological safety laboratory of protection level.
Document No. 3 further stipulates that all relevant institutions shall provide biological samples to designated pathogen detection institutions to conduct pathogenic testing and complete the transfer procedures in accordance with the requirements of the health and health administrative departments at or above the provincial level; without approval, they may not submit to other institutions and individuals without authorization Provide biological samples and related information; Institutions and individuals who have obtained biological samples of relevant cases from relevant medical and health institutions should immediately destroy the samples in situ or send them to a depository established by the state for safekeeping, and properly keep records of experimental activities and experiments Result information; during the epidemic prevention and control work, the information generated by various types of institutions undertaking pathogenic testing tasks is a special public resource. No institution or individual may publish information about the results of pathogenic testing or experimental activities without authorization. Approved by the entrusted department.
As for which agencies are “designated pathogen detection agencies”, the document does not mention them. Some virologists revealed that even the Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was once required to stop pathogen detection and destroy existing samples. “Because of the current” Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Law, “laboratory testing, diagnosis, and pathogenic identification of infectious diseases are at all levels. The statutory responsibilities of disease prevention and control institutions, only national and provincial disease control system institutions have the right to conduct infectious disease etiology identification. The Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is obviously not included, let alone those unauthorized commercial scientific research institutions. ”
Perhaps because of this, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Virology, which received the virus samples on December 30, performed virus isolation on January 1, 2020, completed the virus gene sequencing on January 2, and isolated the virus strain on January 5. The national virus resource library was put into storage and standardized preservation was completed on the 9th. These apparently day-to-day research work has not been announced to the public. Only in February when faced with rumors and attacks from the outside world, a word-only disclosure was given.
On January 9th, CCTV reported that the “Wuhan Viral Pneumonia Pathogen Test Preliminary Evaluation Expert Group”, mainly based on the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, determined that the pathogen was a new type of coronavirus. “As of January 21, 2020, the laboratory A new type of coronavirus was detected, and the whole genome sequence of the virus was obtained. A total of 15 cases of positive results of the new type of coronavirus were detected by nucleic acid detection method. The virus was isolated from a positive patient sample, and the typical coronavirus appeared under an electron microscope. form.”
On January 11, Zhang Yongzhen’s research team shared the viral genome sequence information on Virologic.org website and GenBank, the first team in the world to publish the viral sequence.
On the evening of the same day, the National Health and Medical Commission announced that China would share the sequence information of the new crown virus gene with WHO. The next day, five other viral genome sequences from different patients were released by a group led by the National Health Commission on the global shared influenza virus database GISAID. For which agency did the new coronavirus gene sequence information shared with WHO come from? Gao Fu, director of the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, responded to Caixin reporters that the gene sequences came from tripartite institutions, the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. This is a joint research project. The WHO says it has obtained more detailed information on unexplained viral pneumonia in Wuhan from the National Health Commission of China, including information on the sequence of novel coronavirus genes detected in cases, which is important for the development of specific diagnostic tools in other countries significance.
At this time, it is not necessary to look into who first picked the pearl on the crown of science, because 15 days have passed since the first case of genetic sequencing confirmed the new crown virus.
On January 11th, the Wuhan Health and Health Commission stopped updating for several days, and for the first time renamed “viral pneumonia of unknown cause” to “new coronavirus-infected pneumonia”, saying that as of 14:00 on January 10, 2020, Initial diagnosis of 41 cases of new coronary pneumonia. On the same day, the “two sessions” of Hubei were held. Until the end of the “two sessions” in Hubei on January 17, this number has not increased.

Shincheonji Church Of Jesus Linked To Coronavirus Outbreak In South Korea,"The secret cult Shincheonji Church of Jesus is believed to be linked to the Coronavirus outbreak in South Korea. Around 200 members of the secretive South Korean church continued to meet in the Chinese city amid rumours of virus, but ‘no one took [claims] seriously’ at first. Around half the Covid-19 cases in South Korea have been linked to members of the religious group.

Members of the Christian sect linked to a cluster of coronavirus cases in South Korea held meetings in Wuhan until December, only stopping when they realised that their community had been hit by Covid-19, the previously unknown disease caused by the virus.
The South China Morning Post has learned that the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the epidemic, has around 200 members, most of whom are currently under quarantine outside the city.
“Rumours about a virus began to circulate in November but no one took them seriously,” said one member, a 28-year-old kindergarten teacher.
“I was in Wuhan in December when our church suspended all gatherings as soon as we learned about [the coronavirus],” said the woman, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
She said the group was continuing to share sermons and teachings online, but most members had returned home at the start of the Lunar New Year holiday in late January.
Around half the Covid-19 infections in South Korea have been linked to a branch of the church in Daegu.
According to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, there were 977 confirmed cases as of Tuesday – the second highest number outside China – and 11 deaths.
Of the 84 new cases reported on Tuesday, over half were recorded in Daegu city.

A member of the church from Daegu reportedly visited China in January, and health officials in South Korea are investigating whether a cluster of infections in Cheongdo city is linked to a three-day funeral ceremony held at a local hospital.
Chinese sources said that the Shincheonji church has about 20,000 members in China – most of whom live in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Changchun and Shenyang.
One Christian pastor in Hubei province, who declined to be named, said that Shincheonji church members were hard-working and some continued to proselytise even during the outbreak.
The Wuhan kindergarten teacher said she was confident that the recent mass outbreaks in South Korea were not linked to Shincheonji church members from the city.
“I don’t think the virus came from us because none of our brothers and sisters in Wuhan have been infected. I don’t know about members in other places but at least we are clean. None of us have reported sick,” she said.

“There are so many Chinese travelling to South Korea, it’s quite unfair to pin [the disease] on us.”
She sidestepped questions on whether church members had travelled from Wuhan to South Korea after the outbreak.
The teacher said that in 2018 the Wuhan group’s “holy temple” in Hankou district had been raided by police “who branded us a cult”, but members continued to worship in small groups.
“We are aware of all the negative reporting out there after the outbreak in South Korea, but we do not want to defend ourselves in public because that will create trouble with the government,” she said. “We just want to get through the crisis first.”
Bill Zhang, a 33-year-old Shanghai resident and a former missionary with Shincheonji, said the group’s secretive nature made it hard for the authorities to effectively crackdown on its activities.
He said the Shanghai branch held its main meetings on Wednesdays and Saturdays, attracting 300 to 400 people at a time.
“The Shincheonji church in Shanghai has been raided many times and police spoke to church leaders regularly.
“But the church members simply continued their meetings in smaller groups of eight-to-10 people and regrouped when the surveillance was relaxed.”
Zhang continued: “Shincheonji holds that it is the only real church that upholds the biblical truth and all other churches – mainstream or cults – are evil.”

How China France Alliance Created Wuhan’s Bioweapons Laboratory,"On January 23, Wuhan just announced the closure of the city, and the French “Challenge Network” published an article revealing many disturbing details of China France cooperation in setting up a P4 laboratory in Wuhan.
EXCLUSIVE: Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It (watch here Visualizing The Secret History Of Coronavirus)
Watch the exclusive interview of Bioweapons Expert Dr. Francis Boyle on Coronavirus Biological Warfare blocked by the Deep State
The article states that, as France is a leading country in the field of global virus research, as early as 2003, the Chinese Academy of Sciences had asked the French government to assist China in opening a highest-level virus research center. The Chinese request has caused divisions between the French government and virus experts, because although the Wuhan Institute of Virology can fight outbreaks of infectious diseases, some French experts are worried that the CCP will use French technology to develop biological weapons. Indeed a serious warning!
With the support of then Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, China and France signed an agreement in 2004 to cooperate in the construction of a P4 virus center amidst widespread concern.
The French General Administration of Foreign Security warned that RTV, an architectural design firm in Lyon, France was originally responsible for the laboratory’s project, but in 2005 the Chinese Communist Party officially selected Wuhan’s local design agency IPPR (Zhongyuan International Engineering Co., Ltd.) for the project. According to the department’s investigation, the IPPR design institute is closely related to the subordinate departments of the Communist Party of China. These departments have long been the monitoring targets of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
Public information shows that IPPR (Zhongyuan International Engineering Co., Ltd.) was founded in 1953 and is affiliated to China National Machinery Industry Corporation (SINOMACH), a large state-owned enterprise of the Communist Party of China and a Fortune 500 company. SINOMACH is the largest large-scale state-owned enterprise group of the CCP machinery industry and has close relations with the CCP military. Among its 12 departments, it has set up a special “Military Industry Management Office (Ministry of Science and Technology Development)”.
Li Yuan, a former project executive of the Chinese Red Cross Society, interviewed by Radio Free Asia pointed out that since the establishment of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, there has been a serious lack of transparency. The drawing of the P4 laboratory was provided by France. The original design was a layer of negative pressure. A “black hole” was formed in the center of the virus laboratory. Everything outside just flowed to the center and would not leak out in the reverse flow.
Li Yuan believes that the Chinese side does not allow the French side to construct, the purpose is to build something that the French side does not know.
At the same time, some US media believe that these “things not to be known to the French” are related to biological weapons.

COVID19 Files – Scientific Investigation On Mysterious Origin Of Coronavirus,"As Wuhan’s Coronavirus poses an increasing global threat, more and more experts from various countries have also cast more attention to the source of the new crown virus (COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2). In this scientific investigation on the mysterious origin of Coronavirus we explore the sources of New Coronavirus from five major areas, including epidemiological investigation, virus gene comparison, cross-species infection research, key “intermediate hosts” and the findings on the Wuhan P4 lab, to provide readers with a deep and completely scientific perspective.

Two months have elapsed since the outbreak of New Coronavirus in Wuhan, but the scientific community’s knowledge is still very limited on the mysterious “COVID-19” (also called SARS-CoV-2, formerly known as WHO-2019-nCoV by WHO, referred to as New Coronavirus in this report).
Is the South China Seafood Market the source of the outbreak? What role does the closely watched P4 laboratory the Wuhan Institute of Virology play? Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials insist that the new Coronavirus came from the original host bat, and several scholars from South China Agricultural University even claimed that they found an intermediate host – pangolin. However, the scientific community’s research on the viral gene sequence and the comparison and verification of a large number of scientific literature show that the source of the virus is not so simple.

South China Seafood Market: the controversial “source of epidemic”
The Internal Circular
This fierce epidemic broke into public view for the first time with an internal circular of the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission circulating on the Internet. The circular clearly stated: “Pneumonia patients of unknown cause have appeared in our South China seafood market.” It stated that all medical units are required to report similar cases of pneumonia of unknown cause to the Medical and Health Administration of the Health and Medical Commission.
The South China Seafood Market is located in Jianghan District, Wuhan City, Hubei Province. It is a large-scale comprehensive market that includes pork supplies and a variety of seafood frozen products, chilled, dry goods and condiments, and also sells some game products.
When “unknown pneumonia” suddenly appeared in front of the public, the word “game” no doubt quickly became the focus of most attention. After all, the outbreak of the SARS epidemic seventeen years ago has been officially regarded as a calamity caused by Cantonese people eating wild game “fruit beaver”.
Destroying the “Crime Scene”
On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Municipal Health and Health Commission publicly announced for the first time that some medical institutions recently discovered that multiple cases of pneumonia admitted there were related to the South China seafood market. On January 1, 2020, the South China Seafood Market posted a market closure announcement, followed by a thorough environmental sanitation rectification. Guan Yi, a well-known Hong Kong SARS expert, later criticized that this measure was equivalent to destroying the “crime scene”.
Since then, Wuhan has repeatedly emphasized that most cases of Wuhan Coronavirus have a history of exposure or exposure in the South China seafood market. A total of 585 samples were sampled from the Virus Disease Institute of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on January 1st and 12th and transferred to the laboratory for testing.
China CDC’s Statements
On January 22, Gao Fu, director of the National Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a press conference of the State Council Information Office that the source of the New Coronavirus in Wuhan was wild animals illegally sold in a seafood market in Wuhan.

How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized Ithttps://t.co/tc7W2DrmAA
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 27, 2020

On January 26, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that the institute first detected 33 samples containing the New Coronavirus nucleic acid from 585 environmental samples from the South China Seafood Market and successfully isolated the virus from positive environmental specimens. They announced that the virus originated from wild animals sold in the South China Seafood Market.
At this point, the statement that the South China seafood market is the source of the epidemic became the official conclusion.
The explosive Lancet Papers
Unexpectedly, just one day later, a report published online by Science on the 27th raised a major challenge to the CCP’s official conclusion.
The report cited a paper in the world’s top medical journal The Lancet, questioning that the epidemic source of the New Coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan may not be the South China seafood market.
The paper, titled “Clinical Features of New Coronavirus Infected Patients“, was published in The Lancet on January 24. The first author of the paper was Huang Chao Lin, the deputy director of Jinyintan Hospital, the first designated hospital for unknown pneumonia in Wuhan. The rest of the authors included other clinicians in the hospital and members of several research institutions.
On May 4, 2013, a sample of #Coronavirus from the very first infected Saudi patient arrived in Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg via Ron Fouchier of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, Netherlands who sequenced the virus sample.https://t.co/kezdKiTTyH
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 27, 2020

This paper revealed the following key information:
The first patient had an onset of disease on December 1st, which was not associated with the seafood market.
The first patient had no epidemic association with subsequent patients.
On December 10th, another 3 cases had occurred, of which 2 were not related to South China seafood market.
Starting from December 15th, cases with a history of exposure to the seafood market are concentrated.
The paper counts a total of 41 patients, and 14 cases are not related to the seafood market, the proportion exceeds 1/3.
No bats are sold in the seafood market and no trace of bats has been found.
Not only that, but another issue of The Lancet on January 29 analyzed 99 confirmed cases at Jinyintan Hospital, 50 of which had no history of contact with the seafood market. The New England Journal of Medicine also has a paper showing that: Of the 425 cases, 45% of those affected before January 1 had no history of exposure to the seafood market.
Compared with the official report, it can be seen that there are obvious differences between the two. The corresponding official information is as follows:
The first patient’s onset time was December 8th, which was related to the seafood market.
The South China Seafood Market was officially identified as the epidemic source. The first patient had no history of seafood market contact and the above mentioned 1/3 cases had no seafood market exposure Historical data.
Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Zheng Li et al., published January 23, refers to the horseshoe bats found from Yunnan Province containing a virus whose genome they announced was 96.2% identical to the Wuhan Coronavirus, thus virus from bats become a popular consensus.
Infectious disease scientist Daniel R. Lucey of the University of Georgetown in the United States wrote a paper on The Lancet that if the data in the paper is accurate, the first case should be in November 2019. So the first patient has been infected by the virus for a month, because there is an incubation period after infection and before symptoms appear. Some experts previously said that the incubation period of the New Coronavirus is about 10 to 14 days.
Obviously, this means that the virus had spread silently between some places in Wuhan and some people before the concentrated cases of South China seafood market began to appear on December 15. Lucey pointed out frankly: “China must have realized that this epidemic did not originate in the South China Seafood Market in Wuhan.”
One of the co-authors of The Lancet paper and a professor at Beijing’s Capital Medical University, Cao Bin also responded to Science, an American science news website: “It is relatively clear that the (South China) seafood market should not be the sole source of New Coronavirus. But honestly, we still don’t know where the virus came from. Now It seems clear that [the] seafood market is not the only origin of the virus“, he wrote in an e-mail to Science.
It is worth noting that the authors of both the The Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine are doctors and medical experts in Mainland China. On the contrary, the practice of the national expert group of the Chinese Communist Party shows that they seem to intentionally or unintentionally ignore this extremely important information.
Diagnostic Criteria
The first expert group of the National Health Commission had arrived in Wuhan as early as December 31, 2019. According to an interview with Caixin, mainland Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Peng Zhiyong, director of Critical Care Medicine confirmed that the group of experts to investigate the hospital after Wuhan Jinyintan developed a set of diagnostic criteria: have a history of exposure to the South China seafood market; have a fever Symptoms; whole genome sequencing. All three criteria are required to confirm the diagnosis.
Peng Zhiyong said that this standard was not revised until the second group of experts such as Zhong Nanshan arrived in Wuhan on the 18th.
This raises an inexplicable problem: the details of the 41 cases investigated by The Lancet in the first group of experts should be understood. Because in the official notification of the Wuhan Health Commission, from January 10 to January 17, the number of confirmed 41 cases has not changed.
Why does the expert group require that the “history of seafood market contact” be included in the diagnosis criteria when it knows that at least one third of the cases are not related to the seafood market?
People with a little medical knowledge of infectious diseases know that identifying the true source of infectious diseases is one of the three keys to preventing and controlling infectious diseases. Since there is very clear epidemiological evidence and the judgment of the earliest peer experts who participated in the investigation of the epidemic, both agree that the South China seafood market is not the source of the virus, why should the expert group diagnostics criteria “mandatorily” have a history of seafood market contact?
Virological Evidence: Gene Variation in Wuhan New Coronavirus COVID-19
E Protein
January 10 is an important day. On this day, China officially disclosed the entire gene sequence of Wuhan Coronavirus to the world. The world’s top virology experts immediately conducted in-depth research on this mysterious virus and began to publish their own research reports on the new crown virus.
In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. #CoronaVirusCanadahttps://t.co/q4KKG8tI38
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 27, 2020

After an overall analysis of the Wuhan Coronavirus gene, a team of Greek experts released a report on January 27, 2020 saying that they studied and analyzed the genetic relationship of Wuhan virus and found that “the genes of the new Coronavirus has no close genetic relationship with other viruses in the sarbecvirus subgenus“, and the virus has a special intermediate segment that no other Coronavirus has, and this gene happens to be the key to helping the virus invade host cells.
These research findings indicate that Wuhan virus is a new type of Coronavirus and overthrew the author’s original assumption that Wuhan virus originated from random natural mutations between different Coronaviruses. In other words, the author believes that the Wuhan virus did not evolve naturally.
The findings of Greek experts are not alone. As early as January 7, academician Zhang Yongzhen of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the School of Public Health of Fudan University submitted a joint paper to the journal Nature and published it on February 3. The paper clearly proposes that Wuhan virus has the closest kinship with the Chinese military’s two Zhoushan bat virus samples, CoVZC45 and CoVZXC21. Among them, the nucleotide sequence identity of Wuhan virus and CoVZC45 virus was 89.1%, and even showed 100% amino acid similarity in nsp7 and envelope protein (E protein).
Soon, some experts used the comparison tool BLAST from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Biotechnology Information Center (NCBI) to perform a gene alignment on the genome sequence submitted by the Chinese Communist Party for the third time on the 12th, confirming Zhang Yongzhen’s discovery.
The Zhoushan virus
A team of experts from China Disease Center, Lu Roujian also published a paper in The Lancet on January 30, stating that the overall similarity between New Wuhan Coronavirus and a coronavirus previously found in Zhoushan bats in Zhejiang, China, is very high – upto 88%.
The coronavirus carried on Zhoushan bats was first discovered by experts at the Military Medical Research Institute of the Nanjing Military Region. The institute published a paper in English in 2018, announcing the discovery of a new coronavirus in Zhoushan bats —  Zhoushan bat SARS Coronavirus. For the sake of understanding, this paper is referred to as “Zhoushan virus” for short.
Sean Lin, PhD in microbiology and former director of the Virology Laboratory at the former Walter Reed Army Institute in the United States, believes that it is extremely unusual for the amino acid sequences of the E proteins of Wuhan virus and Zhoushan virus to be 100% identical. Because E protein has an indispensable effect on the virus morphology, assembly, budding, and virus pathogenicity of β-type coronavirus. If the virus changes the host, many cytokines will change, and the E protein will necessarily have corresponding changes to adjust the virus synthesis and pathogenicity.
He further pointed out: The genes of the E protein and the genes of the S protein are adjacent to each other. In the viral RNA replication process, these two genes also need to complete the production of subgenomic RNA (subgenomic RNA) to complete replication, which also involves similar Intracellular factors and viral RNA polymerase, so the error rate of gene replication during this process is also similar. Therefore, there is no reason that during the natural viral replication process, the S protein has various mutations, while the E protein remains completely similar with the entire host transformed. This is basically impossible to happen naturally.
Ms. Dong Yuhong, PhD in infectious disease from Peking University and Chief Scientific Officer of Swiss biotechnology company SunRegen Healthcare AG, pointed out that according to Lu Roujian’s paper published in The Lancet, several coronaviruses in the Coronaviridae family and Wuhan virus are the most recent. The amino acid sequences of proteins (S, M, N, etc.) cannot reach 100% complete agreement, such as E protein, with a degree of agreement of 73.2% to 98.6%. Then, why this E protein maintains so much consistency with the so-called “ancestral” bat virus in Wuhan virus is worth further investigation (Lu et al 2020 Lancet).
She said that compared to S, M or N protein, although E protein is the smallest protein among the main structural proteins of Wuhan virus, its function cannot be underestimated. During the human replication cycle of Wuhan virus, E protein is expressed in large quantities in infected human cells. Most E proteins are located at key sites of human cell transport, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, and participate in the assembly of coronaviruses. And sprouts. With lack of E protein recombination, virus maturity is reduced or the ability to reproduce is not strong, indicating the important interaction between E protein and host cells, especially in the virus reproduction, maturity. The importance of transmission ability should also be an important functional protein that determines the virus’s ability to spread in human races.
In a nutshell, Wuhan virus and Zhoushan virus showed this perfect consistency of E protein, which is difficult to explain with “natural variation”.

S Protein
On January 21, 2020, a paper published by researchers in the Key Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Immunity of the Shanghai Pasteur Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences in Science China Life Sciences mentioned an important phenomenon: The sequence of a key part of the S protein of the virus is highly homologous to the SARS virus.
What is S protein? It is the “small mushrooms” on the surface of the virus in the pictures of coronaviruses that are already widely known. This S protein (also known as spike protein, spinous protein) is the most important tool for coronaviruses to invade human cells.
Pasteur Institute experts have found that residues 442, 472, 479, 487, and 491 in the S protein of the SARS virus are located at the interface of the receptor complex and are considered to be cross-species and interpersonal transmission vital position.
Surprisingly, there are 442, 472, 479, and 487 residues in the S protein of Wuhan virus that differ from SARS virus, but this difference does not affect the structural composition of S protein. That is to say, the S protein of Wuhan virus still maintains the same structure as the S protein of SARS virus, and it can still share almost the same 3-D structure in the RBD domain as SARS, and use it to communicate with human cells. The ACE2 receptor binds to easily invade the body.
This is a genetic variation that can be described with precision. It is like a key with 5 clamping teeth, of which the material of 4 teeth has changed, but the overall shape of the key is perfectly maintained, and the key can still open to the human body.
Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, a senior epidemiologist at Harvard University in the United States, also noticed this anomaly. He posted on Twitter on January 28, citing the latest findings of Greek scholars, stating that the virus was not caused by a corona. The virus was generated by recent random combinations, and some parts were “incompatible” with all coronaviruses. The mid-sequence of its genome has never been seen before in coronaviruses and can “encode” a spike protein (S protein) that invades host cells.
Molecular Evolution Clock & Recent Common Ancestors
The molecular evolution clock is a technology that estimates the evolution rate of species through the rate of genetic mutations. It can be traced back to millions of years of evolution, and the short one can trace the source of current infectious disease pathogens.
Roujian Lu of the China CDC Virus Prevention Institute published a paper in The Lancet journal on January 30, 2020, and found that the sequence of the new Coronavirus from different patients in Wuhan pneumonia was almost the same. Sequence identity is over 99.9%. This finding indicates that the new Coronavirus was produced from a single origin in a short period of time and was detected relatively quickly.
Kristian Andersen, a molecular biologist at the world-renowned Scripps Research Institute, also published an article titled “Biology clock based on 27 genetic analyses and recent common ancestor time.” Analysis of 27 publicly published complete genes of Wuhan virus in China, found that the genomes of 24 samples from Wuhan, Thailand, Shenzhen and other places are very consistent, “showing very limited genetic variation, showing that all of these virus strains have a relatively new common ancestor.”
Anderson believes that the virus enters humans from a single source and then passes from person to person. This can be a single animal or a small group of recently infected animals infected to a single person or a small group of people. All cases analyzed were human-to-human, and no animal-to-human.

— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 27, 2020

According to the molecular evolution clock, Andersen calculated the time from when the virus in people first started to spread. The median was December 2 and the earliest could be October 1. This was equivalent to the December 1st when the CCP officially announced the first consultation. Although neither paper speculated on the origin of the virus, the possibility of multiple animal origins was apparently ruled out.
Shi Zhengli: Mystery of cross-species Coronavirus infection
A remarkable fact is that the Coronavirus carried by bats cannot directly infect the human body, let alone a virus that can possess human-to-human transmission. But with the opinion that the Wuhan Coronavirus was created in a lab and growing doubts over the official CCP position, Wuhan Institute of Virology and well-known virus expert of the institute Zheng Li stepped into public view.
Special relationship between S protein and ACE2 receptor
After the SARS outbreak in 2003, Shi Zhengli led the team to collect bat samples across the country for virus detection, and published the results in the journal Nature in 2013. In 2017, Shi Zhengli’s team determined that the SARS virus was recombined from several bat SARS-like coronaviruses and once caused widespread concern.
Due to his long-term research on bat and SARS virus, Shi Zhengli has undoubtedly become the authority in the field of Coronavirus research, and is more focused on the field of Coronavirus infection across species.

— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 27, 2020

What is intriguing is that Shi Zhengli’s research on the Coronavirus S protein, the “passport” for infecting humans across species, began as early as 2010. Shi Zhengli’s team has conducted a long-term, systematic and in-depth study of how coronaviruses can spread across species barriers.
In 2010, Shi Zhengli’s team published a paper to examine the sensitivity of different types of bat ACE2 to human SARS-CoV spike protein (S protein) using live SARS virus and HIV (AIDS) pseudovirus. In the experiment, they also changed several key amino acids of bat ACE2 to test its binding to the S protein and constructed the HIV pseudovirus HIV / BJ01-S with the SARS virus BJ01-S protein. This shows that Shi Zhengli’s team has realized the special relationship between S protein and ACE2 receptor.
Key to Coronavirus Cross-Species Infection
On October 30, 2013, Shi Zhengli’s team released a “new breakthrough” in Coronavirus research. Nature magazine published its paper entitled “Isolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like Coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor“, from the research team including Ge Xingyi, Shi Zhengli, Dasak and other experts from Yunnan. The entire genome sequence of the new coronaviruses RsSHC014 and Rs3367 isolated from the chrysanthemum bat (horse hoof bat). Shi Zhengli provided the SHC014 Coronavirus S protein sequence and plasmid, which is her field of expertise.
In this research, Shi Zhengli’s team also isolated a third type of live bat Coronavirus — the SARS-like coronavirus WIV1 — from bat stool samples, which has a sequence homology of 99.9% with Rs3367 virus. The S protein of the virus can bind to the human receptor ACE2 through the receptor binding point (RBD), and effectively infect SARS virus directly to humans without the need for intermediate hosts such as civet.
This is undoubtedly an important breakthrough. This breakthrough shows that Shi Zhengli and others have initially mastered the “key” for the Coronavirus to break through the species barrier and directly infect the human body.
On November 9, 2015, Shi Zhengli’s team from Wuhan Institute of Virology published a paper in the British journal Nature Medicine titled, A SARS-like cluster of circulating bat coronaviruses shows potential for human emergence. The main content is that they successfully produced a self-replicating chimeric virus, which has the wild mouse SARS Coronavirus of the aforementioned RsSHC014 coronavirus “S protein” which can bind to human ACE2, and thus has a strong infectious power across species. In the experimental results, mice infected with this “synthetic” virus had severe lesions in their lungs, and there was no cure.
Surprisingly, the successful experiments on mice were just Shi Zhengli’s “trial”, and they were preparing to conduct further experiments on primates. This move is undoubtedly dangerous, because it is very easy to think of whether Shi Zhengli’s team was mimicking how to use this chimeric virus to infect the human body.
Academic Controversy
Shi Zhengli’s thesis quickly caused great controversy in the academic world. Simon Wain-Hobson, a virologist at the Pasteur Institute in France, expressed this concern deeply, telling Nature: “If the (new) virus escapes, no one can Predict its path.”
“The only impact of this research is the creation of a new type of unnatural risk in the laboratory,” said Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist and biodefense expert at Rutgers University.”
But Shi Zhengli’s pace obviously did not stop. On November 14, 2018, Shi Zhengli was invited by the School of Life Science and Technology of Shanghai Jiao Tong University to make a keynote speech titled “Research on Bat Coronavirus and its inter-species infection.”
In this speech, Shi Zhengli introduced how her team used “recombination analysis” to discover the latest ancestor of human SARS virus, which may have been reorganized by three virus strains (WIV1, Rs4231, and Rs4081) in a bat cave in Yunnan.
It is worth noting that the report has been deleted from the official website of Shanghai Jiao Tong University for unknown reasons.
New horseshoe bat virus RaTG13
On January 23, 2020, at the time when the new Coronavirus broke out and Wuhan declared lockdown, the Shi Zhengli team published an article on bioRxiv preprinted version of the platform titled, “A pneumonia outbreak associated with a new coronavirus of probable bat origin.” The report proposed that the new Wuhan Coronavirus was derived from bats. The paper was subsequently published in the journal Nature on February 3.
The article mentions that new Wuhan Coronavirus uses the same cells to enter the receptor (ACE2) as SARS Coronavirus, that is, the new Wuhan Coronavirus uses the same “key” as SARS to open the door to the human body.
The article also stated that they found that the sequence of the novel Coronavirus was 96.2% identical to that of the Coronavirus numbered RaTG13 derived from Yunnan horseshoe bats.
As everyone knows, the entire genome sequence of Wuhan virus uploaded by China’s National Center for Disease Control and Prevention was on January 11. So the Shi Zhengli team was able to compare Wuhan Virus and lock the virus with the highest similarity from many coronaviruses in the virus bank in just 12 days, and also isolated, uploaded the gene bank, and even wrote a paper.
Compared with the last 10 years of finding the natural source of the SARS virus , Shi Zhengli’s team is surprisingly quick and efficient this time.
An unnoticeable detail is that Shi Zhengli submitted the registration information of RaTG13 bat virus on January 27th, showing that the virus was isolated from the feces of Yunnan horseshoe bats (chrysanthemum bat) as early as July 24, 2013. It was collected three months before Shi Zhengli published the paper in October 2013, but Shi Zhengli’s paper did not mention this particular virus.
In other words, the extremely important “new horseshoe bat virus RaTG13” , which is likely to be the culprit causing the plague, was frozen in the Wuhan P4 laboratory for seven years.
Why was the “new horseshoe bat virus” frozen for seven years? No one knows the reason for this, but Shi Zhengli now reports that she “discovered” the link between the virus and Wuhan virus; no doubt trying to prove that this virus is the natural source of Wuhan virus.
However, an unexplainable phenomenon is that the comparison of the viral gene sequence shows that the envelope protein (E protein) and membrane protein (M protein) gene fragments ORF6 of the new horseshoe bat virus (RaTG13) and Wuhan virus have reached the amino acid sequence of 100% identical, S protein is 97.7% similar to Wuhan virus.
Virology expert Sean Lin, former director of the Virology Laboratory at the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, pointed out that this is another Coronavirus that is 100% similar to Wuhan virus after Zhoushan virus unusual phenomenon.
He believes that the current research results have also found that the gene sequence of E protein can have a high elastic space. In other words, many positions of this E protein can have genetic changes, but it will not affect it to assist the virus to complete the assembly process. In other words, there is no strong selection pressure to force E protein to maintain the high fidelity of the entire protein gene sequence.
Pangolin Mystery: the sudden “intermediate host”
Unlike the previous SARS epidemic, the Wuhan Coronavirus epidemic has been reported since the outbreak. Officials have always claimed that bats are likely to be the natural host of Wuhan Coronavirus. However, even after the national expert team conducted a comprehensive investigation of the South China seafood market, the officials still failed in declaring what kind of wildlife caused the “national disaster”. The lack of intermediate hosts has also become a major cause for doubt about the origin of the virus.
The Special Pangolins
On February 7th, news came from Guangzhou, which was more than 1,000 kilometers away from Wuhan. The local South China Agricultural University released the latest research saying that pangolin may be a potential intermediate host for the new Coronavirus.
China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority & as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” & the possibility of a “bloodless victory.” #CoronaVirusCanada https://t.co/MEVQ5VWsB4
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 27, 2020

At the press conference, Liu Yahong, President of South China Agricultural University, revealed that researchers from South China Agricultural University, Lingnan Guangdong Provincial Laboratory of Modern Agriculture, Shen Yongyi, Xiao Lihua and other researchers analyzed a thousand metagenome samples and found a β-crown on pangolins. The virus they said may be closely related to Wuhan Coronavirus.
The team also announced at the press conference that through further isolation and identification of the virus, a typical Coronavirus particle structure was observed under an electron microscope; finally, by analyzing the genome of the virus, the isolated virus strain was found to be infecting human. The similarity of strain sequences is as high as 99% and so they declared that above results indicate that pangolin is a potential intermediate host for new Coronavirus.
This is another heavyweight news about the efficient exposure of Wuhan Coronavirus after the Shi Zhengli team announced on January 23 that it has locked the natural host of new Wuhan Coronavirus.
Such a major news naturally caused the mainland media to follow up quickly. On February 8th, the “Southern Daily” exclusively interviewed relevant experts of South China Agricultural University, so that the outside world learned about some unusual facts about Pangolin Coronavirus.
Shen Yongyi of Huanong Veterinary College Research Institute stated in an interview that the pangolin samples found to carry the virus did not come from Guangdong, nor from a specific population. The pangolins were “obtained from certain institutions.”
Feng Yaoyu, a member of the team and a professor at Huanong Veterinary College, in an interview with Caixin, another mainland media, bluntly stated that this batch of pangolins was actually “imported by some units” and obtained “for the purpose of judging the cause”. These samples were “not particularly large”.
Do Pangolin Coronavirus infect Humans?
Obviously, this batch of pangolin is a batch of samples with special characteristics, because Shen Yongyi admits that no such virus was found in the samples of common Chinese pangolins collected by themselves. As to why “a specific agency” took the initiative to provide them with these special samples, it was not mentioned in the report.
Speaking of the most critical question of “how pangolin coronavirus infects people”, Feng Yaoyu replied: “This batch of pangolin is a special group with symptoms. Whether we can infect people or not is not clear at this time, we need relevant information. Further research by the department validated. ”
The Caixin report also quoted a third-party expert who pointed out that in the viral gene sequence isolated from the pangolin by Huanong’s team, there were about 4,000 unsequenced and unclear nucleotides (the new crown virus has about 29410 nuclear Glycine), which needs further analysis. The report also said that to determine pangolin as a potential intermediate host for the new Coronavirus, experts believe that “more evidence is needed.”
Since the evidence is insufficient, the key issue of whether pangolin Coronavirus can infect people is uncertain. Even when the process of how bats infected pangolin was unclear, why did the Huanong team rashly announce that pangolin is the intermediate host and countless experts are doing everything possible? What about the “bridge” from bat to man?
And now more Chinese Biowarfare agents at Harvard University have been caught smuggling deadly viruses from America.#coronavirus https://t.co/BzShbCSWKq
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 29, 2020

Huanong experts acknowledged in an interview with Nanfang Daily that scientists generally publish academic papers before announcing the results. This time, before the paper is written, a press conference is arranged to announce the results, “in response to the national call”, and “it’s very stressful for us.”
Virus expert Ms. Dong Yuhong questioned this: If these pangolins considered to be “intermediate hosts” did not come from Guangdong, how did they enter the Bat Cave in Yunnan, infected with three virus strains, and then how the virus traveled back Guangdong, finally crossed the mountains and waters and returned to Wuhan, Hubei to trigger the epidemic?
Wuhan Institute of Virology: the epicenter of Coronavirus outbreak
Questioning the research results of Shi Zhengli’s team led the outside world’s attention to the source of the virus to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. After all, here is the highest level P4 (bio-safety level 4) laboratory in China’s virus research area.
Since the beginning of the entire outbreak in Wuhan, the Wuhan Institute of Virology has maintained an abnormal silence. This virus research institute has experienced a series of ups and downs since its inception, and it seems to indicate that this research institute is doomed to be extraordinary.
A group of Indian scientists have discovered that Wuhan #Coronavirus has been engineered with AIDS like insertions. The study concludes that it is unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time. https://t.co/u1pY23gYEF

The Sino-French Collaboration
On January 23, Wuhan just announced the closure of the city, and the French “Challenge Network” published an article revealing many disturbing details of Sino-French cooperation in setting up a P4 laboratory in Wuhan.
The article states that, as France is a leading country in the field of global virus research, as early as 2003, the Chinese Academy of Sciences had asked the French government to assist China in opening a highest-level virus research center. The Chinese request has caused divisions between the French government and virus experts, because although the Wuhan Institute of Virology can fight outbreaks of infectious diseases, some French experts are worried that the CCP will use French technology to develop biological weapons. Indeed a serious warning!
With the support of then Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, China and France signed an agreement in 2004 to cooperate in the construction of a P4 virus center amidst widespread concern.
The French General Administration of Foreign Security warned that RTV, an architectural design firm in Lyon, France was originally responsible for the laboratory’s project, but in 2005 the Chinese Communist Party officially selected Wuhan’s local design agency IPPR (Zhongyuan International Engineering Co., Ltd.) for the project. According to the department’s investigation, the IPPR design institute is closely related to the subordinate departments of the Communist Party of China. These departments have long been the monitoring targets of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).
Public information shows that IPPR (Zhongyuan International Engineering Co., Ltd.) was founded in 1953 and is affiliated to China National Machinery Industry Corporation (SINOMACH), a large state-owned enterprise of the Communist Party of China and a Fortune 500 company. SINOMACH is the largest large-scale state-owned enterprise group of the CCP machinery industry and has close relations with the CCP military. Among its 12 departments, it has set up a special “Military Industry Management Office (Ministry of Science and Technology Development)”.
Li Yuan, a former project executive of the Chinese Red Cross Society, interviewed by Radio Free Asia pointed out that since the establishment of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, there has been a serious lack of transparency. The drawing of the P4 laboratory was provided by France. The original design was a layer of negative pressure. A “black hole” was formed in the center of the virus laboratory. Everything outside just flowed to the center and would not leak out in the reverse flow.
Li Yuan believes that the Chinese side does not allow the French side to construct, the purpose is to build something that the French side does not know.
At the same time, some US media believe that these “things not to be known to the French” are related to biological weapons.
China’s Secret Biological Weapons Program
On January 24, the Washington Times published a reporter Bill Gertz’s interview with Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer. Shoham made it clear in the interview that Wuhan Institute of Virology is related to Beijing’s secret biological weapons program.
Shoham has a doctorate in medical microbiology. From 1970 to 1991, he was a senior analyst in the Israeli military intelligence service, leading the rank of lieutenant colonel, responsible for biological and chemical warfare issues in the Middle East and the world. As an expert on biological warfare, Shoham has pointed out that the deadly infectious disease of Wuhan Coronavirus may spread worldwide, and its source is the Wuhan Laboratory related to the CCP ’s secret biological weapons program.
The study was undertaken by scientists from Indian Institute of Technology, Acharya Narendra Dev College and University of Delhi and has been published under title Uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag.https://t.co/RZ4guLZ3Rn
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) February 1, 2020

He said that the CCP has consistently denied possession of any offensive biological weapons, but the US State Department stated in a report last year that it suspected that the CCP government was engaged in a secret biological warfare research and development program.
Shoham further pointed out that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but some laboratories in the Institute are related to the Chinese Army or the Chinese Communist Party’s biological weapons program. And the Institute is not the only one. The CCP has three other institutes engaged in the development of biological weapons.
The Chinese Communist Party has been developing biological weapons long ago. In 1993, the Communist Party of China announced Wuhan’s second biological institution, Wuhan Institute of Biological Products. This is one of the eight biological warfare research institutions covered by the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC), which the CCP joined in 1985.
Shoham also made it clear that the SARS virus has been included in the CCP ’s biological weapons program as a whole, and the P4 laboratory in Wuhan also stores many deadly viruses, including Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus.
Although the Chinese Communist Party implemented a comprehensive blockade of reporting about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, domestic voices of suspicion continue to circulate.

GreatGameIndia investigation on Coronavirus Bioweapon
At present, the epidemic situation of Wuhan Coronavirus is still spreading all over the world. The century-old plague that erupted in Wuhan has been considered the most infectious disease threatening humanity since the Spanish flu. The more serious situation is that in mainland China, which is at the center of the outbreak, many important information is still opaque, including the crucial source of the virus.
White House Coronavirus Task Force
On February 5, the US House of Representatives held its first hearing on related issues. Several lawmakers questioned the Beijing authorities’ concealment of the epidemic in China and said that the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) is losing credibility.
As a direct impact of GreatGameIndia investigation on Coronavirus which found deadly viruses smuggled by Chinese Biowarfare agents from a Canadian lab to Wuhan, where it is believed Coronavirus was weaponized, the White House has opened an investigation to determine if these findings are true and whether Coronavirus is indeed bio-engineered in a lab.
The director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in a letter to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, requested that scientific experts “rapidly” look into the origins of the virus in order to address both the current spread and “to inform future outbreak preparation and better understand animal/human and environmental transmission aspects of coronaviruses.”
The director of the OSTP, Kelvin Droegemeier, wrote in the letter to the president of the National Academy of Sciences, Marcia McNutt, that a widely disputed paper on the origins — subsequently withdrawn — had shown the urgency for accurate information about the genesis of the outbreak.

Coronavirus Bioweapon
This investigation is in direct response to GreatGameIndia’s findings on Coronavirus, as Joshua Phillip puts it:
The original report making the claim about the P4 lab as a potential source was published by GreatGameIndia, a journal on geopolitics and international relations in its report Coronavirus Bioweapon. Other publications, such as The Washington Times, followed, with additional claims based on interviews.
While the narrative of the virus coming from the lab hasn’t been debunked, it has been criticized by several news outlets.
Regardless of where the coronavirus came from, the attention on the P4 lab has focused a spotlight on the Chinese regime’s alleged biological warfare program and is raising questions about the nature of the P4 lab in Wuhan.
GreatGameIndia investigation has also been corroborated by Bioweapons expert Dr. Francis Boyle in an exclusive interview given to Geopolitics and Empire. Dr. Boyle drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, that was approved unanimously by both Houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.
Assassination of Frank Plummer
Further to our investigation, recently in a very strage turn of events, renowned Canadian scientist Frank Plummer who received the Saudi SARS Coronavirus sample and was working on Coronavirus (HIV) vaccine in the Winnipeg based Canadian lab from where the virus was smuggled by Chinese Biowarfare agents and weaponized, has died in mysterious conditions. Frank Plummer was the key to the Chinese Biological Espionage case at Winnipeg’s National Microbiology Laboratory.
For the White House Coronavirus Task Force along with the Indian authorities probing the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a good place to launch the investigation would be Nairobi, Kenya, where Frank Plummer died.
The intervention of the international community is releasing a positive signal. Perhaps the mystery of the origin of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) will be revealed in the near future, allowing people to have more confidence to face this disaster.

BOMBSHELL REPORT: How Coronavirus Leaked From Wuhan Laboratory,"Chinese scientists believe the deadly coronavirus may have started life in a research facility just 300 yards from the Wuhan fish market. Here’s how Coronavirus leaked from Wuhan laboratory.
EXCLUSIVE: Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It (watch here Visualizing The Secret History Of Coronavirus)
Watch the exclusive interview of Bioweapons Expert Dr. Francis Boyle on Coronavirus Biological Warfare blocked by the Deep State
A new bombshell paper from the Beijing-sponsored South China University of Technology says that the Wuhan Center for Disease Control (WHCDC) could have spawned the contagion in Hubei province.
‘The possible origins of 2019-nCoV coronavirus,’ penned by scholars Botao Xiao and Lei Xiao claims the WHCDC kept disease-ridden animals in laboratories, including 605 bats.
It also mentions that bats – which are linked to coronavirus – once attacked a researcher and ‘blood of bat was on his skin.’
The report says: ‘Genome sequences from patients were 96% or 89% identical to the Bat CoV ZC45 coronavirus originally found in Rhinolophus affinis (intermediate horseshoe bat).’
It describes how the only native bats are found around 600 miles away from the Wuhan seafood market and that the probability of bats flying from Yunnan and Zhejiang provinces was minimal.
In addition there is little to suggest the local populace eat the bats as evidenced by testimonies of 31 residents and 28 visitors.
Instead the authors point to research being carried out withing a few hundred yards at the WHCDC.
One of the researchers at the WHCDC described quarantining himself for two weeks after a bat’s blood got on his skin, according to the report. That same man also quarantined himself after a bat urinated on him.
And he also mentions discovering a live tick from a bat – parasites known for their ability to pass infections through a host animal’s blood.
‘The WHCDC was also adjacent to the Union Hospital (Figure above) where the first group of doctors were infected during this epidemic.’ The report says.
‘It is plausible that the virus leaked around and some of them contaminated the initial patients in this epidemic, though solid proofs are needed in future study.’
And as well as the WHCDC, the report suggests that the Wuhan Institute of Virology could also have leaked the virus.
‘This laboratory reported that the Chinese horseshoe bats were natural reservoirs for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which caused the 2002-3 pandemic,’ the report says.
‘The principle investigator participated in a project which generated a chimeric virus using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, and reported the potential for human emergence 10. A direct speculation was that SARS-CoV or its derivative might leak from the laboratory.’
The report concludes that ‘the killer Coronavirus probably originated from a laboratory in Wuhan.’

So far, the source of the Coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan is still uncertain. Several reports published in professional journals have shown that the South China seafood market is not the origin or sole source of the virus. Regarding whether the new Coronavirus is artificially synthesized, the role of Wuhan P4 laboratory in it has been increasingly questioned.
On the other hand, Wuhan Institute of Virology first registered a patent for Radexivir for the treatment of New Coronavirus, causing heated discussions. So what is the source of the new Coronavirus? Does the Wuhan Virus Office involve infringement?

Coronavirus Coverup
Moderator: Hello, audience friends, welcome to this edition of [ Hot Interaction ], today is Wednesday, February 5. So far, the source of Wuhan Pneumonia (2019-nCoV) remains uncertain. Well, different articles published in medical journals show that the South China seafood market is not the only source of the virus, or the true source. Regarding whether the new crown virus is artificially synthesized, what role does the Wuhan P4 laboratory play in it? The questioning from outside is also growing. On the other hand, many cities in China have adopted similar measures to close the city. Tonight we invite two guests to focus on what is the source of the new crown virus? And the latest developments in the epidemic.
One is current affairs commentator Mr. Tang Jingyuan, hello Mr. Tang Jingyuan.
Tang Jingyuan: Hello host, everyone.
Moderator: OK, then there is another one who is connected to us through skype. Mr. Xiao En, a former virology researcher of the US Army Research Institute, Hello Mr. Xiao En.
Shaun: Hello host, hello audience friends.
Are Animal Testing Results being suppressed?
Moderator: OK, thank you for connecting with us. OK, then we also welcome audience friends to interact with us in the middle of the show and talk about your views on this issue. I would like to ask Mr. Xiao En to talk about the source of this new crown virus (2019-nCoV). We also talked about it in a previous show. Earlier in a paper published in The Lancet, it was mentioned that among the earliest 41 infected people, the first patient would talk to the South China Seafood Market. It doesn’t matter; in fact, 14 of these 41 people have no contact with the South China Seafood Market.
So the outside world, including scientists, has been questioning that this South China seafood market may not be the source of the disease or the only source. Then I want to hear your opinion. Has the source of this disease been found? How important is it to find this pathogen?
Shawn: This is a big question mark in itself. Just where did this virus infect people? How did it erupt? So generally speaking, in terms of infectious diseases, of course you find the first patient. From this patient, you follow his experience, who he is in close contact with, or what animal he has contacted, how did he cause the infection? . That information is crucial for the first patient. But at present, because of the CCP, you only see articles reported in a scientific journal, just about some clinical characteristics of this patient. As for the epidemiological history of this patient, these things have not been reported accordingly, so it is tantamount to say that this character is just a “mystery”; because he has done exactly what caused his own infection, he has no idea at all.
This is a big problem in itself. This is actually what the Wuhan Epidemic Prevention Department must explain to the public, that is, according to what they know so far, how did he get infected in the first patient? What is his health now? In fact, this must be explained to the outside world. The other is a big problem. The results of animal experiments have not been released to date.
In fact, if more than 20 of your first 41 patients are related to the seafood market, and you also know from the environment of the seafood market, such as samples collected on the surface of the object, some are positive. That means that this place was an outbreak anyway, right? The nearby animals at this outbreak point are the animals sold in this seafood market, or around the seafood market, such as mice, etc. These animals that are traveling around should also collect samples. This is an important task that the epidemic prevention department should take as soon as possible.
Moreover, at the time, relatively tough measures were taken to completely seal off this seafood market. Some of the stall owners in the seafood market said that many of the goods they sold could not be removed. Then you actually show that the epidemic prevention department is in a good position, whether it is sampling from seafood samples or animal samples, and then make tests immediately. Because this is a very important point in itself, even if you do n’t know that the original virus was transmitted from bats to people, even if you do n’t know that the original host is a bat, you will know what the intermediate host is, because this intermediate host is very Pivotal.
For example, if the mouse is an intermediate host, then your mouse is infected, it may run around and spread everywhere; then even if you block the city and stop all traffic, the mouse will not listen to you Right set? Then the mouse is still raging in this city, and it will run around with the virus. Therefore, the animal’s intermediate host is crucial from the perspective of epidemic prevention, which is also a very important factor to control the epidemic. Just like a normal outbreak, if we know that it is transmitted by mosquitoes, for example, then you need to do environmental sanitation right? Clean up all kinds of culverts and canals, etc., because you have to kill the source of mosquitoes.
If it’s a mouse, you’re gonna kill it, right? You don’t know what the host in the middle is now, and there is no result of any animal sample detection, which is very strange. Because this matter has passed for more than a month, even when such an epidemic broke out in mid-December, when it was known that there was a patient source in the seafood market, animal samples would be collected at that time. So it can be said that for one and a half months, at least no animal test results were provided, which is very strange. And the results of these tests do not need to be published until a leading medical journal is published, which is not the case.
The outbreak of the epidemic situation was the health department at that time. When it was detected, it would be notified everywhere. If it was a mouse, you would immediately take measures, right? If it’s a pig, then one animal is always positive. It is impossible to say that this incident broke out in such a large area in the city, and none of the animal samples tested positive. I think that’s a big joke, so to speak. There must be some animals that must be positive. If the government has not announced the results of this animal experiment, it must be hiding something.
And especially after January, if you have already got infectious strains, even if you take some different animals in the laboratory and do some experiments in common animal models, you will also know which animals the virus is in Is particularly infectious; or particularly transmissible, because you are also facing further risks. For example, if a person is infected, or if there is a pet in the house, if an animal is easily infected with this new virus, then the virus will spread further in the animal and it will cause more people to be infected , So you also need to do some animal experiments. So this is very strange. So far, all reports or official public health warnings have not mentioned any animal experiments, so I think this is a particularly strange thing.
Moderator: Yes, I also want to ask you, because I remember the earliest time, there was an infectious disease scientist Guan Yi in Hong Kong. He went to Wuhan for a few days. Then he said at the time that he went to the South China Seafood Market, but all the places were cleaned and disinfected, so there was no way to take any samples. So what you just said is that you think the official should do animal experiments, but we really don’t know if the official does animal experiments. is not it?
Xiao En: In fact, when Guan Yi went to Wuhan, it was too late. At that time, of course the seafood market had been cleaned up. I mean the government should have collected animal samples long before the seafood market was closed; that is to say, even if you did not have the test agent for detecting the new type of coronavirus at the time, this was all It doesn’t matter, because you have SARS detection reagents on hand, you can know that the sample of this animal is SARS positive as soon as you test it, right? Just like early patients, how do doctors know that there is a possibility of SARS infection in Wuhan Isn’t it just using the same test reagents? That’s enough warning.
And the big thing about this thing is that why the government keeps calling it “new Coronavirus” and then “pneumonia” instead of directly calling it SARS, such as 2.0 or the like. Because if it is SARS, you don’t actually need a meeting of the World Health Organization. It is naturally an urgent public health event of international concern. You don’t need a meeting of the World Health Organization to define this thing and announce it. Therefore, the CCP did not say this, but at that time, it was already known that doctors tested positive with SARS reagents, so this is another irresponsible place in which I think it is incredible to deal with this matter. There is no animal sample that can not be explained to the outside world, so I think the international community should strongly demand that China publish the test results of all animal samples.
EXCLUSIVE#Coronavirus Bioweapon Thread
How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized Ithttps://t.co/tc7W2DrmAA
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 27, 2020

What is the mystery of the Wuhan Seafood Market?
Moderator: OK. Therefore, Mr. Tang Jingyuan, I think Mr. Xiao En raised a very important question just now, is the result of this animal experiment, or whether the animal experiment was done. So if there is no result, I think there are only two possibilities. One is that the CCP did not conduct this animal experiment at all, and one may know that this was not uploaded from the animal. So what do you think about the cause of this disease?
Tang Jingyuan: I think so. In fact, just now I think Mr. Xiao has spoken comprehensively. I will add two important facts. First of all, I can confirm that the official must have concealed something, that is, the problem of pathogens. They deliberately confused their sights. What does it mean? Because according to this paper published by The Lancet. This paper was written by a Chinese expert, and its first author was the Jinyintan Hospital, and the vice-president of the first designated hospital was called Huang Chaolin. Therefore, it is a thesis written by a Chinese expert, which clearly mentions that, except that the first patient was discovered on December 1, and the official announcement was later on December 8, in fact Huang Chaolin was writing In this paper, the official information should actually be known, but the official deliberately confused this sight, and then the official insisted that the pathogenic place was the seafood market. But this review has a very important detail that mentions that out of the top four cases, three have nothing to do with this seafood market.
Moderator: No contact.
Tang Jingyuan: This is a very important detail, which shows that this seafood market is not the origin, the first patient has nothing to do with the seafood market; three of the first four patients have nothing to do with the seafood market, then this is a very powerful one Evidence. But I think the official is confusing these things intentionally. Why does the official have to take this seafood market and say that it is the origin of the epidemic? Because according to this paper, we can actually draw three conclusions; because the author of this paper has also drawn three conclusions, that is, there are only three possible sources of this plague. The first may be someone infected with a virus outside this market and then bringing it into this market; this possibility is the greatest. Because this model is consistent with the 41 cases they collected, the model established by the analysis is completely consistent.
The second possibility is that there are multiple such people or animals that have entered the market at the same time. Because the paper mentions one piece of evidence, it is also the Chinese official announcement that the country’s CDC (China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), are they not sampling in the South China seafood market? They sampled and found that 33 samples were positive. Scattered in 22 stalls and one garbage truck in the entire market, it is scattered in 23 locations. So as soon as you come up, you can see the evidence that as soon as this case began to explode in the seafood market, it showed that it was diverse and that multiple points came at the same time. So this is not very suitable. If you say that the seafood market is the only source, then the second possibility just mentioned, if you want to explain it reasonably, you can only imagine that many people or animals are infected with the virus , And then they (they) entered the market at the same time. This possibility is relatively low.
Then the third possibility is that most people think that there is only one animal, and one animal is infected with the virus, and then this animal enters this market, and it goes around this market, as Dr. Xiao En mentioned just now, such as It is a mouse that can move in it. It has contacted many people and many things, and can cause this phenomenon. It is in the whole seafood market that there are many points where this reaction is positive. So from this perspective, we can basically say with certainty that this seafood market is not the true place of origin of pathogens, and I think this conclusion should be relatively clear.
Moderator: As you said, if the official has concealed this matter, do you think it is because the official has not figured out the pathogen, there is no way to explain it to the outside world, or because there are other reasons, the official has to hide ?
Tang Jingyuan: I think the latter is more likely. Because just as Xiao En mentioned a very important point, we know that this state-level expert organization of the Communist Party of China arrived in Wuhan on December 31 and officially announced this. Well, before the official announcement of this incident, they actually realized the seriousness of the incident, so they always reported to the country, that is, the CDC National Center for Disease Control and Prevention, so they sent this expert group down. Well, before they submitted the report, in fact, I believe that they should be local in Wuhan, for example, experts from the Health and Medical Committee of Wuhan City or Hubei Province. This is the least common sense.
As mentioned by Xiao En just now, if you want to find out if this place is the source of the disease, you must investigate the animals in that place; then the report of this investigation must be taken out, and then you have evidence to prove You have to persuade the public that we can be sure that this place is the place of origin, there is no other place of origin, just such a source. Then you have to come up with this fact to convince people, including your experts in this industry, you also need to come up with such a proof, you can convince these experts. Otherwise, many experts are exactly like the question raised by Xiao En just now. You cannot get these evidences. Why do you say that the South China Seafood Market is the only place of origin? Just in case it’s not. We know there are many seafood markets in Wuhan! There are so many markets like this. In case the South China Seafood Market is not the pathogenic place, it means that many seafood markets may have hidden dangers, and the disease may break out. Why did you only seal such a seafood market? Have you not closed other seafood markets? There is no explanation for this matter, right.
Who is Patient Zero? Why is it so important?
Moderator: So I think this source. I have seen a movie called “Infectious Diseases” before. The scene in this movie is similar to the outbreak of Wuhan pneumonia. So I want to ask, there is a “patient 0” mentioned in this movie, and the end of this movie reveals: how was the first person infected with this virus infected by pigs, and then How so. The process of this infection is very important, so from the beginning scientists tried to figure out who was the first infected. How important is the first infected? Now if this is not clear, what impact will it have on the overall control of the epidemic?
Tang Jingyuan: Let me briefly explain this “patient 0”, why is he called “patient 0” and not “patient 1”? It is “patient 0” from the medical point of view: the definition is that the first person is infected and spreads the virus to other people; such a person.
But “patient No. 0” is not necessarily the first patient, so we can call him “patient No. 1” as the first person to develop symptoms. Then this first one is equivalent to carrying, he may not be sick. Then we call him “Patient 0”, where is the importance of this “Patient 0”?
In several respects, first of all, if you can lock this “patient 0” as soon as possible, you can lock his transmission method, which is the first.
Second, you can ask “History of Patient 0” by asking his medical history, and we can roughly understand how long the incubation period of this disease is. Thirdly, from the process of this “patient No. 0” and his relatives and friends, that is, those who are in active contact with him in society; if we include this close contact person into the scope of monitoring, we can Quickly assess how strong the virus is and how infectious it is. These are very important information, very important data. And if you find this “patient 0”, you can directly lock the infectious agent. How did you get the infection? What animal did you come into contact with? Or come into contact with something unusual. It is “Patient 0” that helps you quickly lock down the real infectious agent.
The last important significance is that if “Patient No. 0” does not have the disease himself, because if he is ill, he will be treated and then spread; this will be easily locked. But we now see that the official did not find this “patient No. 0”, it is likely that he is an asymptomatic carrier, then it probably means that his body, or his physique was just after the initial infection There may be antibodies. Or there is something special in “Patient No. 0”, so that he has no symptoms, and then infect others. This is of great significance for the subsequent development of vaccines, search for antibodies, search for serum and so on. So the key to this “patient 0” is here.
Moderator: Is it possible that among the 41 patients, the first infected person is actually patient 0? But the official has no way to infer from his history how he was infected?
Tang Jingyuan: Right. I think this possibility exists. Because now the official information has not been published, including the article mentioned that: the first patient developed the disease on December 1, but the official did not confirm that this person was the “patient 0”. Because he became ill on December 1, according to this incubation period, he now understands it for at least half a month; then it should be pushed around mid-November, and he may be infected already. When is it infected? What other people did he contact? Nothing is clear now.
Was Coronavirus artificially synthesized at Wuhan’s P4 laboratory?
Moderator: Yes. There is no such information at all, so I would like to ask Mr. Xiao En. Now many foreign experts have begun to work on the virus itself; then there have been many reports recently, that is, their research on this new crown virus (2019-nCoV) Afterwards, there were some similar findings. It seems that this virus is not the same as the general Coronavirus, so many people now question whether this virus is artificially synthesized? Especially the Wuhan P4 laboratory was involved in this whirlpool of public opinion. I would like to ask you first to talk about the outside world’s doubt that the virus may have leaked from the laboratory. Do you think this is a conspiracy theory? Or do you think there are some clues and basis?
Xiao En: I think it is definitely a kind of questioning to say “conspiracy theory”. Because from the perspective of molecular virology, now in the experiment to do different mutations of this gene, to do further virological research, or to develop vaccines, or to study antibodies, etc., in virology It’s not surprising at all to do mutation research in this area.
In addition, the “Wuhan Virus Research Institute” itself has sufficient capabilities. A series of articles published in the past have fully demonstrated such capabilities. It even sent a team to the bat cave in Yunnan for a long time. Hundreds of bat virus samples were obtained every month. The “Wuhan Virus Research Institute” itself has done some recombination experiments, including changing the spike protein of SARS, the spike protein gene on the surface to the Coronavirus skeleton of bats, etc. It has such ability. In fact, it ’s not surprising that we do the corresponding artificial recombination in the laboratory or some important health check mutations. The “Wuhan Virus Research Institute” has this ability, and it may be done for vaccine research Further mutation.
It is more worrying that if you perform such a mutation of gain of function in a foreign country, you must actually pass a very strict medical ethical evaluation; because if the control is not good, you do n’t know the virus has passed. Your change, if it increases its infectivity and its pathogenicity, how much disaster the whole thing brings. What kind of failures and injuries will happen during the experiment? In this aspect, doing research on the gain of function of this more dangerous virus is actually a very very vigilant thing. In the past, there were also scientists who wanted to study the gain of function of avian influenza virus. Later, it caused a rebound in the entire international community and stopped it.
I think what concerns me in China is that, for example, He Jianzheng, an associate professor at China Southern University of Science and Technology, has also done mutations in human genes, and so on, using CRISPR to do this kind of experiment. If it is abroad, it is basically impossible to pass Review. This plan itself is impossible to implement; but China could actually let He Jianzheng go forward. From this example, the review of medical ethics in China is actually relatively loose. The “Wuhan Virus Research Institute” is going to experiment with this virus, not to mention the background of military cooperation. Is the approval process too lax? I don’t know, or it is a military project.
Generally speaking, the “Wuhan Virus Research Institute” definitely has this ability. In addition, the currently detected sequences also have some questionable points. For example, the five important sites of Spike glycoprotein are sites that bind to an donor ACE2 on the surface of human cells. There are five sites within Four have mutations. This becomes a coincidence that is hard to believe, and it will affect the binding of the spike glycoprotein of the virus itself to the body cell surface donor, which is a very strange phenomenon. It was also reported that among the early patients, the sequence of the virus detected in the samples isolated from them by seven or eight patients was almost the same, which is also a little unbelievable. It’s a bit like these people were infected with the virus at the same time, not one patient passed to more than one person, so there were more outsiders who would question whether this was an accident caused by a laboratory leak. The virus itself has traces of artificial processing, and the virus itself has such capabilities. China itself also has a review of medical ethics that also had major flaws in the past. So many factors make people question.
I think the outside world’s questioning is a reasonable question in this case. It cannot simply be slandered as a conspiracy theory; because the responsibility to really clarify this matter lies in the “Wuhan Virus Research Institute”, It is an official of the CCP. They need to prove, or for the responsibility of the government, that they want to check the Wuhan Virus Laboratory, has there been any accidents in the past? Or are there any other deviations in the processing of animal samples? This is the government department to check.
Because if the public raises such a challenge, the government has the responsibility to investigate whether it is possible that the accident was a “man-made” accident. It just wants to agree with the outside world that it seems that the “bat virus” suddenly infected people directly; It has been in the bat for thousands of years, and its breakthrough speed can suddenly infect people, which is a very difficult task in itself.
Therefore, I feel that the responsibility for clarification lies with the government and the “Wuhan Virus Research Institute” itself. We cannot simply describe all the more reasonable questions from the outside world as conspiracy theory. This is a truly irresponsible way statement.
Moderator: Yes, Mr. Tang Jingyuan said clarification. We know that a researcher of Wuhan Institute of Virology is called Shi Zhengli. She came out to clarify, but the way she clarified was very strange. She said: guarantee her life. However, the researcher also published a paper on the synthesis of SARS-like coronavirus in the journal Nature in 2015, and published a paper, just as Mr. Xiao En mentioned, to enhance the virus Papers. So what do you think of the whole thing? Especially now that someone is reporting her by real name, what do you think of the clues mentioned in these reports?
Tang Jingyuan: I think so. Didn’t we mention conspiracy theories in her clues about reporting her? Let’s set aside conspiracy theories first, and let’s not make any inferences. We can enumerate Shi Zhengli’s relationship with this matter. At least four aspects of the evidence are conclusive. The first evidence, Shi Zhengli himself published this paper in 2015. In this paper, she made it very clear that they claim to have modified a coronavirus in bats; that is, a hybrid virus has been made and produced, and this hybrid virus has the ability to infect people. The hybrid virus has not only been tested on mice, it has been verified; it can cause mice to cause lung lesions, and it has also been tested on monkeys. This is a conclusive fact, written in Shi Zhengli’s own thesis.
The second fact is that after this outbreak of Wuhan plague, experts in Shanghai have now discovered that Wuhan virus, let’s call it “Wuhan virus”, is to isolate the virus from patients. Shi Zhengli, we know that her team mainly researched the Coronavirus carried in bats. There are actually many kinds of coronaviruses, and they have studied many kinds. One of them is similar to the virus that is currently isolated in humans The coincidence degree reached 96%. This is very high. At least this is a factor worthy of investigation and a factor worthy of our doubt. This is also an objective fact.
The third fact, we know that in this paper, Shi Zhengli mentioned one thing, that is, how they studied the virus of bats. How can they infect people after the transformation? Xiao En has already mentioned that by modifying the virus, one is called S protein. After the transformation, the S protein can be combined with the human ACE2 donor. We generally say that Shi Zhengli, they built a bridge. The virus carried by bats could not infect the human body, and it could not be infected across species. But they built such a bridge, and the virus could infect the human body.
And now it has been found that this is also confirmed by experts in Shanghai. The pathogenic gene sequence of Wuhan virus and the gene sequence that can invade the human body are also combined by the virus S protein and the human ACE2 donor. That is to say, the mechanism of Wuhan virus pathogenesis and Shi Zhengli’s thesis, which they have now confirmed, are completely the same.
Moderator: What’s the point of her studying this? Let the virus infect the body more easily.
Tang Jingyuan: According to their own paper, the purpose of this research is to study the development of vaccines against SARS virus. Of course, this actually involves a very professional field, and I’m not too sure if her statement is true or not; but we can at least see the fact that this is the third fact.
The fourth fact, we mentioned earlier, that the corona virus is not present in bats. Bats have a history of thousands of years, and they have always carried the virus. Why is it safe for people? It is because the virus cannot spread across species, so it is relatively safe for humans. There is evidence for this. We know that in Chinese medicine, there is a medicine called “Yue Mingsha” in Chinese medicine. “Yue Mingsha” is actually made by collecting the faeces of bats, because there are many things in Chinese medicine that are collected from this natural source.
This medicine has been used by Chinese people for at least thousands of years, because we all know that bats carry the virus. This virus can be excreted in the faeces of bats. What does it mean? We can fully prove that Chinese medicine uses bat’s feces. Pharmaceuticals are safe for humans. It has no problem after eating for thousands of years, indicating that the stability of this virus is very high, and it will not easily undergo any mutation. of.
But why did they suddenly make this mutation after Shi Zhengli did this experiment and related research? According to Shi Zhengli, she said that this is a natural mutation, not our manual intervention, she is such a conclusion. But it seems strange to us. Why hasn’t it mutated for thousands of years, and suddenly it suddenly mutates now? So these are solid facts, and they are enough to play a role.
I think it is worthy of the public or the government to conduct a comprehensive and independent investigation into this matter. At least we don’t give a conclusion now, is it because it has something to do with the research done by Shi Zhengli, we can’t make this conclusion. But there is already so much evidence that it is likely to be related to your research. Is it always OK for the government to conduct an independent investigation?
Moderator: Yes, I see more and more scientists in their papers, because scientists don’t say absolute. But they would say 90%, or very likely, this thing is the result of manual intervention.
Tang Jingyuan: Right!
Moderator: Yes, I think a lot of people are paying attention to this issue. I think this is a must to see what is going on in the end?
Tang Jingyuan: It also includes those authorities that have been nominated by Nobel for many times, some of them are many academic authorities, they think so. When a scientist speaks, he does not say directly that I will give you a conclusion, but after all, a scientist is an authority in this regard. He knows exactly what the probability of this virus mutates, so he can say such things.
Moderator: A lot of information in China is opaque. So I also want to ask Mr. Xiao En. Before the CDC in the United States said that they had proposed to go to China three times to help this epidemic situation and to study the progress in this area, but the CCP rejected it. I don’t know if you think there will be some information in it. The CCP does not want to let the outside world know about such a factor?
Shaun: I think in fact, in the case of such a big epidemic, receiving international assistance should be a very reasonable process. Just like the Ebola virus outbreak that year, your destruction of your entire medical system in that area of ​​Libya was very serious. In fact, an urgent appeal should be made to the international community to help control the epidemic. Because even in such a small country, you can’t easily control it, let alone a big city like China, right? Wuhan’s population is quite large, on such a large scale, and then if you have such a severe outbreak, you receive help from foreign experts. Even with a further assessment of this matter, it is not necessarily directly involved at different levels. For example, it is not necessary for Wuhan to participate in epidemic prevention at this level. But just get involved and say that you evaluate this thing together and analyze the possibility of this thing together. After all, there are quite a lot of experts in this field who are studying coronavirus. The CDC (United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) is also very experienced in epidemic prevention, so accepting the support of the CDC and accepting a consultation of them, I think it should be.
When the CCP refuses to enter the CDC, it will become said that, on the surface, the CCP has always cooperated with the World Health Organization and open cooperation with other countries. You have also learned the lessons of SARS that year. But if the CCP is not willing to help you, it becomes very questionable, that is, does the CCP have any information in the process that it does not want to disclose? Everyone also knows that to a certain extent, the World Health Organization has too much influence on the Chinese Communist Party, and has controlled some of the main leadership staff. Basically, they will not criticize the CCP harder, so they will be willing to cooperate with the World Health Organization. To this day you still see the CCTV broadcast the Director General of the World Health Organization to China to praise China for its good work. This is to define who supports it from the perspective of political needs. Instead of controlling the epidemic, decide what should be done and ask more experts to help control the epidemic. So I think at this point, the CCP’s refusal to accept the CDC should be a political consideration. Are there any hidden feelings at the same time? Then I think if the CDC experts go in later, I think there will be some further news.
What problems does Wuhan Virus Institute’s preemptive registration of a new drug patent reveal?
Moderator: Yes, we hope that the American CDC experts can get in. It seems that so far, it is uncertain whether CDC experts can be included in the WHO expert group. Speaking of outside help, I would also like to ask Mr. Xiao En very soon, that is, we know that the United States has a western medicine that is being clinically tested in China. This medicine is called the hope of the people by Chinese netizens. May be effective. Would you please talk to us quickly, that is, the drug of the company Gilead in the United States, what is the rationale behind its effectiveness (Remdesivir)? Another one, do you think it can work in a large area in a clinical environment?
Xiao En: I think this matter should be treated with caution, because there are often many things in the domestic media that have the magnifying effect of propaganda machines; it is as if to give people hope at once, a savior has come. No matter where this medicine is provided, the official media of the Chinese Communist Party will have such a propaganda purpose behind it.
But in fact, from a medical point of view, you must be cautious about this medicine. It (Remdesivir) is really not a drug for coronavirus, it is a broad-spectrum RNA-like drug. Basically, after the drug enters the human body, it will produce an intermediate state substance during metabolism. This substance can inhibit this replication of the virus, and it will have such an effect.
But in the past, the virus was a drug developed to fight the Ebola virus. And when Ebola broke out in 2014, it was actually applied to patients in a small amount, but it was not applied on a large scale. After 2018, when Ebola broke out in the Congo, some human studies were done on a large scale. But local doctors later said that in fact, no obvious effect was seen.
So this drug, now in the United States it (Remdesivir) does see a certain effect in a patient. As for whether this large-scale human experiment has a clear effect? I think there will be many question marks. Because what is involved here is that there is a problem with the amount of medicine used in the hospital. How long does this patient take this medicine (Remdesivir)? When should we observe the changes of patients? Does the patient’s virus rebound during this medication? Then how does the relative side effect of the body itself compare with the effect of this (Remdesivir)? I think there are a lot of them. In fact, this is from pharmacology. You also have to take a closer look at how effective this medicine is.
It’s not that simple. It doesn’t mean that suddenly a medicine becomes the people’s savior. I don’t think so, but think objectively. It is indeed more important now to treat the entire epidemic situation very rationally. As for the treatment of patients, it is also inevitable that China should also adopt a comprehensive treatment of multiple drugs.
Including Wuhan University of Virology’s previous experiments on their simple in vitro cells, they also found that there are other drugs, such as even a broad spectrum, that target HIV (HIV). And Chloroquine, etc., these drugs may be effective. Because it involves Ebola and this coronavirus. It has similarities in the process by which the virus enters the body and associates with this ENDOSOME. Therefore, some drugs may have similar effects, but how much side effects on the human body really need to be carefully studied in order to show that this drug can be safely used in large areas.
Moderator: Yes, in fact these days around this medicine (Remdesivir), I think the latest hot spot is rather unexpected, but please also talk about Mr. Tang Jingyuan, the patent issue surrounding this medicine (Remdesivir). We see that the Wuhan Institute of Virology has registered this patent on January 21 that this drug can work on this coronavirus. But this drug was developed by an American company, so what is going on with this patent? What do you think of this?
Tang Jingyuan: I think this patent is actually a trick of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The patent they applied for was not actually for the drug (Remdesivir) itself. Because the drug itself was developed by an American company, it is impossible to grab it with such an open fire. The patent it applied for was a formula made by combining the drug Remdesivir with another drug called chloroquine phosphate. It said that this medicine had a certain effect on the disease of new coronary pneumonia (2019-nCoV), so the patent applied for refers to this formula. In other words, let’s make an analogy. If the medicine Remdesivir is a nutritious meatball, then the Chinese Academy of Sciences actually uses a high-level deceit, or a high-level theft. The Chinese Academy of Sciences took the medicine, brought the meatballs, and then I wrapped it with a thin layer of dough.
Moderator: Baozipi.
Tang Jingyuan: Then I called it Baozi, this is a dumpling, and then I applied for a patent. I am applying for a patent for this bun, or a patent for this dumpling. So in other words, it is a very clever technique, but everyone knows that you go to eat that bun, or eat the dumpling. The real thing is to eat that stuffing!
Moderator: Mainly that stuffing.
Tang Jingyuan: The most important thing is that stuffing. What really works is that stuffing. Because of this chloroquine phosphate they are combined. What kind of medicine is chloroquine phosphate? This medicine is mainly used to treat malaria. We know that the pathogen of malaria is Plasmodium, which is a parasite. Therefore, it is actually a completely different pathogen from the virus, so why does this chloroquine phosphate also have such an inhibitory effect on the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV)? This rationale has not been clear to even these experts. They are a bit like going for a test now. Anyway, I take this medicine out and try it, and then take another medicine and try it out. Maybe this is the kind.
Moderator: As long as it meets a little use, I will try it first.
Tang Jingyuan: Then there may be another situation that Mr. Xiao En mentioned just now. Some medicines are originally broad-spectrum, they suppress immunity, or they may have a certain degree of effect on certain basic principles of curing diseases in this body. However, it is “broad” but it cannot be “exclusive.” That is, it may have a little effect on this and it may have a little effect on that disease, but its effect is not very specific. It can’t reach such a degree, so at least we can see that it can really achieve special effects. It is the first case that was cured in the United States.
Moderator: Seattle.
Tang Jingyuan: This effect can be said to be very good, because according to the treatment report published by the United States, the whole is very detailed. This first patient took the drug on the evening of the 7th day (on the 7th day of the onset). On the eighth day, his symptoms improved significantly, and then some of his symptoms disappeared.
So from this case, the effect is indeed very good. However, there is indeed a problem. Although it has been greatly improved, the patient also had a positive virus response after testing the test strip made from his nasal cavity after the 12th day. So you seem that although the effect of this medicine on improving symptoms seems to be very good, it does not say that it can actually kill the virus, so its effect really needs further observation.
Whats going on at Wuhan’s Fangcai Hospital?
Moderator: Yes, and I think this patent is a problem. What I noticed was that it applied for a patent on January 21, and it was very anxious to apply for a patent. But on January 21, it did not try to give this medicine to the hospital to treat these patients, I think this is a very incomprehensible operation! that
There is still a little time, I quickly asked Mr. Xiao En, that we see the current situation in Wuhan, there is a new one is that they are going to build “square cabin hospitals” in some public places, which is also a concern that everyone pays attention to The thing is, can this hospital play a role? Then we saw that in the outgoing video, we saw that these beds are densely packed, so many people are worried that they will not cause more cross infections. What do you think of the “square cabin hospital”?
Xiao En: Actually, I think the local government should have used it earlier. Because, for example, the Spanish flu virus early in 1918, when people resisted the epidemic, they would see that when a large area of ​​people was infected, this approach was almost inevitable.
It is a large area that brings people together, especially people who have been diagnosed with the infection. One of the benefits of this is that many medical staff can help many people in a short time, and it has such benefits. But there is a risk of cross infection, but here is the trade-off! If you have a lot of infections and you are running around, the risk of infecting more people is even greater, so this is a practice in battlefield hospitals.
Then if you want to reduce the possibility of some cross-infection, that is, according to some operating rules of respiratory infectious diseases, you must basically ensure that the distance between the bed and the bed is at least about one meter, so that means cross-infection The probability will be reduced a lot. I also saw some pictures on the Internet. This design has some beds that are very close together. This is more worrying. But in general, this is a last resort, but I think this approach should be used by the government long before, even before the city is closed. Some people who are definitely diagnosed can be isolated in large areas.
Moderator: Yes, rather than letting them go home and isolate themselves, that is really too risky. Okay, thank you very much for the two comments today. The time for our show today is coming soon. We are also very grateful to our friends for watching. We will continue to pay attention to the development of the epidemic. See you next time!

Wuhan-400 Coronavirus – 1981 Novel Predicts Virus Origin,"In a bizarre coincidence, a 1981 fictional novel The Eyes of Darkness by Dean Koontz predicts a Coronavirus like outbreak and its origin. The book talks about how the virus called Wuhan-400, was developed in military labs around the Chinese city of Wuhan from where it got its name. The top secret information of the Biological  weapons Program is later acquired by US intelligence from a Chinese defector. The American military is ultimately successful in creating a vaccine which the Chinese could not.

The Eyes of Darkness is a thriller novel by American writer Dean Koontz, released in 1981. The book focuses on a mother who sets out on a quest to find out if her son truly did die one year ago, or if he is still alive.
Plot
A mother sends her son on a camping trip with a leader who has led this trip into the mountains 16 times before without mishap; that is until this time. Every single camper and leader and driver die with no explanation. As the grieving mother who is the protagonist begins to accept the fact that her son, Danny, is dead she starts getting vicious bully-like attacks from nowhere saying he is not dead, such as writing on chalk boards, words from printers and other various ‘signs’. Along with her new friend, Elliot Stryker, Christina Evans sets out to find out what could have possibly happened on the day that her son ‘died’.
Excerpts on Wuhan-400
To understand that you have to go back twenty months. It was around then that a Chinese scientist named Li Chen defected to the United States, carrying a diskette record of China’s most important and dangerous new biological weapon in a decade. They call the stuff “Wuhan-400” because it was developed at their RDNA labs outside of the city of Wuhan, and it was the four-hundredth viable strain of man-made microorganisms created at that research center.
Wuhan-400 is a perfect weapon. It afflicts only human beings. No other living creature can carry it. And like syphilis, Wuhan-400 can’t survive outside a living human body for longer than a minute, which means it can’t permanently contaminate objects or entire places the way anthrax and other virulent microorganisms can. And when the host expires, the Wuhan-400 within him perishes a short while later, as soon as the temperature of the corpse drops below eighty-six degrees Fahrenheit. Do you see the advantage of all this?
The Chinese could use Wuhan-400 to wipe out a city or a country, and then there wouldn’t be any need for them to conduct a tricky and expensive decontamination before they moved in and took over the conquered territory.
And Wuhan-400 has other, equally important advantages over most biological agents. For one thing, you can become an infectious carrier only four hours after coming into contact with the virus. That’s an incredibly short incubation period. Once infected, no one lives more than twenty-four hours. Most die in twelve. It’s worse than the Ebola virus in Africa – infinitely worse. Wuhan-400’s kill-rate is one hundred percent. No one is supposed to survive.

The Chinese tested it on God knows how many political prisoners. They were never able to find an antibody or an antibiotic that was effective against it. The virus migrates to the brain stem, and there it begins secreting a toxin that literally eats away brain tissue like battery acid dissolving cheesecloth. It destroys the part of the brain that controls all of the body’s autonomic functions. The victim simply ceases to have a pulse, functioning organs, or any urge to breathe.
After Li Chen defected with all the data on Wuhan-400, he was brought here (US military facility). We immediately began working with him, trying to engineer an exact duplicate of the virus. In relatively short order we accomplished that. Then we began to study the bug, searching for a handle on it that the Chinese had overlooked.
Someone got careless and stupid. Almost thirteen months ago, when the boys were on their winter survival outing, one of our scientists accidentally contaminated himself while he was working alone one morning in this lab.
You’re trained what to do from the day you start to work here. In the event of accidental contamination, you immediately set off an alarm. Immediately. Then you seal the room you’re working in. If there’s an adjoining isolation chamber, you’re supposed to go into it and lock the door after yourself. 
A decontamination crew moves in swiftly to clean up whatever mess you’ve made in the lab. And if you’ve infected yourself with something curable, you’ll be treated. If it’s not curable . . . you’ll be attended to in isolation until you die. That’s one reason our pay scale is so high. Hazardous-duty pay. The risk is part of the job.

GGI IMPACT: White House To Investigate If Coronavirus Was Weaponized,"As a direct impact of GreatGameIndia investigation on Coronavirus which found deadly viruses smuggled by Chinese Biowarfare agents from a Canadian lab to Wuhan, where it is believed Coronavirus was weaponized, now the White House has opened and investigation to determine if these findings are true and whether Coronavirus is indeed bio-engineered in a lab.

The White House on Thursday asked U.S. scientists and medical researchers comprising the White House Coronavirus Task Force to investigate the scientific origins of the novel coronavirus.
The director of the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), in a letter to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, requested that scientific experts “rapidly” look into the origins of the virus in order to address both the current spread and “to inform future outbreak preparation and better understand animal/human and environmental transmission aspects of coronaviruses.”
The director of the OSTP, Kelvin Droegemeier, wrote in the letter to the president of the National Academy of Sciences, Marcia McNutt, that a widely disputed paper on the origins — subsequently withdrawn — had shown the urgency for accurate information about the genesis of the outbreak.

“There’s always that concern,” Dr. Anthony Fauci said. “And one of the things that people are doing right now is very carefully looking at sequences to see if there’s even any possibility much less likelihood that that’s going on. And you could ultimately determine that. So people are looking at it, but right now, the focus is on what are we going to do about what we have.”
This investigation is in direct response to GreatGameIndia’s findings on Coronavirus, as Joshua Phillip puts it:
The original report making the claim about the P4 lab as a potential source was published by GreatGameIndia, a journal on geopolitics and international relations in its report Coronavirus Bioweapon. Other publications, such as The Washington Times, followed, with additional claims based on interviews.

— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 27, 2020

While the narrative of the virus coming from the lab hasn’t been debunked, it has been criticized by several news outlets.
Regardless of where the coronavirus came from, the attention on the P4 lab has focused a spotlight on the Chinese regime’s alleged biological warfare program and is raising questions about the nature of the P4 lab in Wuhan.
GreatGameIndia report has also been corroborated by Bioweapons expert Dr. Francis Boyle in an exclusive interview given to Geopolitics and Empire. Dr. Boyle drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, that was approved unanimously by both Houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.
Further to our investigation, recently in a very strage turn of events, renowned Canadian scientist Frank Plummer who received the Saudi SARS Coronavirus sample and was working on Coronavirus (HIV) vaccine in the Winnipeg based Canadian lab from where the virus was smuggled by Chinese Biowarfare agents and weaponized, has died in mysterious conditions. Frank Plummer was the key to the Chinese Biological Espionage case at Winnipeg’s National Microbiology Laboratory.
For the White House Coronavirus Task Force along with the Indian authorities probing the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a good place to launch the investigation would be Nairobi, Kenya, where Frank Plummer died.

Wuhan Institute Of Virology – Epicentre Of Coronavirus,"The source of the novel coronavirus that has led to the lockdown of 34 Chinese cities, and has now spread to 35 countries outside China, is still unknown. Initial reports from China claimed the source was a live food market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, and may have been caused by bats. Other reports claimed the source of Coronavirus may have been the state-run Wuhan Institute of Virology near the market, where the virus may have been leaked from the country’s first top-level “P4” lab, which handles the most dangerous types of pathogens.

The original report making the claim about the P4 lab as a potential source was published by GreatGameIndia, a journal on geopolitics and international relations in its report Coronavirus Bioweapon. Other publications, such as The Washington Times, followed, with additional claims based on interviews.
While the narrative of the virus coming from the lab hasn’t been debunked, it has been criticized by several news outlets, since some of the connections still aren’t proven.
Regardless of where the coronavirus came from, the attention on the P4 lab has focused a spotlight on the Chinese regime’s alleged biological warfare program and is raising questions about the nature of the P4 lab in Wuhan.
The main argument against the idea that the Chinese regime has a biological warfare program is the fact that China became a state party to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in 1984, which would forbid it from developing biological weapons.

How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized Ithttps://t.co/tc7W2DrmAA
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 27, 2020

A brief perusal of official documents and strategies, however, quickly fuels doubt about how closely the Chinese regime has followed the BWC. A U.S. State Department report from August 2019 notes the U.S. assessment that China had an offensive biological weapons program from at least the 1950s to the late 1980s, and despite signing the BWC, “there is no available information to demonstrate that China took steps to fulfill its treaty obligations” to “divert or destroy” any offensive biological weapons it previously developed.
The report also notes that the Chinese regime “engaged during the reporting period in biological activities with potential dual-use applications, which raises concerns regarding its compliance with the BWC.”
In other words, some research programs done by the Chinese regime could be used for both peaceful and hostile purposes. The report notes, “Available information on studies from researchers at Chinese military medical institutions often identify biological activities of a possibly anomalous nature … with potential dual-use applications.”
Rick Fisher, a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center and an Epoch Times contributor, said in an interview that U.S. assessments in the government and intelligence communities hold that “China has been developing these weapons all along.”
Fisher noted that it was suspected that biological warfare program in China were connected to leakages of the SARS virus, following its outbreak in 2002 and 2003, and to a viral outbreak in the late 1980s in Xinjiang.
“They are still disasters—breakdowns—in the process of these laboratories that allowed for these very harmful viruses to leak out into the public and cause extensive, but clearly unnecessary, death,” Fisher said.
The P4 lab in Wuhan has connections to the Chinese military, the People’s Liberation Army. When the U.S.-based company Gilead Sciences recently sent a new drug (remdesivir) to China that could possibly treat the novel coronavirus, the Wuhan Institute of Virology quickly moved to apply for a patent.
In a Feb. 4 statement published on the institute’s website about the patent, the institute notes it conducted research alongside the National Academy of Military Medical Research Institute of Emergency Medicine for Prevention and Control of Drugs. It also notes ties to the Prevention Engineering Technology Research Center of Military Medical Research Institute, and to the National Institute of Emergency Medicine Control and Engineering Research Center for Military Medical Research.
The Wuhan P4 lab is part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which has close ties to the Chinese military in its research programs.
Meanwhile, Chinese military doctrine has identified biological warfare as a key part of the regime’s military strategies—particularly in any war scenarios with the United States. Among the key programs is its Assassin’s Mace (“Sha Shou Jian”) strategy.
Michael Pillsbury, a Pentagon consultant, warned of the strategy in his 2016 book “The Hundred-Year Marathon,” in which he noted the only time China won in a simulated war game with the United States, the China team used the Assassin’s Mace strategy. He wrote, “whenever the China team used conventional tactics and strategies, America won—decisively. However, in every case where China employed Assassin’s Mace methods, China was the victor.”
Fisher said that Assassin’s Mace is designed around using various unconventional weapons in conjunction for a brutal surprise attack, and that “when used at the right time, and targeted against a specific weakness of the enemy, can result in the rapid collapse of that enemy’s military threat.”
He also noted that Chinese military officials haven’t shied away from discussing the use of brutal attacks and weapons, including biological weapons. Some of the statements are so brazen and extreme, however, that many in the U.S. defense analyst community tend to dismiss them.
In regard to rumors about the new coronavirus spreading in China, he noted that while they’re still unproven, they also shouldn’t be written off without some investigation.

“Reputable scientists are beginning to coalesce around the idea that at a minimum, the coronavirus that we’re facing today is the product of a laboratory [and] not the product of some kind of naturally occurring process,” Fisher said.
He said the “developing consensus that this coronavirus is a man-made virus naturally links this to China’s biowarfare capabilities and programs.”
“The world should take this as a very serious possibility, and it should affect our policy and relationships with the People’s Republic of China.”

Frank Plummer – Canadian Scientist Key To Coronavirus Investigation Assassinated In Africa?,"In a very strage turn of events, renowned scientist Frank Plummer who received Saudi SARS Coronavirus sample and was working on Coronavirus (HIV) vaccine in the Winnipeg based Canadian lab from where the virus was smuggled by Chinese Biowarfare agents and weaponized as revealed in GreatGameIndia investigation, has died in mysterious conditions. Frank Plummer was the key to the Chinese Biological Espionage case at Winnipeg’s National Microbiology Laboratory.

According to CBC, Plummer, 67, was in Kenya, where he was a keynote speaker at the annual meeting of the University of Nairobi’s collaborative centre for research and training in HIV/AIDS/STIs.
Dr. Larry Gelmon, who helped set up that meeting, said Plummer collapsed and was taken to hospital in Nairobi, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
No confirmed cause of death has yet been released.
Plummer was born and raised in Winnipeg, where he headed up Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory for several years.
He was also involved in an innovative research partnership between the University of Manitoba and the University of Nairobi, established before the world was very aware of HIV/AIDS.
“He helped to identify a lot of the key factors that are involved in HIV transmission in the early days,” said Keith Fowke, a professor in the medical microbiology and infectious diseases department at the University of Manitoba.
“He was so hopeful that he was on the path that would end with discovery of the HIV vaccine — the road he had started down almost 30 years ago,” said Plummer’s colleague, Dr. Allan Ronald.
What is not mentioned in the CBC report however is that Plummer worked in the same National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, Canada from where Chinese Biowarfare agent Xiangguo Qiu and her colleagues smuggled SARS Coronavirus to China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology where it is believed to have been weaponized and leaked.

Infact, as GreatGameIndia reported in our exclusive report on Coronavirus Bioweapon, as Scientific Director Frank Plummer was the one who acquired the SARS Coronavirus sample of the Saudi patient at the NML Winnipeg Lab from Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands who was sent the virus by Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki who isolated and identified a previously unknown type of Coronavirus from the Saudi patient’s lungs.
Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki using a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.
This Coronavirus sample arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab received by Frank Plummer. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus.
Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.
This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage. The viruses was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese Biowarfare agent Xiangguo Qiu and her colleagues and smuggled to none other than the Wuhan Institute of Virology where the virus is believed to be weaponized and leaked.
Further, Frank Plummer was also working on HIV vaccine and interesting recently published study be Indian scientists found HIV-like injections in Wuhan Coronavirus – the key that made the jump to people possible. The Indian Scientists came under massive online criticism by Social Media experts and were  forced to withdraw their study, in retaliation of which now the Indian authorities have opened an investigation against China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. Although it should be noted that now China has started using HIV vaccine to cure Coronavirus.
Frank Plummer was the key to the entire investigation on the origins of Coronavirus Bioweapon. But will the Canadian government open an investigation into this matter? Unlike their American counterparts who have charged the Chinese Biowarfare agents trying to smuggle deadly viruses from Harvard University, the deatils of the Canadian investigation on the Winnipeg Biological Espionage case is shrouded in secrecy.

TRANSCRIPT: Bioweapons Expert Dr. Francis Boyle On Coronavirus,"A recent interview with Bioweapons expert Dr. Francis Boyle published by GreatGameIndia and conducted by Geopolitics & Empire, has been exploding across the world the past few days as the truth is emerging on the origins of the Coronavirus Bioweapon.
Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, that was approved unanimously by both Houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.

In the exclusive interview, Dr. Boyle touches upon GreatGameIndia‘s exclusive report Coronavirus Bioweapon – where we reported in detail how Chinese Biowarfare agents working at the Canadian lab in Winnipeg were involved in the smuggling of Coronavirus to Wuhan’s lab from where it is believed to have been leaked.
In this bombshell interview (full transcript below), Boyle talks about:
The bioweapons origins of the coronavirus
How the Deep State deployed anthrax on US soil to whip up publicity about biological weapons and increase funding for bioweapons labs
Why the WHO and CDC are both criminal organizations which are complicit in the covert development of biological weapons
The “death science” industry and why the US government has spent over $100 billion developing self-replicating weapons
Details about the Pirbright Institute and its ties to bioweapons, depopulation, vaccines and coronavirus patents. (It’s partially funded by Bill & Melinda Gates)
Why all BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs in the world should be banned and shut down.
Full transcript
Geopolitics and Empire: Geopolitics & Empire is joined by Dr. Francis Boyle, who is international law professor at the University of Illinois. We’ll be discussing the Wuhan coronavirus and biological warfare. He’s served as counsel to numerous governments such as Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Palestinian authority. He’s represented numerous national international bodies in the areas of human rights, war crimes and genocide, nuclear policy, and biowarfare. He’s written numerous books, one of my favorites being “Destroying Libya and World Order”, which I assigned as mandatory reading material for my own students when I taught at the Monterrey Institute of Technology.
But most important for this interview, he’s written a book called “Biowarfare and Terrorism”, and drafted the US domestic implementing legislation for the biological weapons convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 that was approved unanimously by both houses of the US Congress and signed into law by President Bush. Thanks for joining us, Dr. Boyle.
Dr. Francis Boyle: Wow. Thank you so much for having me on and thanks for that kind introduction.
Geopolitics and Empire:  Now let’s get to what’s been on the news recently. This coronavirus in Wuhan. There have been some reports recently, there’s a really interesting website called GreatGameIndia that has been reporting on this. They’ve been talking about China, which they say has been complying with biological weapons convention in recent years.

But then there are some people in the US and experts that have been saying that in reality, China isn’t complying with the weapons convention. And I think neither, perhaps the US as well. I’m wondering if China is developing its own biosafety level four lab in Wuhan and elsewhere, as you know, as a type of deterrence. Is it a type of a biological arms race that we have going on?
You told me in an email that you suspect China was developing the coronavirus as a dual use of biowarfare weapons agent. Also, what do you make of reports that Chinese scientists have been stealing research and viruses, including the coronavirus from a Canadian bio lab this past December?
And as well, Chinese nationals have been charged with smuggling vials of biological research to China from the US with the aid of Charles Lieber who was the chair of Harvard’s chemistry department. And he also happens to be in 2011 a strategic scientist at Wuhan University. So, can you tell us what’s going on with this recent outbreak in Wuhan?
Dr. Francis Boyle: Well, that’s a lot of questions. I guess we can take them one at a time, but if you just do a very simple Google search on “Does China have a BSL-4 laboratory?”, Wuhan comes up right away. It’s at the top of the list. That’s all with the moment this type of thing happened I began to do that. So a BSL-4 is the most serious type. And basically BSL-4 labs, we have many of them here in the United States, are used to develop offensive biological warfare weapons with DNA genetic engineering.
So it does seem to me that the Wuhan BSL-4 is the source of the coronavirus. My guess is that they were researching SARS, and they weaponize it further by giving it a gain of function properties, which means it could be more lethal.
Indeed, the latest report now is it’s a 15% fatality rate, which is more than SARS at 83% infection rate. A typical gain of function travels in the air so it could reach out maybe six feet or more from someone emitting a sneeze or a cough. Likewise, this is a specially designated WHO research lab. The WHO was in on it and they knew full well what was going on there.
Yes. It’s also been reported that Chinese scientists stole coronavirus materials from the Canadian lab at Winnipeg. Winnipeg is Canada’s formal center for research, developing, testing, biological warfare weapons. It’s along the lines of Fort Detrick here in the United States of America. I have three degrees from Harvard. It would not surprise me if something was being stolen out of Harvard to turn over to China. I read that report. I don’t know what was in those vials one way or the other.
But the bottom line is I drafted the US domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention that was approved unanimously by both Houses in the United States Congress signed into law by President Bush Sr. that it appears the coronavirus that we’re dealing with here is an offensive biological warfare weapon that leaped out of Wuhan BSL-4. I’m not saying it was done deliberately. But there had been previous reports of problems with that lab and things leaking out of it. I’m afraid that is what we are dealing with today.

Geopolitics and Empire: We’ll be talking about the Wuhan and the coronavirus and China, but can you give us kind of like a bigger context. I know you’ve, previously, in interviews said that since 9/11, you think that the US has spent $100 billion on biological warfare research. We know the Soviet Union, if I’m not mistaken, developed anthrax as a bioweapon. And you’ve also mentioned that UK, France, Israel and China are all involved in biological warfare weapons research.
And something interesting, I believe one or two years ago a Bulgarian journalist and the Russian government shared their concern of the discovery of a US bioweapons lab in the country of Georgia. You’ve commented how in Africa, US has set up bioweapons labs to work on Ebola, which I think is illegal under international law. But they were allowed somehow to put those in Africa. Can you give us like a bigger picture? What’s going on with these different countries and what’s the purpose of this research?
Dr. Francis Boyle: All these BSL-4 labs are by United States, Europe, Russia, China, Israel are all there to research, develop, test biological warfare agents. There’s really no legitimate scientific reason to have BSL-4 labs. That figure I gave $100 billion, that was about 2015 I believe. I had crunched the numbers and came up with that figure the United States since 9/11.
To give you an idea that’s as much in constant dollars as the US spent to develop the Manhattan Project and the atom bomb. So it’s clearly all weapons related. We have well over 13,000 alleged life science scientists involved in research developed testing biological weapons here in the United States. Actually this goes back it even precedes 9/11 2001.
I have another book, The Future of International Law and American Foreign Policy, tracing that all the way back to the Reagan administration under the influence of the neocons and they got very heavily involved in research development testing of biological weapons with DNA genetic engineers. It was because of that I issued my plea in 1985 in a Congressional briefing sponsored by the Council for Responsible Genetics, I’m a lawyer for them. They’re headquartered in Cambridge, Mass. All the MIT, Harvard people are involved in that, the principal ones. And then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation.
The implementing legislation that I drafted was originally designed to stop this type of work. “Death science work”, I call it, “by the United States government”. After 9/11, 2001, it just completely accelerated. My current figure, that last figure a 100 billion. I haven’t had a chance to re-crunch the numbers because I just started classes. But you have to add in about another 5 billion per year.
Basically, this is offensive biological weapons raised by the United States government and with its assistance in Canada and Britain. And so other States, the world have responded accordingly including Russia and China. They were going to set up a whole series of BSL-4 facilities as well. And you know Wuhan was the first. It backfired on them.
Geopolitics and Empire: Would you basically consider what happened and Wuhan and just boil it down to ineptitude or incompetence on the Chinese part?
Dr. Francis Boyle: Well, it’s criminality. It does appear they stole something there from Winnipeg. This activity that they engaged in clearly violates the Biological Weapons Convention. Research development of biological weapons these days is an international crime, the use of it would be. That was criminal.
I’m not saying they deliberately inflicted this on their own people, but it leaked out of there and all these BSL-4 facilities leak. Everyone knows that who studies this. So this was a catastrophe waiting to happen. Unfortunately, it happened. The Chinese government under Xi and his comrades there have been covering this up from the get-go. The first reported case was December 1, so they’d been sitting on this until they couldn’t anymore. And everything they’re telling you is a lie. It’s propaganda.
The WHO still refuses to declare a global health emergency. It said Tedros was over there shaking hands with Xi and smiling and yanking it up. The WHO was in on it. They’ve approved many of these BSL-4 labs., they know exactly what’s going on and that is a WHO research-approved laboratory. They know what’s going on too. You can’t really believe anything the WHO is telling you about this, either they’re up to their eyeballs in it, in my opinion.
Geopolitics and Empire: I’d probably agree with you that this outbreak in Wuhan was an accidental leak from the laboratory. But just your thoughts, it’s happening at quite an opportune time because namely we’re smack in the middle of a US-China new Cold War, which is currently characterized by economic warfare such as the trade war among other forms of hybrid and technological warfare. And it seems the Wuhan outbreak will likely hit the Chinese economy hard. The Chinese are flat out dismissing any idea that the US is involved in. Like I said, it’s probably they made the mistakes in the Wuhan lab. What are your thoughts of any seemingly, this would benefit the US…
Dr. Francis Boyle: When the outbreak occurred, of course I considered that alternative too. When you have an outbreak, you’re never quite sure who or what is behind it. It certainly isn’t bats, that’s ridiculous. They made the same argument on Ebola in West Africa. I demolished that online. You can check it out. So I kept competing theories about this.
But right now, when you originally contacted me, I said I wasn’t prepared to comment because I was weighing the evidence. I’m a law professor and a lawyer,  I try to do the best I can to weigh the evidence. But right now, the Wuhan BSL-4 in my opinion is the most likely source, apply Occam’s razor, the simplest explanation. I’m not ruling out some type of sabotage. But right now, I believe that is the source here.
Geopolitics and Empire: And you mentioned WHO. I’d like to just get your thoughts on the WHO and the Big Pharma. There’s also some analysts who are downplaying this news media hype of the coronavirus. You’ve just said that it seems to be lethal, but if we go back a decade to the 2009 swine flu, which I believe didn’t have too many casualties, but I think profited greatly the pharmaceutical companies. If I recall that back in 2009, many countries purchased great stocks of the vaccines and they ended up not using anywhere from 50 to 80% of the vaccines that they purchased. 
You’ve previously stated in an interview that the World Health Organization is a front for Big Pharma if I’m not mistaken. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also agrees and he says, you know, 50% of WHO funding comes from pharmaceutical companies. And that the CDC itself is also severely compromised. What are your thoughts on the WHO? The CDC?
Dr. Francis Boyle: Can’t trust anything the WHO says because they’re all bought and paid for by Big Pharma and when they work in cahoots with the CDC, which is the United States government, they work in cahoots with Fort Detrick, so you can’t trust any of it.
However, the swine flu and yes, I agree pharma made a lot of money, but that swine flu which I looked at it, it did seem to me to be a genetically modified biological warfare weapon. It was a chimera of three different types of genetic strains that someone put it together in a cocktail. Fortunately, it was not as lethal as all of us fear. So fine. But as I said, this figure I just gave to you was Saturday from Lancet, which is a medical publication, saying it’s a 15% fatality rate and an 83% infection rate. So it’s quite serious, I think, far more serious than the swine flu.
As for big pharma, sure they’re all trying to profit off this today as we speak. There was a big article yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, all big pharma trying to peddle whatever they can over there in China even if it’s worthless and won’t help. We do know, if you read the mainstream news media they say there isn’t a vaccine.
Well, there is, it’s by the Pirbright Institute in Britain that’s tied into their biological warfare program over there. They were behind the hoof and mouth disease outbreak over there that wiped out their cattle herd and it leaked out of there. So it’s clear they’re working on a hoof and mouth biological warfare weapon, but the vaccine is there. I have the patent for it here, I haven’t had a chance to read the patent it’s about 25 pages long and my classes just resume. So eventually, I get some free time and I’ll read the patent.
You can’t patent a vaccine with the United States patent office unless the science is there. So there is a vaccine. Everyone’s lying about that, no one’s pointing this out – there’s a vaccine but instead big pharma wants to make money and the researchers say, well, it’ll take three months and we’re racing forward, you know. Everyone’s gonna make a buck off of this, that’s for sure. But there is a vaccine, I have the patent here. It’s been patented by the United States government.
So obviously, I don’t know exactly how workable it is, but it’s a vaccine. I don’t know why it isn’t out there now? Why isn’t someone saying there is a vaccine? Perhaps political leaders have already been vaccinated for all I know, I really don’t know.  But there is a vaccine, Pirbright is well known there in Britain and it’s tied into Fort Detrick and CDC is tied into Fort Detrick too. So they all know there’s a patented vaccine.
Geopolitics and Empire:  And just to get your comment on, I mean, something to related to this, which was my next question. So I think, I’m not sure if it’s that same Institute that you just mentioned that has the patent.  I read somewhere that the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation maybe funds or has some connection to that Institute that has the patent.
Dr. Francis Boyle:  I think they do. The Bill & Melinda Gates information, they fund this type of DNA genetically engineered biological warfare work. That’s correct. So you can’t trust anything they’re telling you that somehow they’re out there trying to make the world a better place.  I mean, we have Bill Gates publicly admitting that the world be a better place if there were a lot less people. So the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation, they are wolves in sheep’s clothing and they are funding this type of stuff. Sure.
Geopolitics and Empire: And just your comment, there was also the report that I guess it was a consortium of companies which included the Gates foundation that back in just two or three months ago in October of 2019 they held a pandemic exercise simulating an outbreak. I mean, what are the chances specifically of a coronavirus and it was called events 201. People can find this online online and they gave a list of seven recommendations for governments and international organizations to take. I also find that kind of interesting how they had this simulation.
Dr. Francis Boyle:  That’s correct. It raises that question,  the origins of what happened here.  But right now, I’m just looking at the evidence I have and applying Occam’s razor and we know that Wuhan BSL-4 was research developing, testing, SARS as a biological warfare agent. So it could have been, they gave it this DNA genetic engineering enhanced properties gain of function which we do here in the West, in the United States all the time. We have  all sorts of research that is clearly a bio warfare research that has been  approved by the National Institutes of Health, it’s a joke. They know full well they are proving all kinds of biological warfare research and it gets funded by the United States government.
Geopolitics and Empire:  And you’ve also mentioned in the email to me that what happened in the biosafety lab level 4 in Wuhan calls into question the safety of all of these level 3and 4four labs around the world.
Dr. Francis Boyle:  They’re complete unsafe. BSL-3 and BSL-4 lab are only designed for research development testing of offense of biological warfare agents.  In my opinion, they serve no legitimate purpose at all. They should all be shut down, every one of them. Even assuming, they’re simply too dangerous. If you want, there’s an excellent  documentary called Anthrax Wars by Nadler and Coen and I’m in there.  Repeatedly at the end, I say with respect to these labs, three and four, this is a catastrophe waiting to happen. Well, I’m afraid the catastrophe is now happened. So there it is.
Geopolitics and Empire:  Yeah, I was just watching that documentary before we connected and I recommend the listeners go check that out. Do you see, in the future, any countries,  if we come to a conflict between US, EU, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran, China, Russia,  I mean you name it. Do you see any of these countries actually utilizing these biological weapons?  I mean, it’s illegal under international law but we know like in the past that international law isn’t followed. Do you think that there’s a real danger of this escalating?
Dr. Francis Boyle: For sure. That’s the only reason they develop these biological weapons to eventually be used, sure.  I mean, it’s like the Manhattan project, we put all that money into developing an atom bomb and even though it was not needed to end world war II they still knew Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So, yes,  I think that’s correct.  And also these can be used covertly. Anytime you see an unexplained  sudden outbreak of a disease like this anywhere in the world, both for human beings and or animals, I always suspect the bio warfare agent is at work.  I monitor the situation like I did at Wuhan until I can reach a conclusion. Yes, they can be used as the eyes for the United States government, today they are fully prepared, armed, equipped, supplied to wage a biological warfare with anthrax.
These other more exotic things I don’t know, but they have the weapons, there are stockpiles. We have to understand if you read Seymour Martin Hersh’s book published about 1968, he won the Pulitzer prize, he had the whole offensive US biological warfare industry in there back before it was illegal and criminal. Basically after 9/11, 2001, that entire industry – offensive biological warfare industry has been reconstituted here in the United States with all these BSL-4 BSL-3 labs, well over 13,000, alleged scientists sort of like Dr. Mengele working on these things. Other countries have responded in kind like Russia, like China, France is involved, Britain’s involved. Sure.
Geopolitics and Empire: I just wanted to get your thoughts on, in the last few years there was the Russian double agent spy Sergei Skripal who had been allegedly poisoned with Novichok out in Britain and  I thought it was funny. It just so happened where he was allegedly poisoned, he was right in Porton down the British bio weapons lab, I guess the world’s first bio weapons lab that was created in 1916. I mean,  I don’t know if you have thoughts on that whole incident.
Dr. Francis Boyle: Yeah, I was right down the street from Porton Down, so applying Occam’s razor who you think might’ve been behind this and it was not a nerve agent. A nerve agent would have killed him immediately. This is Novichok. It was something else like DX or something like that. So fine. But, I would just say that I don’t think that was a coincidence, but, you know, there you go. There’s the, obviously there’s a lot of speculation on that.
Geopolitics and Empire: Something else that’s kind of interesting. You’ve written in bio warfare and terrorism in your book and there’s also Graeme Macqueen, I think your colleague who wrote the anthrax deception the case for domestic conspiracy…
Dr. Francis Boyle:  Everything you said in there. That’s correct.
Geopolitics and Empire:  I’m wondering also if this new war for biotechnological dominance, whatever you want to call it, if it can also be used kind of as a pretext for the centralization of political power and the initiation of wars like I guess it did in the 2003 Iraq war. I mean, is this another danger that we get these events like now this coronavirus and then governments will call for a centralization of greater power and taking away some of our civil liberties?
Dr. Francis Boyle:  Sure. If you look at the October, 2001 anthrax attacks here in the United States, that was clearly by elements of the United States government that was behind that. That was a super weapons grade anthrax with a trillion spores per gram and it floated in the air solely a very sophisticated biological weapons lab like Fort Detrick could produce that. And they use that anthrax attack including on Congress to brand through the USA Patriot act which basically turned the United States to a police state which is what we have now. You have to understand the Pentagon, Fort Dietrich made the dugway proving ground still has a stockpile of that super weapons grade anthrax that we saw in October of 2001 that they can use the next time they want to do something like that to further develop the American police thing. Right.
Geopolitics and Empire:  Is there anything else you feel important to mention regarding this Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak or biological warfare or any other thoughts you’d like to leave us with?
Dr. Francis Boyle:  Well, you just can’t believe anything the Chinese government, the WHO,  the CDC are telling. They’re all lies because they know what’s going on here  and so you’re going to have to figure it out as fast as you can. But in my opinion, as of this time and I’m fully prepared to consider further evidence on this, it does seem to me that this was  a DNA genetically engineered biological warfare agent leaking out of Wuhan that has gain-of-function properties which can make it more lethal.  I think they are probably doing something with SARS to make it a lot more lethal and more infectious. And so for that reason,  you have to take extreme precautions and they’re now finally admitted anyone within six feet can be infected, whereas with SARS that was about two feet. Well, that’s gaining a function right there and that should be a tip off.
So, I guess you’re gonna have to protect yourself.  Laurie Garrett had a pretty good essay in a foreign policy yesterday and she was over there covering the SARS and she has very good advice in there except that she took the SARS figure out two to three feet and said  well, you gotta stay to two to three. I think you’ve got to stay at least six feet away because this is gained function. It can flow through the air and infect and it can get you in the eyes. Any orifice, the mouth, maybe the ears, we’re not sure at this point.
Geopolitics and Empire: I’m here on the border of China in Kazakhstan and I was just reading yesterday – today that they’re no longer allowing Chinese citizens into Kazakhstan without a medical paper, a medical check to get their visas to enter Kazakhstan
Dr. Francis Boyle:  Those medical checks are worthless because this is just public relations by all the governments involved because there is a 14 day incubation period where people can still be infected. So someone could walk right through a medical inspection and passing a gate into your country and then they come down with the coronavirus.  So that’s all public relations in my opinion by governments and they know it and they’re just sending people out there with temperatures and things like that. It’s not like SARS, this is more dangerous than SARS.  As I said, I think that Wuhan lab, we know they had SARS in there that they were dealing with and I think they enhanced it at and  I’m afraid that’s what we’re dealing with. But you know, I’m keeping an open mind as to what other sources that might have and I wasn’t prepared to say anything until that Wuhan lab is right there and it’s dealing with coronavirus. So again, apply Occam’s razor. It seems to me that’s the simplest explanation here.
Geopolitics and Empire: I guess my, one of my final question would be in the months ahead, apart of what you say staying six feet away from people.  I’ve read taking high doses of vitamin C and other things like this can help you. But, if they come out as the situation develops and if it gets worse and they come out with a coronavirus vaccine,  should people take it or not? What are your thoughts?
Dr. Francis Boyle:  Well, what I would say is this. Right now, if you look at the article at the Wall Street Journal, big pharma is trying to sell all sorts of – they’re taking all their drugs off the shelf and say well let’s see if it works. Which is preposterous. Okay. The scientists are saying, well, we can get you a vaccine maybe two to three months but they’re not tested.  So what we do know, however, is that Pirbright vaccine has been patented. So all I can assume is that that might work. But I don’t think I’d be taking any of these other vaccines. No, you have no idea what’s in there. You’ll be the Guinea pig for big pharma and everyone figures they’re gonna make a lot of money here. So I’ll keep my eye open on this  and how it develop but I wouldn’t trust anything they’re trying to sell right now. They’re just pulling these things off the shelf.
If they do come up with something in two to three months, even that’s not going to be tested in accordance with normal scientific protocol. So it’s going to be a crap shoot. If it’s going to help you, indeed it might not help you because they’ll be using for this vaccines (these DNA genetic engineered vaccines) they’ll be using live coronavirus probably and sticking it in there and giving you some live coronavirus on the theory you’ll develop an immunity. That’s the way a lot of these vaccines worked out, that’s what happened with the Ebola vaccine that created the Ebola pandemic there in West Africa. They were testing out a vaccine on poor black Africans, as usual, and  this vaccine had live Ebola in it so it gave them Ebola. So again, I’d be very careful even if they do come up with these vaccines two to three months from now, very careful. Why would you want to inject the live coronavirus in you?
Geopolitics and Empire: All right. I don’t believe you have a strong online presence. How can people best follow your work? I suppose to search for interviews as well as get your books.
Dr. Francis Boyle: Well, basically I’m blackballed and blacklisted off all the mainstream news media here on purpose. As far as I can figure out, the US government gave an order that I should not be interviewed by anyone, so I’m not.  I guess you could just put my name in there under Google, Google alert, and some interviews might come up. What happened was, right after the anthrax attacks of 9/11 2001, I was giving a lecture out at Harvard m Alma Mater.  I was running a panel on biological warfare for the council for responsible genetics and it was at Harvard Divinity School and as I was going in, there was a Fox camera crew there from Boston and I said it looks to me like this has come out of the US government lab. We know they do research and testing on anthrax. Then I said the same thing there at Harvard then I gave an interview to a radio station in Washington, D C then I gave an interview on that to the BBC. So the whole world saw it and at that point I was completely cut off and I’ve been cut off  ever since. So you  probably not going to hear too many  interviews from me here. As for my book. Biowarfare & Terrorism, you can just get it at amazon.com. That picks up the story pretty much from 9/11 2001 and until it went to press and then there are interviews I’d given to an investigative reporter, Sherwood Ross and a big one I just sent you and you might want to put that on your web page. That was pretty comprehensive.
Geopolitics and Empire: Yeah,  I read that as well and I’ll include the link in the description of this interview so people can go check that out. You’re not the only academic I know and have heard of others that similar things have happened and that’s just I guess the price we pay for telling the truth. Again, for listeners, if people wanted to have a broader context and deeper understanding of what’s happening today especially with biological warfare as well as us foreign policy and international affairs, I urge you to get Dr. Francis Boyle’s books and listen to his interviews as well as his colleagues book. Graeme Macqueen, The Anthrax Deception, The Case For Domestic Conspiracy. Thank you for being with us, Dr. Boyle.
Dr. Francis Boyle: Well, thank you and again, please understand these are my current opinions.  I could change my opinion here based on more evidence. So  I’m just looking at the evidence out there as I see it and you have to understand there is so much disinformation, lies and propaganda that it’s kind of very difficult to distinguish truth from fact.  I’m doing the best job I can here.

Coronavirus : India To Investigate Wuhan Institute Of Virology,"After Indian scientists were forced to withdraw their study concluding Coronavirus was injected with HIV AIDS virus amidst massive online criticism from Social Media experts, now Indian authorities have launched an investigation against China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology.
EXCLUSIVE: Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It (watch here Visualizing The Secret History Of Coronavirus)
Watch the exclusive interview of Bioweapons Expert Dr. Francis Boyle on Coronavirus Biological Warfare blocked by the Deep State
The Indian government has ordered an inquiry into a study conducted in the Northeastern state of Nagaland (close to China) by researchers from the U.S., China and India on bats and humans carrying antibodies to deadly viruses like Ebola, officials confirmed to The Hindu.
The study came under the scanner as two of the 12 researchers belonged to the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Department of Emerging Infectious Diseases, and it was funded by the United States Department of Defense’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). They would have required special permissions as foreign entities.
The study, conducted by scientists of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in the U.S. and the Duke-National University in Singapore, is now being investigated for how the scientists were allowed to access live samples of bats and bat hunters (humans) without due permissions.

— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) February 6, 2020

The results of the study were published in October last year in the PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases journal, originally established by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
Bill Gates, the man who tops the Forbes richest person in the world list had issued a grave warning about a potential Coronavirus-like catastrophe that could kill 30 million people at the Munich Security Conference held in Germany in 2017:
“Whether it occurs by a quirk of nature or at the hand of a terrorist, epidemiologists say a fast-moving airborne pathogen could kill more than 30 million people in less than a year. And they say there is a reasonable probability the world will experience such an outbreak in the next 10 to 15 years.”
“The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) sent a five-member committee to investigate. The inquiry is complete, and a report has been submitted to the Health Ministry,” a senior government official told The Hindu.
The U.S. Embassy and the Union Health Ministry declined to comment on the inquiry. In a written reply to questions from The Hindu, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta said it “did not commission this study and had not received any enquiries [from the Indian government] on it.” An American official, however, suggested that the U.S. Department of Defense might not have coordinated the study through the CDC.
The study, ‘Filovirus-reactive antibodies in humans and bats in Northeast India imply Zoonotic spillover’, published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases states the researchers found “the presence of filovirus (e.g. ebolavirus, marburgvirus and dianlovirus) reactive antibodies in both human (e.g. bat hunters) and bat populations in Northeast India, a region with no historical record of Ebola virus disease.”
It adds: “Ebola has posed a global health threat several times, most notably from 2013 to 2016. It is a deadly disease, with a fatality rate of roughly 50 percent.” Now, according to health officials, 2019-nCoV, too, has acquired the ability to pass between people and can do so before symptoms appear.
The Nagaland study suggests bats in South Asia act as a reservoir host of a diverse range of filoviruses, and filovirus spillover occurs through human exposure to these bats. For the study done in 2017, 85 individuals participating in an annual bat harvest at Mimi, Nagaland, were picked. The majority of bat hunters were male, aged between 18 and 50, and participated at least eleven times in the harvest. The study says the potential virus present in the bats may not be an exact copy of the virus responsible for various outbreaks.
Given the widespread challenges from the newly discovered viruses, officials say they want to take no chance on their spread and will take action to ensure all medical studies in the country adhere to strict norms.
Indian military believes that the U.S. Center for Disease Control in Atlanta was involved in the 1994 plague in the Indian city of Surat which killed 52 people and close to a quarter of the city’s citizens fled the area for fear of being quarantined. Even the origin of 1994 plague is mired in controversy to this day.

R. Prasannan, the New Delhi Bureau Chief of The Week magazine, in his piece questioning whether Coronavirus was created in a lab wrote,
During the 1994 plague outbreak in Surat and Beed, it was found that the germs had an extra protein ring which could only have been inserted artificially. Indian scientists had raised concerns about a US biowar experiment having gone awry. THE WEEK had carried reports giving details of germ war reseach being carried on in labs under the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta and about a newly developed germ detector being tested. The US embassy had denied the allegations. There were also reports that the Surat germ could have been developed in a lab in Almaty, Kazakhstan.
Mr. Prasannan is one of many experts from different fields who have raised doubts over the narrative being paddled by certain sections of the media. Among them is American Senator Tom Cotton who questioned mainstream media’s narrative on the origin of 2019 Wuhan Coronavirus, instead hinting that a biosafety laboratory in Wuhan working with the deadliest pathogens in the world could be the true source.
Even Dr. Francis Boyle who drafted the Biological Weapons Act in an explosive  interview said that the 2019 Wuhan Coronavirus is an offensive Biological Warfare Weapon and that the World Health Organization (WHO) already knows about it.

Dr. Francis Boyle Creator Of BioWeapons Act Says Coronavirus Is Biological Warfare Weapon,"In an explosive interview Dr. Francis Boyle, who drafted the Biological Weapons Act has given a detailed statement admitting that the 2019 Wuhan Coronavirus is an offensive Biological Warfare Weapon and that the World Health Organization (WHO) already knows about it.
EXCLUSIVE: Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It (watch here Visualizing The Secret History Of Coronavirus)
Watch the exclusive interview of Bioweapons Expert Dr. Francis Boyle on Coronavirus Biological Warfare blocked by the Deep State
Francis Boyle is a professor of international law at the University of Illinois College of Law. He drafted the U.S. domestic implementing legislation for the Biological Weapons Convention, known as the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, that was approved unanimously by both Houses of the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush.
In an exclusive interview given to Geopolitics and Empire, Dr. Boyle discusses the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China and the Biosafety Level 4 laboratory (BSL-4) from which he believes the infectious disease escaped. He believes the virus is potentially lethal and an offensive biological warfare weapon or dual-use biowarfare weapons agent genetically modified with gain of function properties, which is why the Chinese government originally tried to cover it up and is now taking drastic measures to contain it. The Wuhan BSL-4 lab is also a specially designated World Health Organization (WHO) research lab and Dr. Boyle contends that the WHO knows full well what is occurring.
Dr. Boyle also touches upon GreatGameIndia‘s exclusive report Coronavirus Bioweapon – where we reported in detail how Chinese Biowarfare agents working at the Canadian lab in Winnipeg were involved in the smuggling of Coronavirus to Wuhan’s lab from where it is believed to have been leaked.

YouTube has blocked Dr. Francis Boyle’s interview for speaking out the truth. The interview could be watched below:

Dr. Boyle’s position is in stark contrast to the mainstream media’s narrative of the virus being originated from the seafood market, which is increasingly being questioned by many experts.
Recently, American Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas also dismantled the mainstream media’s claim on Thursday that pinned the coronavirus outbreak on a market selling dead and live animals.
In a video accompanying his post, Cotton explained that the Wuhan wet market (which Cotton incorrectly referred to as a seafood market) has been shown by experts to not be the source of the deadly contagion.
Cotton referenced a Lancet study which showed that many of the first cases of the novel coronavirus, including patient zero, had no connection to the wet market — devastatingly undermining mainstream media’s claim.
“As one epidemiologist said: ‘That virus went into the seafood market before it came out of the seafood market.’ We still don’t know where it originated,” Cotton said.
“I would note that Wuhan also has China’s only bio-safety level four super laboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.”
China claimed—for almost two months—that coronavirus had originated in a Wuhan seafood market. That is not the case. @TheLancet  published a study demonstrating that of the original 40 cases, 14 of them had no contact with the seafood market, including Patient Zero. pic.twitter.com/PdgqgHjkGy

Such concerns have also been raised by J.R. Nyquist, the well known author of the books “Origins of the Fourth World War” and “The Fool and His Enemy,” as well as co-author of “The New Tactics of Global War”. In his insightful article he published secret speechs given to high-level Communist Party cadres by Chinese Defense Minister Gen. Chi Haotian explaining a long-range plan for ensuring a Chinese national renaissance – the catalyst for which would be China’s secret plan to weaponiz viruses.
Nyquist gave three different data points for making his case in analyzing Coronavirus. He writes:
The third data point worth considering: the journal GreatGameIndia has published a piece titled “Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It.”

The authors were clever enough to put Khan’s Virology Journal article together with news of a security breach by Chinese nationals at the Canadian (P4) National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg, where the novel coronavirus was allegedly stored with other lethal organisms. Last May, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were called in to investigate; by late July the Chinese were kicked out of the facility. The chief Chinese scientist (Dr. Xiangguo Qiu) was allegedly making trips between Winnipeg and Wuhan.
Here we have a plausible theory of the NCoV organism’s travels: first discovered in Saudi Arabia, then studied in Canada from whence it was stolen by a Chinese scientist and brought to Wuhan. Like the statement of Taiwan’s intelligence chief in 2008, the GreatGameIndia story has come under intensive attack. Whatever the truth, the fact of proximity and the unlikelihood of mutation must figure into our calculations.

It’s highly probable that the 2019-nCoV organism is a weaponized version of the NCoV discovered by Saudi doctors in 2012.
Meanwhile, the mainstream media’s narrative still maintains that the origin of the 2019 Coronavirus is the Wuhan Seafood Market. After GreatGameIndia published the story on Coronavirus Bioweapon – not only were our databse tinkered with and our reports blocked by Facebook on the flimsy reason that they could not find GreatGameIndia Facebook page, but the report itself was viciously attacked by Foreign Policy magazine, PolitiFact (known widely as Facebook’s propaganda arm) and BuzzFeedNews.
It is not GreatGameIndia alone which is being viciously attacked. Zero Hedge, a popular alternate media blog was suspended by Twitter for publishing a story related to a study by Indian scientists finding 2019 Wuhan Coronavirus to be not naturally evolved, raising the possibility of it being created in a lab. Shockingly, the study itself came under intense online criticism by Social Media experts resulting in the scientists withdrawing the paper.
In retaliation India has launched a full-scale investigation against China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology. The Indian government has ordered an inquiry into a study conducted in the Northeastern state of Nagaland (close to China) by researchers from the U.S., China and India on bats and humans carrying antibodies to deadly viruses like Ebola.

The study came under the scanner as two of the 12 researchers belonged to the Wuhan Institute of Virology’s Department of Emerging Infectious Diseases, and it was funded by the United States Department of Defense’s Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA).
The study, conducted by scientists of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, the National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in the U.S. and the Duke-National University in Singapore, is now being investigated for how the scientists were allowed to access live samples of bats and bat hunters (humans) without due permissions.
The results of the study were published in October last year in the PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases journal, originally established by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
As the author J.R. Nyquist puts it:
We must have an investigation of the outbreak in Wuhan. The Chinese must grant the world total transparency. The truth must come out. If Chinese officials are innocent, they have nothing to hide. If they are guilty, they will refuse to cooperate.
The real concern here is whether the rest of the world has the courage to demand a real and thorough investigation. We need to be fearless in this demand and not allow “economic interests” to play a coy and dishonest game of denial. We need an honest inquiry. We need it now.

Now, Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas has dismantled the mainstream  media’s claim on Thursday that pinned the coronavirus outbreak on a market selling dead and live animals.
“China claimed — for almost two months — that coronavirus had originated in a Wuhan seafood market,” Cotton wrote on Twitter. “That is not the case.”
In a video accompanying his post, Cotton explained that the Wuhan wet market (which Cotton incorrectly referred to as a seafood market) has been shown by experts to not be the source of the deadly contagion.
Cotton referenced a Lancet study which showed that many of the first cases of the novel coronavirus, including patient zero, had no connection to the wet market — devastatingly undermining mainstream media’s claim.
“As one epidemiologist said: ‘That virus went into the seafood market before it came out of the seafood market.’ We still don’t know where it originated,” Cotton said.
“I would note that Wuhan also has China’s only bio-safety level four super laboratory that works with the world’s most deadly pathogens to include, yes, coronavirus.”

Cotton appears to be referring to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the China’s foremost virus research facility. The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory, which is part of the institute, is located only 20 miles from the Wuhan wet market, the “official” source of the outbreak according to China.
This lab as we pointed out in our earlier reports is where Chinese Biowarfare agent Dr. Xiangguo Qiu was collaborating. Qiu has been dismissed from a Canadian lab where she was working, which is under investigation for sending deadly viruses to China’s Wuhan lab. This is part of China’s Thousand Talents Plan initiated to steal western technologies.
To top it all, more Chinese Biowarfare agents were caught smuggling deadly viruses, this time from Harvard University. Yet, the mainstream  media would have you believe otherwise, instead of making the details of the Canadian investigation public.

Coronavirus – China’s Secret Plan To Weaponize Viruses,"In a secret speech given to high-level Communist Party cadres nearly two decades ago, Chinese Defense Minister Gen. Chi Haotian explained a long-range plan for ensuring a Chinese national renaissance.
EXCLUSIVE: Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It (watch here Visualizing The Secret History Of Coronavirus)

He said there were three vital issues that must be grasped. The first was the issue of living space—because China is severely overpopulated and China’s environment is deteriorating. The second issue, therefore, is that the Communist Party must teach the Chinese people to “go out.” By this Gen. Chi meant the conquest of new lands in which a “second China” could be built by “colonization.” From this arises the third vital issue: the “issue of America.”
Gen. Chi warned his listeners: “This appears to be shocking, but the logic is actually very simple.” China is “in fundamental conflict with the Western strategic interest.” Therefore, the United States will never allow China to seize other countries to build a second China. The United States stands in China’s way.
Chi explained the problem as follows: “Would the United States allow us to go out to gain new living space? First, if the United States is firm in blocking us, it is hard for us to do anything significant to Taiwan, Vietnam, India, or even Japan, [so] how much more living space can we get? Very trivial! Only countries like the United States, Canada, and Australia have the vast land to serve our need for mass colonization.”
“We are not as foolish as to want to perish together with America by using nuclear weapons,” said the general. “Only by using non-destructive weapons that can kill many people will we be able to reserve America for ourselves.” The answer is found in biological weapons. “Of course,” he added, “we have not been idle, in the past years we have seized the opportunity to master weapons of this kind.”
The ruling Chinese Communist Party considers biological weapons to be the most important weapons for accomplishing their goal of “cleaning up America.” Chi credits Deng Xiaoping with putting biological weapons ahead of all other weapon systems in the Chinese arsenal: “When Comrade Xiaoping was still with us, the Party Central Committee had the perspicacity to make the right decision not to develop aircraft carrier groups and focus instead on developing lethal weapons that can eliminate mass populations of the enemy country.”

It may seem difficult to believe, but Gen. Chi considered himself to be a “humanitarian” communist, and therefore admitted to mixed personal feelings on this matter: “I sometimes think how cruel it is for China and the United States to be enemies. …” After all, he noted, the United States helped China in World War II. Chinese people remember that the United States opposed Japanese imperialism. But none of that matters now.
“In the long run,” said Gen. Chi, “the relationship of China and the United States is one of a life-and-death struggle.” This tragic situation must be accepted. According to Gen. Chi, “We must not forget that the history of our civilization repeatedly has taught us that one mountain does not allow two tigers to live together.”
According to Gen. Chi, China’s overpopulation problem and environmental degradation will eventually result in social collapse and civil war. General Chi estimated that “more than 800 million” Chinese would die in such a collapse. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party has no policy alternative.
Either the United States is “cleaned up” by biological attacks, or China suffers national catastrophe.
Chi makes the following argument: “We must prepare ourselves for two scenarios. If our biological weapons succeed in the surprise attack, the Chinese people will be able to keep their losses at a minimum in the fight against the United States. If, however, the attack fails and triggers a nuclear retaliation from the United States, China would perhaps suffer a catastrophe in which more than half of its population would perish. That is why we need to be ready with air defense systems for our big and medium-sized cities.”
In his speech, Gen. Chi provides us with a key for understanding China’s development strategy. According to Chi, “Our economic development is all about preparing for the needs of war!” It’s not about improving the life of Chinese people in the short run. It’s not about building a consumer-oriented capitalist society. “Publicly, said Gen, Chi, “we still emphasize economic development as our center, but in reality, economic development has war as its center!”
The same can be said for China’s intense interest in the biological sciences.
Weaponizing Viruses
The West has yet to grasp the underlying motive for China’s ready participation in the West’s P4 microbiology labs, where the world’s most deadly microbes are studied (i.e., pathogen lethality level 4 labs). This now bubbles to the surface in the novel coronavirus pandemic that has occurred in Wuhan, at the heart of China, just outside China’s principle P4 virology lab (specializing in deadly viruses).
Not long after delivering his speech, Gen. Chi stepped down as Defense Minister in 2003, the same year as the SARS (coronavirus) outbreak in China. This was also (coincidentally) the same year Beijing decided to build the Wuhan P4 virology lab. Given Gen. Chi’s speech, is the novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan an accident occasioned by weaponizing the virus at the city’s P4 microbiology lab?
Three data points are worth considering. First, in 2008 Taiwan’s top security official told lawmakers that “Taiwan had intelligence linking the SARS virus to research done in Chinese labs,” according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Given China’s economic clout and political infiltration of Chinese-language media, it’s not surprising that National Security Bureau Director Tsai Chao-ming was forced to retract his statement, which had none of the usual features of a “gaffe.” Was Director Tsai forced to retract a statement that was true, since he could not reveal his intelligence sources inside China?
The second data point worth considering: The Virology Journal has an article by Gulfaraz Khan, published on Feb. 28, 2013, outlining the discovery of a novel coronavirus in Saudi Arabia in June 2012. Yes, it’s the very same coronavirus with the following difference: When first discovered it couldn’t be readily transmitted from human to human. Something changed in the virus since that time. Thus, the Wuhan version is labeled 2019-nCoV instead of simply NCoV. The latter is not contagious, while the former is spreading rapidly through China as these words are written.
What do you suppose changed its transmissibility between 2012 and 2020? Random mutation or weaponization? (This question has now been answered by Indian scientists who discovered Coronavirus was engineered with HIV AIDS like insertions.) If the current lethal outbreak had occurred in any other city than Wuhan, we might be inclined to believe in a random mutation. But Wuhan is ground zero for Chinese bioweapons. Should we credit such a coincidence?
The third data point worth considering: the journal GreatGameIndia has published a piece titled “Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It.”

Last May, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were called in to investigate; by late July the Chinese were kicked out of the facility. The chief Chinese scientist (Dr. Xiangguo Qiu) was allegedly making trips between Winnipeg and Wuhan.

Indian Scientists Discover Coronavirus Engineered With HIV (AIDS) Like Insertions,"A group of Indian scientists have discovered that Wuhan Coronavirus has been engineered with AIDS like insertions. The study concludes that it is unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time. Meanwhile, China has started using AIDS drug for Coronavirus treatment.

Indian Scientists Discover Coronavirus Engineered With AIDS Like InsertionsThe study was undertaken by scientists from Indian Institute of Technology, Acharya Narendra Dev College and University of Delhi and has been published under the title Uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag.
The study found 4 new AIDS like insertions in the Coronavirus which were absent from other Coronaviruses. This finding the study states is “unlikely to be fortuitous in nature”, meaning that it is not a naturally occurring phenomenon.
We are currently witnessing a major epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag.
Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity /similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature. This work provides yet unknown insights on 2019-nCoV and sheds light on the evolution and pathogenicity of this virus with important implications for diagnosis of this virus.
The scientists were surprised to observe such insertions and were startled “as it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time”.
Since the S protein of 2019-nCoV shares closest ancestry with SARS GZ02, the sequence coding for spike proteins of these two viruses were compared using MultiAlin software. We found four new insertions in the protein of 2019-nCoV- “GTNGTKR” (IS1), “HKNNKS” (IS2), “GDSSSG” (IS3) and “QTNSPRRA” (IS4). 
To our surprise, these sequence insertions were not only absent in S protein of SARS but were also not observed in any other member of the Coronaviridae family (Supplementary figure). This is startling as it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time.
The study concludes that it is because of these 4 new AIDS like insertions that Wuhan Coronavirus has jumped to humans originally known only to infect animals.
These proteins are critical for the viruses to identify and latch on to their host cells and for viral assembly. Since surface proteins are responsible for host tropism, changes in these proteins imply a change in host specificity of the virus. According to reports from China, there has been a gain of host specificity in case 2019-nCoV as the virus was originally known to infect animals and not humans but after the mutations, it has gained tropism to humans as well.
The study gives credence to GreatGameIndia‘s earlier reports on Coronavirus Bioweapon. Meanwhile, China has started using AIDS drugs for Coronavirus treatment. China is using AbbVie Inc’s HIV drugs as an ad-hoc treatment for pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus while the global search for a cure continues.

The Beijing branch of China’s National Health Commission said that a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, sold under the brand name Kaletra by AbbVie, is part of its latest treatment plan for patients infected by the virus, which has killed at least 56 people in China and sickened more than 2,000 worldwide.
The NHC said that while there is not yet any effective anti-viral drug, it recommends patients are given two lopinavir and ritonavir tablets twice a day and a dose of alpha-interpheron through nebulization twice daily.
Medical journal Lancet said on Friday that a clinical trial is under way using ritonavir and lopinavir to treat cases of the new coronavirus. Meanwhile, China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention will start developing a vaccine, according to the Global Times.
Wang Guangfa, a respiratory expert at Peking University First Hospital in Beijing who was infected by the virus after visiting Wuhan to inspect to coronavirus patients, told China News Week earlier this week that his doctor recommended he take the HIV drugs to fight the new virus and they worked on him.

The Beijing branch of China’s National Health Commission said that a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir, sold under the brand name Kaletra by AbbVie, is part of its latest treatment plan for patients infected by the virus, which has killed at least 56 people in China and sickened more than 2,000 worldwide.
The NHC said that while there is not yet any effective anti-viral drug, it recommends patients are given two lopinavir and ritonavir tablets twice a day and a dose of alpha-interpheron through nebulization twice daily.
Medical journal Lancet said on Friday that a clinical trial is under way using ritonavir and lopinavir to treat cases of the new coronavirus. Meanwhile, China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention will start developing a vaccine, according to the Global Times.
Wang Guangfa, a respiratory expert at Peking University First Hospital in Beijing who was infected by the virus after visiting Wuhan to inspect to coronavirus patients, told China News Week earlier this week that his doctor recommended he take the HIV drugs to fight the new virus and they worked on him.

A group of Indian scientists have discovered that Wuhan Coronavirus has been engineered with AIDS like insertions. The study concludes that it is unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time.
The study was undertaken by scientists from Indian Institute of Technology, Acharya Narendra Dev College and University of Delhi and has been published under the title Uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag.
The study found 4 new AIDS like insertions in the Coronavirus which were absent from other Coronaviruses. This finding the study states is “unlikely to be fortuitous in nature”, meaning that it is not a naturally occurring phenomenon.
The scientists were surprised to observe such insertions and were startled “as it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time”. The study concludes that it is because of these 4 new AIDS like insertions that Wuhan Coronavirus has jumped to humans originally known only to infect animals.
The study gives credence to GreatGameIndia‘s earlier reports on Coronavirus Bioweapon.

Abstract
We are currently witnessing a major epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein (S) which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity /similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature. This work provides yet unknown insights on 2019-nCoV and sheds light on the evolution and pathogenicity of this virus with important implications for diagnosis of this virus.
Introduction
Coronaviruses (CoV) are single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses that infect animals and humans. These are classified into 4 genera based on their host specificity: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus (Snijder et al., 2006). There are seven known types of CoVs that includes 229E and NL63 (Genus Alphacoronavirus), OC43, HKU1, MERS and SARS (Genus Betacoronavirus). While 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1 commonly infect humans, the SARS and MERS outbreak in 2002 and 2012 respectively occurred when the virus crossed-over from animals to humans causing significant mortality (J. Chan et al., n.d.; J. F. W. Chan et al., 2015). In December 2019, another outbreak of coronavirus was reported from Wuhan, China that also transmitted from animals to humans. This new virus has been temporarily termed as 2019-novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO) (J. F.- W. Chan et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020). While there are several hypotheses about the origin of 2019-nCoV, the source of this ongoing outbreak remains elusive.
The transmission patterns of 2019-nCoV is similar to patterns of transmission documented in the previous outbreaks including by bodily or aerosol contact with persons infected with the virus. Cases of mild to severe illness, and death from the infection have been reported from Wuhan. This outbreak has spread rapidly distant nations including France, Australia and USA among others. The number of cases within and outside China are increasing steeply. Our current understanding is limited to the virus genome sequences and modest epidemiological and clinical data. Comprehensive analysis of the available 2019- nCoV sequences may provide important clues that may help advance our current understanding to manage the ongoing outbreak.
The spike glycoprotein (S) of cornonavirus is cleaved into two subunits (S1 and S2). The S1 subunit helps in receptor binding and the S2 subunit facilitates membrane fusion (Bosch et al., 2003; Li, 2016). The spike glycoproteins of coronoviruses are important determinants of tissue tropism and host range. In addition the spike glycoproteins are critical targets for vaccine development (Du et al., 2013). For this reason, the spike proteins represent the most extensively studied among coronaviruses. We therefore sought to investigate the spike glycoprotein of the 2019-nCoV to understand its evolution, novel features sequence and structural features using computational tools.
Methodology
Retrieval and alignment of nucleic acid and protein sequences
We retrieved all the available coronavirus sequences (n=55) from NCBI viral genome database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and we used the GISAID (Elbe & Buckland-Merrett, 2017) [https://www.gisaid.org/] to retrieve all available full-length sequences (n=28) of 2019-nCoV as on 27 Jan 2020. Multiple sequence alignment of all coronavirus genomes was performed by using MUSCLE software (Edgar, 2004) based on neighbour joining method. Out of 55 coronavirus genome 32 representative genomes of all category were used for phylogenetic tree development using MEGAX software (Kumar et al., 2018). The closest relative was found to be SARS CoV. The glycoprotein region of SARS CoV and 2019-nCoV were aligned and visualized using Multalin software (Corpet, 1988). The identified amino acid and nucleotide sequence were aligned with whole viral genome database using BLASTp and BLASTn. The conservation of the nucleotide and amino acid motifs in 28 clinical variants of 2019-nCoV genome were presented by performing multiple sequence alignment using MEGAX software. The three dimensional structure of 2019-nCoV glycoprotein was generated by using SWISS-MODEL online server (Biasini et al., 2014) and the structure was marked and visualized by using PyMol (DeLano, 2002).
Results
Uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag
Our phylogentic tree of full-length coronaviruses suggests that 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS CoV [Fig1]. In addition, other recent studies have linked the 2019-nCoV to SARS CoV. We therefore compared the spike glycoprotein sequences of the 2019-nCoV to that of the SARS CoV (NCBI Accession number: AY390556.1). On careful examination of the sequence alignment we found that the 2019- nCoV spike glycoprotein contains 4 insertions [Fig.2]. To further investigate if these inserts are present in any other corona virus, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the spike glycoprotein amino acid sequences of all available coronaviruses (n=55) [refer Table S.File1] in NCBI refseq (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) this includes one sequence of 2019-nCoV[Fig.S1]. We found that these 4 insertions [inserts 1, 2, 3 and 4] are unique to 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses analyzed. Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses . Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses (Zhou et al., 2020).
We then analyzed all available full-length sequences (n=28) of 2019-nCoV in GISAID (Elbe & Buckland-Merrett, 2017) as on January 27, 2020 for the presence of these inserts. As most of these sequences are not annotated, we compared the nucleotide sequences of the spike glycoprotein of all available 2019-nCoV sequences using BLASTp. Interestingly, all the 4 insertions were absolutely (100%) conserved in all the available 2019- nCoV sequences analyzed [Fig.S2, Fig.S3].
We then translated the aligned genome and found that these inserts are present in all Wuhan 2019-nCoV viruses except the 2019-nCoV virus of Bat as a host [Fig.S4]. Intrigued by the 4 highly conserved inserts unique to 2019-nCoV we wanted to understand their origin. For this purpose, we used the 2019-nCoV local alignment with each insert as query against all virus genomes and considered hits with 100% sequence coverage. Surprisingly, each of the four inserts aligned with short segments of the Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) proteins. The amino acid positions of the inserts in 2019-nCoV and the corresponding residues in HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 Gag are shown in Table 1. The first 3 inserts (insert 1,2 and 3) aligned to short segments of amino acid residues in HIV-1 gp120. The insert 4 aligned to HIV-1 Gag. The insert 1 (6 amino acid residues) and insert 2 (6 amino acid residues) in the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV are 100% identical to the residues mapped to HIV-1 gp120. The insert 3 (12 amino acid residues) in 2019 nCoV maps to HIV-1 gp120 with gaps [see Table 1]. The insert 4 (8 amino acid residues) maps to HIV-1 Gag with gaps.
Although, the 4 inserts represent discontiguous short stretches of amino acids in spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV, the fact that all three of them share amino acid identity or similarity with HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 Gag (among all annotated virus proteins) suggests that this is not a random fortuitous finding. In other words, one may sporadically expect a fortuitous match for a stretch of 6-12 contiguous amino acid residues in an unrelated protein. However, it is unlikely that all 4 inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein fortuitously match with 2 key structural proteins of an unrelated virus (HIV-1). The amino acid residues of inserts 1, 2 and 3 of 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein that mapped to HIV-1 were a part of the V4, V5 and V1 domains respectively in gp120 [Table 1]. Since the 2019-nCoV inserts mapped to variable regions of HIV-1, they were not ubiquitous in HIV-1 gp120, but were limited to selected sequences of HIV-1 [ refer S.File1] primarily from Asia and Africa.
The HIV-1 Gag protein enables interaction of virus with negatively charged host surface (Murakami, 2008) and a high positive charge on the Gag protein is a key feature for the host-virus interaction. On analyzing the pI values for each of the 4 inserts in 2019-nCoV and the corresponding stretches of amino acid residues from HIV-1 proteins we found that a) the pI values were very similar for each pair analyzed b) most of these pI values were 10±2 [Refer Table 1]. Of note, despite the gaps in inserts 3 and 4 the pI values were comparable. This uniformity in the pI values for all the 4 inserts merits further investigation.
As none of these 4 inserts are present in any other coronavirus, the genomic region encoding these inserts represent ideal candidates for designing primers that can distinguish 2019-nCoV from other coronaviruses.
To get structural insights and to understand the role of these insertions in 2019-nCoV glycoprotein, we modelled its structure based on available structure of SARS spike glycoprotein (PDB: 6ACD.1.A). The comparison of the modelled structure reveals that although inserts 1,2 and 3 are at non-contiguous locations in the protein primary sequence, they fold to constitute the part of glycoprotein binding site that recognizes the host receptor (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016) (Figure 4). The insert 1 corresponds to the NTD (N-terminal domain) and the inserts 2 and 3 correspond to the CTD (C-terminal domain) of the S1 subunit in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. The insert 4 is at the junction of the SD1 (sub domain 1) and SD2 (sub domain 2) of the S1 subunit (Ou et al., 2017). We speculate, that these insertions provide additional flexibility to the glycoprotein binding site by forming a hydrophilic loop in the protein structure that may facilitate or enhance virus-host interactions.
Evolutionary Analysis of 2019-nCoV
It has been speculated that 2019-nCoV is a variant of Coronavirus derived from an animal source which got transmitted to humans. Considering the change of specificity for host, we decided to study the sequences of spike glycoprotein (S protein) of the virus. S proteins are surface proteins that help the virus in host recognition and attachment. Thus, a change in these proteins can be reflected as a change of host specificity of the virus. To know the alterations in S protein gene of 2019-nCoV and its consequences in structural re-arrangements we performed in-sillico analysis of 2019-nCoV with respect to all other viruses. A multiple sequence alignment between the S protein amino acid sequences of 2019-nCoV, Bat-SARS-Like, SARS-GZ02 and MERS revealed that S protein has evolved with closest significant diversity from the SARS-GZ02 (Figure 1).
Insertions in Spike protein region of 2019-nCoV
Since the S protein of 2019-nCoV shares closest ancestry with SARS GZ02, the sequence coding for spike proteins of these two viruses were compared using MultiAlin software. We found four new insertions in the protein of 2019-nCoV- “GTNGTKR” (IS1), “HKNNKS” (IS2), “GDSSSG” (IS3) and “QTNSPRRA” (IS4) (Figure 2). To our surprise, these sequence insertions were not only absent in S protein of SARS but were also not observed in any other member of the Coronaviridae family (Supplementary figure). This is startling as it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time.
Insertions share similarity to HIV
The insertions were observed to be present in all the genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV virus available from the recent clinical isolates (Supplementary Figure 1). To know the source of these insertions in 2019-nCoV a local alignment was done with BLASTp using these insertions as query with all virus genome. Unexpectedly, all the insertions got aligned with Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1). Further analysis revealed that aligned sequences of HIV-1 with 2019-nCoV were derived from surface glycoprotein gp120 (amino acid sequence positions: 404-409, 462-467, 136-150) and from Gag protein (366-384 amino acid) (Table 1). Gag protein of HIV is involved in host membrane binding, packaging of the virus and for the formation of virus-like particles. Gp120 plays crucial role in recognizing the host cell by binding to the primary receptor CD4.This binding induces structural rearrangements in GP120, creating a high affinity binding site for a chemokine co-receptor like CXCR4 and/or CCR5.
Discussion
The current outbreak of 2019-nCoV warrants a thorough investigation and understanding of its ability to infect human beings. Keeping in mind that there has been a clear change in the preference of host from previous coronaviruses to this virus, we studied the change in spike protein between 2019-nCoV and other viruses. We found four new insertions in the S protein of 2019-nCoV when compared to its nearest relative, SARS CoV. The genome sequence from the recent 28 clinical isolates showed that the sequence coding for these insertions are conserved amongst all these isolates. This indicates that these insertions have been preferably acquired by the 2019-nCoV, providing it with additional survival and infectivity advantage. Delving deeper we found that these insertions were similar to HIV-1. Our results highlight an astonishing relation between the gp120 and Gag protein of HIV, with 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein. These proteins are critical for the viruses to identify and latch on to their host cells and for viral assembly (Beniac et al., 2006). Since surface proteins are responsible for host tropism, changes in these proteins imply a change in host specificity of the virus. According to reports from China, there has been a gain of host specificity in case 2019-nCoV as the virus was originally known to infect animals and not humans but after the mutations, it has gained tropism to humans as well.
Moving ahead, 3D modelling of the protein structure displayed that these insertions are present at the binding site of 2019-nCoV. Due to the presence of gp120 motifs in 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein at its binding domain, we propose that these motif insertions could have provided an enhanced affinity towards host cell receptors. Further, this structural change might have also increased the range of host cells that 2019-nCoV can infect. To the best of our knowledge, the function of these motifs is still not clear in HIV and need to be explored. The exchange of genetic material among the viruses is well known and such critical exchange highlights the risk and the need to investigate the relations between seemingly unrelated virus families.
Conclusions
Our analysis of the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV revealed several interesting findings: First, we identified 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein that are not present in any other coronavirus reported till date. To our surprise, all the 4 inserts in the 2019-nCoV mapped to short segments of amino acids in the HIV-1 gp120 and Gag among all annotated virus proteins in the NCBI database. This uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019- nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag is unlikely to be fortuitous. Further, 3D modelling suggests that atleast 3 of the unique inserts which are non-contiguous in the primary protein sequence of the 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein converge to constitute the key components of the receptor binding site. Of note, all the 4 inserts have pI values of around 10 that may facilitate virus-host interactions. Taken together, our findings suggest unconventional evolution of 2019-nCoV that warrants further investigation. Our work highlights novel evolutionary aspects of the 2019-nCoV and has implications on the pathogenesis and diagnosis of this virus.

Chinese Biological Espionage at Harvard University
The US Department of Justice announced on January 28, 2020 that the Chair of Harvard University’s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department and two Chinese nationals have been charged in connection with aiding the People’s Republic of China.
Dr. Charles Lieber, 60, Chair of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University, was arrested and charged by criminal complaint with one count of making a materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement.
Yanqing Ye, 29, a Chinese national, was charged in an indictment with one count each of visa fraud, making false statements, acting as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy. Ye is currently in China.
Zaosong Zheng, 30, a Chinese national, was arrested on Dec. 10, 2019, at Boston’s Logan International Airport and charged by criminal complaint with attempting to smuggle 21 vials of biological research to China. On Jan. 21, 2020, Zheng was indicted on one count of smuggling goods from the United States and one count of making false, fictitious or fraudulent statements.  He has been detained since Dec. 30, 2019.
Dr. Charles Lieber
According to court documents, since 2008, Dr. Lieber who has served as the Principal Investigator of the Lieber Research Group at Harvard University, which specialized in the area of nanoscience, has received more than $15,000,000 in grant funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Department of Defense (DOD). These grants require the disclosure of significant foreign financial conflicts of interest, including financial support from foreign governments or foreign entities.
Unbeknownst to Harvard University beginning in 2011, Lieber became a “Strategic Scientist” at Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in China and was a contractual participant in China’s Thousand Talents Plan from in or about 2012 to 2017.  China’s Thousand Talents Plan is one of the most prominent Chinese Talent recruit plans that are designed to attract, recruit, and cultivate high-level scientific talent in furtherance of China’s scientific development, economic prosperity and national security.
These talent programs seek to lure Chinese overseas talent and foreign experts to bring their knowledge and experience to China and reward individuals for stealing proprietary information. Under the terms of Lieber’s three-year Thousand Talents contract, WUT paid Lieber $50,000 USD per month, living expenses of up to 1,000,000 Chinese Yuan (approximately $158,000 USD at the time) and awarded him more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab at WUT.
In return, Lieber was obligated to work for WUT “not less than nine months a year” by “declaring international cooperation projects, cultivating young teachers and Ph.D. students, organizing international conference[s], applying for patents and publishing articles in the name of” WUT.
The complaint alleges that in 2018 and 2019, Lieber lied about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and affiliation with WUT.  On or about, April 24, 2018, during an interview with investigators, Lieber stated that he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program, but he “wasn’t sure” how China categorized him.
In November 2018, NIH inquired of Harvard whether Lieber had failed to disclose his then-suspected relationship with WUT and China’s Thousand Talents Plan. Lieber caused Harvard to falsely tell NIH that Lieber “had no formal association with WUT” after 2012, that “WUT continued to falsely exaggerate” his involvement with WUT in subsequent years, and that Lieber “is not and has never been a participant in” China’s Thousand Talents Plan.
Yanqing Ye
According to the indictment, Ye is a Lieutenant of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), the armed forces of the People’s Republic of China and member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). On her J-1 visa application, Ye falsely identified herself as a “student” and lied about her ongoing military service at the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), a top military academy directed by the CCP.
It is further alleged that while studying at Boston University’s (BU) Department of Physics, Chemistry and Biomedical Engineering from October 2017 to April 2019, Ye continued to work as a PLA Lieutenant completing numerous assignments from PLA officers such as conducting research, assessing U.S. military websites and sending U.S. documents and information to China.

According to court documents, on April 20, 2019, federal officers interviewed Ye at Boston’s Logan International Airport. During the interview, it is alleged that Ye falsely claimed that she had minimal contact with two NUDT professors who were high-ranking PLA officers. However, a search of Ye’s electronic devices demonstrated that at the direction of one NUDT professor, who was a PLA Colonel, Ye had accessed U.S. military websites, researched U.S. military projects and compiled information for the PLA on two U.S. scientists with expertise in robotics and computer science.
Furthermore, a review of a WeChat conversation revealed that Ye and the other PLA official from NUDT were collaborating on a research paper about a risk assessment model designed to decipher data for military applications.  During the interview, Ye admitted that she held the rank of Lieutenant in the PLA and admitted she was a member of the CCP.
Zaosong Zheng
In August 2018, Zheng entered the United States on a J-1 visa and conducted cancer-cell research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston from Sept. 4, 2018, to Dec. 9, 2019. It is alleged that on Dec. 9, 2019, Zheng stole 21 vials of biological research and attempted to smuggle them out of the United States aboard a flight destined for China.
Federal officers at Logan Airport discovered the vials hidden in a sock inside one of Zheng’s bags, and not properly packaged. It is alleged that initially, Zheng lied to officers about the contents of his luggage, but later admitted he had stolen the vials from a lab at Beth Israel. Zheng stated that he intended to bring the vials to China to use them to conduct research in his own laboratory and publish the results under his own name.
Thousand Talents Plan
The Thousand Talents Plan or Thousand Talents Program was established in 2008 by the central government of China to recognize and recruit leading international experts in scientific research, innovation, and entrepreneurship – in other words to steal western technology.

Scholars or Spies
China’s drives to recruit scholars and technology experts are a primary channel for harvesting US technologies and intellectual property, stated a June 2018 White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy document.
At an April 2018 hearing titled “Scholars or Spies”, organized by two subcommittees of the US House of Representatives, the commissioner of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Michael Wessel, advised Congress to cut federal grants, loans or other assistance to participants of the Thousand Talents Plan. China has put “sleeper agents at our research universities to steal our scientific breakthroughs,” said Representative Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, at the hearing.
Curious case of Chinese Biological Espionage at the Canadian lab
Similar case of Chinese Biological Espionage was busted at Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory prompting a full-fledged investigation along with the dismissal of Chinese agents. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to China’s Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.

Curiously unlike the American investigation, Canadian authorities have been tight-lipped aboot the whole incident with details about the case still not fully revealed.
Facebook lies and blocks GreatGameIndia
After the publication of GreatGameIndia‘s story on Coronavirus Bioweapon, suspicious activity was observed tinkering with our database bringing the site down for a couple of days. Once restored the story published in full in one of the world’s largest Chinese TV News Network – NTDTV, The Week Magazine and numerous publications around the world. Then, Facebook sprung into action to block further awareness of the information.

The false and malicious lie being spread by Facebook says that they could not find GreatGameIndia’s Facebook page and that the information is missing. This is a ridiculous and laughable claim since our page is still active and Facebook itself have on many occasions been involved in a financial transaction with GreatGameIndia for marketing purposes.
This is no surprise given Mark Zuckerberg’s history of forgetting crucial information when grilled by authorities worldwide. So, we would just like to remind How Facebook’s Secret Unit created India’s Troll Armies for Digital Propaganda to Influence Elections.

Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It,"Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.
Note: The findings of this investigation has been corroborated by none other than the Bioweapons expert Dr. Francis Boyle who drafted the Biological Weapons Convention Act followed by many nations. The report has caused a major international controversy and is suppressed actively by a section of mainstream media.

The Saudi SARS Sample
On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke.
Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from his lungs. After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice. 
Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki. Fouchier used a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.
This Coronavirus sample was acquired by Scientific Director Dr. Frank Plummer (key to Coronavirus investigation Frank Plummer was recently assassinated in Africa) of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg directly from Fouchier, who received it from Zaki. This virus was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese agents.

The Canadian Lab
Coronavirus arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus.
Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.
NML has a long history of offering comprehensive testing services for coronaviruses. It isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus and identified another coronavirus NL63 in 2004.
This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage.
Chinese Biological Espionage
In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. Scientists from NML said the highly lethal viruses were a potential bio-weapon.
Following investigation, the incident was traced to Chinese agents working at NML. Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory (NML). The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.

Xiangguo Qiu – The Chinese Bio-Warfare Agent
The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu. Qiu was the head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.
Xiangguo Qiu is an outstanding Chinese scientist born in Tianjin. She primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens. 
But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses in Canada’s NML. The viruses shipped from the NML to China were studied by her in 2014, for instance (together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra).
Infiltrating the Canadian Lab
Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML, specifically the “Science and Technology Core”. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology. The couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program, namely:
Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region
Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei
Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing
All of the above four mentioned Chinese Biological Warfare facilities collaborated with Dr. Xiangguo Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 (originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006), against Ebola and additional viruses.
However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons development in case Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein.
The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.
Dr. Xiangguo Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
The Wuhan Coronavirus
Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility.
Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus.
The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed at the Chinese military facility Wuhan Institute of Virology linked to China’s Biological Warfare Program. It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 (BSL-4) standards – the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens. 
In January 2018, the lab was operational ‘for global experiments on BSL-4 pathogens,’ wrote Guizhen Wu in the journal Biosafety and Health. ‘After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,’ wrote Guizhen Wu.
Coronavirus Bioweapon
The Wuhan institute has studied coronaviruses in the past, including the strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, H5N1 influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the germ that causes anthrax – a biological agent once developed in Russia.
“Coronaviruses (particularly SARS) have been studied in the institute and are probably held therein,” said Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biowarfare. He said. “SARS is included within the Chinese BW program, at large, and is dealt with in several pertinent facilities.”
James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in Biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized. 
That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine. “This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.”
China’s Biological Warfare Program
In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production.
China's Biological Warfare Program is believed to include full range of traditional chemical & biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles. #coronarovirus https://t.co/7qpDNNmqk7
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 25, 2020

China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post.
Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination.
China’s Biological Warfare Program is believed to be in an advanced stage that includes research and development, production and weaponization capabilities. Its current inventory is believed to include the full range of traditional chemical and biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles.
Weaponizing Biotech
China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge.
Weaponizing Biotech – China's War for Biological Dominance#coronoavirushttps://t.co/MEVQ5VERJw
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 25, 2020

The PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology.
In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness. The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development.
In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank, which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics, and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of Biotechnology Warfare.
Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”

China’s War for Biological Dominance
We may be on the verge of a brave new world indeed. Today’s advances in biotechnology and genetic engineering have exciting applications in medicine — yet also alarming implications, including for military affairs. China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion (军民融合) has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge.
The PLA’s keen interest is reflected in strategic writings and research that argue that advances in biology are contributing to changing the form or character (形态) of conflict. For example:
In 2010’s War for Biological Dominance (制生权战争), Guo Jiwei (郭继卫), a professor with the Third Military Medical University, emphasizes the impact of biology on future warfare.
In 2015, then-president of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences He Fuchu (贺福初) argued that biotechnology will become the new “strategic commanding heights” of national defense, from biomaterials to “brain control” weapons. Maj. Gen. He has since become the vice president of the Academy of Military Sciences, which leads China’s military science enterprise.
Biology is among seven “new domains of warfare” discussed in a 2017 book by Zhang Shibo (张仕波), a retired general and former president of the National Defense University, who concludes: “Modern biotechnology development is gradually showing strong signs characteristic of an offensive capability,” including the possibility that “specific ethnic genetic attacks” (特定种族基因攻击) could be employed.
The 2017 edition of Science of Military Strategy (战略学), a textbook published by the PLA’s National Defense University that is considered to be relatively authoritative, debuted a section about biology as a domain of military struggle, similarly mentioning the potential for new kinds of Chinese biological warfare to include “specific ethnic genetic attacks.”
These are just a few examples of an extensive and evolving literature by Chinese military scholars and scientists who are exploring new directions in military innovation.
Following these lines of thinking, the PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology.
Gene Editing
Meanwhile, China has been leading the world in the number of trials of the CRISPR gene-editing technology in humans. Over a dozen clinical trials are known to have been undertaken, and some of these activities have provoked global controversy. It’s not clear whether Chinese scientist He Jiankui, may have received approval or even funding from the government for editing embryos that became the world’s first genetically modified humans.
The news provoked serious concerns and backlash around the world and in China, where new legislation has been introduced to increase oversight over such research. However, there are reasons to be skeptical that China will overcome its history and track record of activities that are at best ethically questionable, or at worst cruel and unusual, in healthcare and medical sciences.

But it is striking how many of China’s CRISPR trials are taking place at the PLA General Hospital, including to fight cancer. Indeed, the PLA’s medical institutions have emerged as major centers for research in gene editing and other new frontiers of military medicine and biotechnology.
The PLA’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences, or AMMS, which China touts as its “cradle of training for military medical talent,” was recently placed directly under the purview of the Academy of Military Science, which itself has been transformed to concentrate on scientific and technological innovation. This change could indicate a closer integration of medical science with military research.
In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness.
The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development.
AI + Biotech
The intersection of biotechnology and artificial intelligence promises unique synergies. The vastness of the human genome — among the biggest of big data — all but requires AI and machine learning to point the way for CRISPR-related advances in therapeutics or enhancement.
In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank (国家基因库), which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics (生物信息学), and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of biotechnology.

The effort is administered by BGI, formerly known as Beijing Genomics Inc., which is Beijing’s de facto national champion in the field. BGI has established an edge in cheap gene sequencing, concentrating on amassing massive amounts of data from a diverse array of sources. The company has a global presence, including laboratories in California and Australia.
U.S. policymakers have been concerned, if not troubled, by the company’s access to the genetic information of Americans. BGI has been pursuing a range of partnerships, including with the University of California and with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia on human genome sequencing. BGI’s research and partnerships in Xinjiang also raise questions about its linkage to human rights abuses, including the forced collection of genetic information from Uighurs in Xinjiang.
There also appear to be links between BGI’s research and military research activities, particularly with the PLA’s National University of Defense Technology. BGI’s bioinformatics research has used Tianhe supercomputers to process genetic information for biomedical applications, while BGI and NUDT researchers have collaborated on several publications, including the design of tools for the use of CRISPR.
Biotech’s Expansive Frontier
It will be increasingly important to keep tabs on the Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare, guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.” Although the use of CRISPR to edit genes remains novel and nascent, these tools and techniques are rapidly advancing, and what is within the realm of the possible for military applications may continue to shift as well. In the process, the lack of transparency and uncertainty of ethical considerations in China’s research initiatives raise the risks of technological surprise.

History
A combination of past and present geostrategic factors distinctly affect the Chinese approaches and outlooks with regard to Biological Warfare. The first major factor is the relapsing Japanese Biological Warfare attacks against and human Biological Warfare experimenting on Chinese populations, which took place from 1933 to 1945, killing and injuring tens of thousands, without the Chinese being able to cope or retaliate.
The employment of Biological Warfare against the Chinese by the Japanese military had a long-lasting impact in China. The Chinese official news agency, Xinhua, reported in 2002, that ‘at least 270,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians were slaughtered by Japanese germ-warfare troops between 1933 and 1945’, according to an ‘in-depth study by Chinese and Japanese scholars.’
The second factor is the Chinese belief (whether sound or unsound) that the United States (US) conducted Biological Warfare offensive operations in China (and North Korea) during the Korean War (1950–53), alongside with the evident fact that between 1950 and 1972, the US possessed an operational Biological Warfare arsenal.
The third factor concerns the then Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). Allegedly, near the end of World War II, USSR conducted experiments with plague, anthrax and cholera in Soviet-occupied Mongolia. Later on, tests with various vaccines were conducted by the USSR in Mongolia for a long period of time, concomitantly with the persisting communist brotherhood between China and USSR and their strategic cooperation in general, and Chinese awareness and following (to a certain extent) of the colossal Biological  Warfare program run by the USSR in particular.
A comprehensive study of the aspects pertaining to those geostrategic factors was published in 1999—entitled China and Weapons of Mass Destruction: Implications for the United States—within the framework of a conference ponsored by the US National Intelligence Council and Federal Research Division.
Collectively, these solidly formed Chinese perspectives shaped the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) approaches and outlooks pertaining to Biological Warfare, and yielded, naturally, a wide Chinese Biological Warfare Program which still persists fully viably—if appreciably concealed—and comprises both defensive and offensive sub-programs. Often located and working conjunctively, each of the two sub-programs, however, constitutes a strategically distinct entity.
Biological Weapons Convention
China joined the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) in 1984, 12 years after the Convention was opened for signature by the international community. From 1998 to 2009, two waves expressing China’s declared attitude to the BWC can be observed.
The first one, from 1998 to 2002, was apparently a result of increasing accusations made by the US in regard to an ongoing offensive Biological Warfare Program conducted by Beijing. Unsurprisingly, the first wave China generated within that context begun with a ‘Joint Statement on Biological Weapons Convention’, issued by Presidents Jiang Zemin and Bill Clinton during the Sino-US summit meeting that took place in China in June 1998, as follows:
Recognizing the threat posed by biological and toxin weapons, the United States and China reaffirm their strong support for the complete global elimination of biological weapons. As States Parties to the Biological Weapons Convention, the two sides stress the importance of the Convention to international peace and security, fully support the purposes and objectives of the Convention, and favor comprehensively strengthening the effectiveness and universality of the Convention.
Various further steps were taken by China, so as to manifest a supportive—if not entirely favourable—attitude towards the BWC. In its 17 October 2002 announcement on the promulgation of ‘Regulations on Export Control of Dual-use Biological Agents and Related Equipment and Technologies’, China stated that it ‘has never developed, produced or stockpiled any biological weapons, and never assisted any country to acquire or develop these weapons.’

— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) February 6, 2020

The second wave coincides with the period 2006 to 2009, widely accentuated by Chinese diplomacy with respect to the BWC. Once again, so it seems, this was in response to accumulating American accusations regarding an ongoing Biological Warfare Program run by China.
The aspect of widening cooperation among state parties was largely pointed at as well by China, in 2007:
All States Parties should make full use of the Convention as an important platform to strengthen cooperation and communication, promote implementation and other capacity of the Convention. China believes that adopting effective national implementation measures in accordance with the Convention and respective national situations constitutes basic obligations for the States Parties, as well as the important prerequisite and guarantee for effective implementation of all articles of the Convention.
In a white paper on China’s National Defence issued in 2008 by the Chinese State Council, the chapter on arms control and disarmament emphasized adherence to the BWC:
China observes in good faith its obligations under the BWC, and supports the multilateral efforts aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of the Convention. China has actively participated in the meetings of the parties to the Convention and the meetings of experts in a pragmatic manner. China has already established a comprehensive legislation system for the implementation of the Convention, set up a national implementation focal point, and submitted its declarations regarding confidence-building measures to the Implementation Support Unit of the Convention in a timely fashion.
In 2009, China accentuated its approach concerning Article X of the BWC, noting, ‘All provisions including Article X of the Convention are equally important and should be fully implemented. To strengthen international cooperation helps improve the implementation capability of States Parties, promote the effectiveness of the Convention and finally enhance the universalization of the Convention.’
China also referred, in 2009, to the aspect of tackling the spread of hazardous infectious diseases as being closely related to the objectives of the BWC: ‘Information about any outbreak of acute infectious diseases should be shared in accordance with the current practice of relevant international organizations.’
The SARS Epidemic
Although the latter constitutes a self-evident rule for long, the opposite conduct was exhibited by China from November 2002—when a sever acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic broke out in the country—till February 2003, when China reported it for the first time to the World Health Organization (WHO), disclosing the seriously threatening event (the causative virus spread from China to 37 countries) during three months.
China declared that there is only one biohazard installation with maximal safety level (P4) throughout the country, although this is doubtful. Uniquely, across China, and officially, the Wuhan Institute of Virology is the sole facility that is equipped with such biohazard measure, furnished by a French supplier. The Institute investigates highly virulent viruses, such as SARS14, influenza H5N115, Japanese encephalitis16, and dengue. Besides this, the germ causing anthrax is studied at the Institute too (which is beyond the discipline of virology).
During the last five years, China has reiterated various BWC aspects and declarations it had previously mentioned, as described. All in all, its diplomacy regarding the BWC is consistent and noticeably in favour of the Convention. And yet, it stands in contradiction to the China’s Biological Warfare Program, which is both defensive and offensive.
At any rate, China legitimately adheres, outwardly, to the requirements posed by the BWC in terms of defensive profile and biosecurity implementation. The relevance and characteristics of those aspects in relation to China have been discussed in detail, fairly professionally, by senior Chinese scientists within two notable reviews, forming, nevertheless, a screen of vagueness over the core components of China’s Biological  Warfare Program, especially those dealing with bio-weaponry.
Rise of China’s Biological Warfare Program
During the Korean War (1950–53), the earliest semblance of routinized defence against Biological Warfare in the PLA were the 1952 sanitation/anti-plague units, formed through the involvement of the Chinese People’s Volunteer Army in Korea. At the same time, intensive educational campaigns to rid disease-carrying pests were conducted, combined with experience of supposed Biological Warfare casualties treated during the Korean War.
Consequently, in 1954, PLA delegations and students visited the USSR for training in microbiology and infectious diseases. Officially, China declared that its BWs defence programme was initiated in 1958. It was based on a network of anti-plague stationary and mobile facilities (similar to the Soviet one), aiming to cope with plague and further hazardous infectious diseases.
The defensive programme had considerably been evolving during the 1960s, while an offensive Biological Warfare program was initiated in conjunction. By the mid-1970s, a comprehensive, orderly defensive alignment had been already operating within China’s Biological Warfare Program, while an effective offensive BW program was run concurrently.
The latter was formed as an outcome of the influential geostrategic factors mentioned earlier, yet, presumably, was no less a result of an innate Chinese will to possess an arm of high strategic value, in terms of sub-nuclear weapons of mass destruction (WMD). Such motive seems to typically reside in the Chinese national outlook regarding nearly any advanced weaponry.
China acceded to the BWC in 1984, but in a report entitled Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control Agreements, the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency contended: ‘China maintained an offensive biological weapons program throughout the 1980s. The program included the development, production, stockpiling or other acquisition or maintenance of biological warfare agents.’
The Pentagon also published a similar paper, entitled ‘Proliferation: Threat and Response’, which claimed that China’s Biological Warfare Program includes manufacturing of infectious microorganisms and toxins. In 1993, US intelligence officials stated that it was highly probable that China had an active and expanding offensive BWs program, following assessment that two civilian-run biological research centers were actually controlled by the Chinese military.
The research centres were known to have engaged previously in production and storage of BW. The American suspicions intensified in 1991 when one of the suspected biological centres was enlarged. Suspicions heightened further after Beijing made, according to a US official, a ‘patently false’ declaration to the United Nations (UN) that it had never made any germ weapons or conducted any work to bolster defences against a biological attack.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry subsequently described all this as groundless, denying that China had a germ weapons programme. In 1995, President Clinton transmitted to the US Congress his statutory annual report, Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control Agreements. On China, it said:
 ‘[T]here are strong indications that China probably maintains its offensive BW program.’ In its Chemical and Biological Defense Program Annual Report and the Chemical and Biological Defense Program Performance Plan for 2001, the US Department of Defense was even more specific, contending: ‘China possesses the munitions production capabilities necessary to develop, produce and weaponize biological agents’.
Convening a hearing on China’s proliferation practices in 2003, the US–China Economic and Security Review Commission was informed as follows:
The US believes that despite being a member of the Biological Weapons Convention, China maintains a BW program in violation of its BWC obligations. The United States believes that China’s consistent claims that it has never researched, produced or possessed BW are simply not true, and that China still retains its BW program. 
Although China has submitted its voluntary annual BWC confidence-building measure (CBM) data declarations every year, the US Department of State assessed in 2005 that the information submitted therein continued to be ‘inaccurate and misleading’. Further, ‘BWC CBMs since 1991 have called on the States Parties to declare, among other things, their past offensive activities, which China has not done. On the contrary, China insists it never had such a program at all.’
Likewise, in 2007, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) testimony for the US Senate, the Select Committee on Intelligence, entitled ‘Current and Projected National Security Threats’ (in both open and closed sessions), contended that the DIA believes China ‘continues to maintain some elements of an offensive biological weapons program.’
The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the DIA and intelligence agencies in other countries most probably continue to carefully follow and monitor China’s Biological Warfare Program. Irrespective of publicly bringing out their findings—if partially—or totally keeping them, Beijing’s BWP entirely persists in all likelihood. It is assumed that it includes an extremely secretive operational, sizable BW arsenal, extremely hidden, which is steadily being upgraded.

Dr. Xiangguo Qiu – Chinese Biological Warfare Agent,"Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is a Chinese biological warfare agent caught smuggling Coronavirus and other lethal viruses from Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory to China in a case of a Biological Espionage.
EXCLUSIVE: Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It (watch here Visualizing The Secret History Of Coronavirus)
Watch the exclusive interview of Bioweapons Expert Dr. Francis Boyle on Coronavirus Biological Warfare blocked by the Deep State
In July 2019, a rare event occurred in Canada, whereby a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) in Winnipeg, a facility they worked in, running parts of the Special Pathogen Programme of Canada’s Public Health Agency. Experimental infections – including aerogenic ones – of monkeys with the most lethal viruses found on Planet Earth comprise nearly a routine therein.
Four months earlier, a shipment of two exceptionally virulent viruses dealt with in the NML – Ebola and Nipah viruses – was on its way from NML, ended in China, and has thereafter been traced and regarded to be improper, specifically put as “possible policy breaches”, or rather but an “administrative issue”, ostensibly.

— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 24, 2020

Yet the scope of this incident is much wider, in actuality. The main culprit seems to be Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, an outstanding Chinese scientist, born in Tianjin. Heading until recently the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies section of the Special Pathogens Programme, she primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens.
But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses, Ebola virus foremost, in the NML. The two viruses shipped from the NML to China – Ebola and Nipah – were studied by her in 2014, for instance (together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra). Yet utmost attention has been paid to Ebola, with the highly legitimate aim of developing effective prophylaxis and treatment for infected people.
Inevitably, her works included a variety of Ebola wild strains – among them the most virulent one, with 80% lethality rate – and much relied on experimental infections of monkeys, including via the airways. Remarkable achievements were attained, indeed, and Dr. Qiu accepted the Governor General’s Innovation Award in 2018.
So far so good, seemingly. But the collateral Chinese plexus cannot be ignored. Married to a Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML (specifically the “Science and Technology Core”), and primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology – Dr. Qiu frequently visited and maintained tight bonds with China, generally speaking, and many Chinese students joined her works in the NML during the recent decade, coming from a notable range of Chinese scientific facilities. Nonetheless, among the latter there are four facilities that have been regarded to possess parts of the Chinese biological weapons alignment, namely:
Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchu.
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region.
Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei.
Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing
All of the four mentioned facilities collaborated with Dr. Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, yet the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus too. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 (originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006), against Ebola and additional viruses.
However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and fruitful, in certain aspects. They are apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons developing, in case Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein, which is a plausible postulation; let alone the wild type viruses in themselves. And it is of note that only Nipah virus is naturally found in China or neighboring countries.
Collectively, then, the interface between Dr. Qiu and China has a priori been highly suspicious. On top of it, the shipment of the two viruses from NML to China apparently generated an alarm, beyond its seeming inappropriateness. And an unavoidable question is whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.
At any rate, the controversial shipment brought about the entering of information technology specialists into Qiu’s office after hours, for her computer. Consequent to the incident, security access for Dr. Qiu, her husband and the Chinese students was revoked. Her regular trips to China also started being denied.
Weaponizing Biotech – China's War for Biological Dominance#coronoavirushttps://t.co/MEVQ5VERJw
— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) January 25, 2020

Notably, Dr. Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility, and in March 2019, the Chinese published their tour de force.
Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary-general of NATO, said at a news conference he couldn’t comment on this specific case but appeared to suggest the possibility of espionage. “What I can say in general is that we have seen increased efforts by the nations to spy on NATO allies in different ways,” he noted. Connectedly or not, Dr. Qiu collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.
Finally, the multiplicity of the Chinese grants – all of on a national level – supporting the works done under the leading of Dr. Qiu in the NML is rather intriguing; included are:
National Key Program for Infectious Disease of China
National Key Research and Development Program of China
National Natural Science Foundation of China International Cooperation and Exchange Program
Special Foundation of President for Ebola virus research from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
President’s International Fellowship Initiative from the Chinese Academy of Sciences
China National Key Subject of Drug Innovation
Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
National Natural Science Foundation Award, Ministry of Science and Technology
National Science and Technology Major Projects
Beijing Advanced Innovation Center for Structure Biology
Major Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China.
Certainly an impressive list.

— GreatGameIndia (@GreatGameIndia) February 6, 2020

In sum, there is still a possibility that Dr. Qiu and her husband will return to work in the NML. Yet beyond the administrative dimension of this complicated affair, it is largely also a matter of intelligence analysis and assessment, which might constitute a ‘gray area’. A challenge for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. Time will tell, sooner or later.

Canada Investigates China’s Biological Espionage,"Canada has launched an investigation into China’s Biological Espionage. Bio-warfare experts question why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China.
EXCLUSIVE: Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It (watch here Visualizing The Secret History Of Coronavirus)
Watch the exclusive interview of Bioweapons Expert Dr. Francis Boyle on Coronavirus Biological Warfare blocked by the Deep State
In a table-top pandemic exercise at Johns Hopkins University last year, a pathogen based on the emerging Nipah virus was released by fictional extremists, killing 150 million people.
A less apocalyptic scenario mapped out by a blue-ribbon U.S. panel envisioned Nipah being dispersed by terrorists and claiming over 6,000 American lives.
Scientists from Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory (NML) have also said the highly lethal bug is a potential bio-weapon.
But this March that same lab shipped samples of the henipavirus family and of Ebola to China, which has long been suspected of running a secretive biological warfare program.
China strongly denies it makes germ weapons, and Canadian officials say the shipment was part of its efforts to support public-health research worldwide. Sharing of such samples internationally is relatively standard practice.
But some experts are raising questions about the March transfer, which appears to be at the centre of a shadowy RCMP investigation and dismissal of a top scientist at the Winnipeg-based NML.

“I would say this Canadian ‘contribution’ might likely be counterproductive,” said Dany Shoham, a biological and chemical warfare expert at Israel’s Bar-Ilan University. “I think the Chinese activities … are highly suspicious, in terms of exploring (at least) those viruses as BW agents. “
James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said it’s worrisome on a few fronts.
China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized, he said.
That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine, said Giordano, co-head of Georgetown’s Brain Science and Global Law and Policy Program.
“This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.”

Asked if the possibility of the Canadian germs being diverted into a Chinese bio weapons program is connected to other upheaval at the microbiology lab, Public Health Agency of Canada spokeswoman Anna Maddison said this week the agency “continues to look into the administrative matter.”
The agency divulged last week that it sent samples of Ebola and henipavirus — which includes Nipah and the related Hendra — to China in March. It was meant for virus research, part of the agency’s mission to back international public-health research, a spokesman said.
Last month, an acclaimed NML scientist — Xiangguo Qiu — was reportedly escorted out of the lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team. The agency said it was investigating an “administrative issue,” and had referred a possible policy breach to the RCMP. Little more has been said about the affair.
China has been a signatory to the Biological Weapons Convention since 1984, and has repeatedly insisted it is abiding by the treaty that bans developing bio-weapons.
But suspicions have persisted, with the U.S. State Department and other agencies stating publicly as recently as 2009 that they believe China has offensive biological agents.
Though no details have appeared in the open literature, China is “commonly considered to have an active biological warfare program,” says the Federation of American Scientists. An official with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defence charged last month China is the world leader in toxin “threats.”
In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production.
China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post.

Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination.
Nipah, which was first seen in Malaysia in 1998, has caused a series of outbreaks across east and south Asia, with death rates mostly over 50 per cent, and as high as 100 per cent, according to World Health Organization figures. It can cause encephalitis, an often-fatal brain swelling, and has no known treatment or vaccine.
The Johns Hopkins exercise — called Clade X — involved a version of Nipah modified to be more easily passed between people. America’s Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefence prefaced its 2015 report with a scenario involving the intentional release of Nipah by aerosol spray.
China’s extensive and controversial use of CRISPR gene-editing and weaponizing  Biotechnology makes it conceivable the country could bio-engineer germs like Nipah to make them even more dangerous, Giordano said.

Chinese Researchers Caught Stealing Coronavirus From Canadian Lab,"One of Canada’s top scientists says he’s surprised and dismayed an “administrative matter” resulted in the sudden eviction of a prominent Chinese Canadian virologist, her biologist husband, and her students from Canada’s only level-4 lab in Winnipeg and prompted an RCMP investigation.

“I think it’s unfortunate. It’s all speculation. We have no idea what the investigation is about. The fact the RCMP is involved to me doesn’t mean anything at all, because they just need somebody external to their investigation,” said Gary Kobinger, professor in the Department of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and director of the Research Centre on Infectious Diseases at Laval University in Quebec.
Sources say Xiangguo Qiu, biologist Keding Cheng, and an unknown number of Qiu’s students were escorted from the National Microbiology Lab (NML) and their security access revoked on July 5.

Qiu is head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program.
Kobinger said it’s procedure to escort someone from the building if they don’t have a security badge that allows them access.
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) will only confirm it referred an “administrative matter” involving a possible “policy breach” to the RCMP on May 24.
Neither PHAC nor the RCMP are providing further details, citing privacy concerns.

Meanwhile, the University of Manitoba has suspended the appointments of both Xiangguo Qiu and Cheng and reassigned Qiu’s students, pending the RCMP investigation.
Qiu, Cheng and the students all originally come from China.
There has been speculation the case involves the improper transfer of intellectual property or biological materials to China. The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola.
However, Kobinger does not believe Xiangguo Qiu was involved in economic espionage.
“The Chinese, do you see the science they’ve been generating in the past 5 years?” he asked, adding most of the research is published publicly.
“The Chinese – they have so many scientists, it’s unreal. What we can do in six months, they can do in a month. There is nothing, nothing, nothing that I can see from my side that they would benefit from us in terms of knowledge, in terms of re-agents,” Kobinger said. “They have better access to pathogens, everything else, the vaccine, therapies, everything.”

He believes it may be a case of paperwork filled out incorrectly or the breach of a government policy created by bureaucrats who don’t understand how science works.
Or, he adds, it could be a question of mandate because the role of the lab has always been unclear – some say it should just do diagnostics while others believe it should do research.
Until he left the NML three years ago, Qui worked with Kobinger to develop ZMapp, a treatment for Ebola that was successfully used during the outbreak in West Africa in 2014-16. (The World Health Organization declared the latest Ebola outbreak a global health emergency last week.)
Kobinger and Qiu have been recognized for their work, including a Governor General’s Innovation Award in 2018.
Kobinger said he reached out to Xiangguo Qiu by email after hearing the news and she thanked him for his support.
He wishes PHAC could provide a little more information to settle the speculation going on internationally.
“[Qiu’s] body of work is solid. I don’t think it’s going to damage it. But her reputation, I think so, yeah,” Kobinger said in a phone interview.
“If I was in her place, I don’t know if I would ever go back. I would not,” Kobinger said. “So she can take the phone and find a lab anywhere in the world, tomorrow. People may not realize, when you are a top scientist, it’s not hard to move.”
Neither Qiu nor Cheng could be reached for comment.
All of this comes at a time when relations between Canada and China are strained.
Last December, Canada arrested Chinese Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou on a U.S warrant. In retaliation, China has arrested two Canadian men on espionage charges, sentenced a third to death for drug offenses, and shut down imports of Canadian canola and meat.
Kobinger hopes Xiangguo Qiu and her team are not caught unfairly in the middle of a diplomatic dispute.
“Everyone benefits from working together, that’s the nature of science. Again, I think there is clearly other issues that are completely unrelated to scientific research,” he said.

This case has similarities to investigations in the U.S., where authorities have been investigating and warning about the danger of scientists and academics with Chinese connections sharing intellectual property and trade secrets with Beijing. Several have been forced from their positions at American universities and institutions.
The Canadian Security Intelligence Service and NATO have also warned of state-sponsored espionage.
In 2014, Canada claimed China was responsible for a cyber attack on the National Research Council.

A novel coronavirus capable of lethal human infections: an emerging picture,"In September 2012, a novel coronavirus was isolated from a patient in Saudi Arabia who had died of an acute respiratory illness and renal failure. The clinical presentation was reminiscent of the outbreak caused by the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) exactly ten years ago that resulted in over 8000 cases. Sequence analysis of the new virus revealed that it was indeed a member of the same genus as SARS-CoV. By mid-February 2013, 12 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported with 6 fatalities. The first 9 cases were in individuals resident in the Middle East, while the most recent 3 cases were in family members resident in the UK. The index case in the UK family cluster had travel history to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. Although the current evidence suggests that this virus is not highly transmissible among humans, there is a real danger that it may spread to other parts of the world. Here, a brief review of the events is provided to summarize the rapidly emerging picture of this new virus.

The threat of respiratory viruses
Whenever a new virus associated with an acute respiratory illness emerges, medical authorities around the world are put on high alert and vigilance, and quite justifiably. Emerging and re-emerging viruses causing respiratory infections have been responsible for outbreaks resulting in millions of deaths. The pandemic influenza viruses of 1918, 1957 and 1968 are our bleak reminders. Since 1968, major outbreaks with mortalities on the scale previously seen have not occurred, although there have been regular threats.
The novel coronavirus
Recently, a novel coronavirus has been identified in patients with severe acute respiratory illness [1,2]. This new virus, provisionally referred to as novel coronavirus (NCoV) has been fully sequenced and shown to belong to group C β-coronaviruses [3-5]. The genome, which is just over 30 KB, contains at least 10 predicted open reading frames (ORFs) [4]. The genome size, organization and sequence analysis revealed that the NCoV is most closely related to bat coronaviruses BtCoV-HKU4 and BtCoV-HKU5 [3-5] first isolated in 2006 from bats captured in Hong Kong [6]. The major difference between NCoV and these bat coronaviruses is in the region between the spike and the envelop genes [5]. The NCoV has 5 ORFs while the bat viruses have 4 in this region [5]. The nearest human coronavirus related to NCoV is SARS-CoV [3-5]. This virus was responsible for the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002–2003 which resulted in 8,422 cases worldwide with 916 deaths [7]. With a mortality of approximately 11% seen with SARS-CoV infection, the identification of NCoV from patients with similar acute respiratory illness as with SARS-CoV is of a real concern. Coronaviruses are a large family of enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a number of different species, including humans. They are usually species specific, however interspecies transmission of coronaviruses can occur [8-10]. Worryingly, in vitro studies show that NCoV is also capable of infecting cells from different species, including monkeys, humans, bats and pigs [2,11]. Indeed, NCoV was first isolated using monkey kidney epithelial cell lines, Vero and LLC-MK20, both of which are susceptible to infection and can propagate the virus relatively easily [2]. Prior to the isolation of NCoV, only five coronaviruses, namely 229E, OC43, SARS-CoV, HKU1 and NL63, were known to cause infections in humans [12]. In the absence of any underlying co-morbidities, all of these coronaviruses, except for SARS-CoV, are generally associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections. SARS-CoV has an unusual predilection for infecting cells in the lower respiratory tract. Although NCoV also causes lower respiratory tract infection, the viral receptor appears to be different from that used by SARS-CoV [11,13].
Timeline for confirmed human cases (in chronological order of reporting)
As of 15 February 2013, a total of 12 laboratory confirmed cases of NCoV have been reported to WHO [14]. The first 9 of these cases have been from the Middle East: 5 cases (3 fatal) from Saudi Arabia, 2 cases from Qatar and 2 cases (both fatal) from Jordan (Figure 1). The most recent 3 cases (1 fatal) were in individuals living in UK.
20th September
22nd September
The second case was in a 49-year old Qatari patient [16]. He had a history of travel to Saudi Arabia from 31st July to 18th August, but no evidence of contact to the first case [16]. He developed a mild respiratory illness on 3rd of September which progressed to pneumonia and he was hospitalized in Doha on 9th September [17]. His condition further deteriorated and he was transferred by air ambulance to London. Tests for common causes of his severe respiratory illness were negative [17]. The report of the isolation of a new coronavirus from the Saudi case led the medical team to test for the new virus. The test came positive and the case was reported to the WHO on 22nd September [18].
4th November
No new case was reported during October. Then in early November, the Saudi Ministry of Health reported the 3rd case [19]. A 45-year old man was admitted to hospital on 12th October with severe respiratory illness. He was a heavy smoker with a number of underlying chronic conditions, including type 2 diabetes, an atrophied right kidney, and a history of ischaemic heart disease [20]. Over the next few days, his condition deteriorated with progressive pneumonia and renal failure and required mechanical ventilation and hemodialysis. As with the previous two cases, laboratory tests for common respiratory viruses were all negative [20]. However, samples tested for NCoV at three different laboratories, one in Jeddah and two in UK, all returned positive. In spite of his underlying conditions, by 27th October the patient’s condition had improved and he was eventually discharged on the 4th November.
19th November
The fourth case was announced by the Saudi Ministry of Health on 19th November and published by ProMed-Mail two days later [21]. The patient was admitted with respiratory illness and the novel coronavirus was suspected as a possible cause. Samples were tested for the novel virus at reference laboratories in Saudi Arabia and UK and returned positive. The patient succumbed to his infection and subsequently died from renal failure [22].
23rd November
On 23rd November, WHO reported 3 additional confirmed cases, 1 from Qatar and 2 from Saudi Arabia [23]. The Qatari man was initially admitted to a hospital in Doha in October with severe respiratory illness, but he was subsequently transferred to a hospital in Germany. Laboratory results confirmed that he was positive for the novel coronavirus. He remained in hospital for approximately a month, but he recovered from his respiratory and renal illness and was discharged in the week of 18th November. The Saudi cases (cases 6 and 7) (Figure 1) are of particular interest as these were from a single family and were related to case 4 [22]. All 3 cases lived in the same house [24] and it is believed that case 4, a 70-year old man, was the index case in this cluster. He is thought to have infected two of his sons, one of whom (case 6) subsequently died of multi-organ failure. A fourth case from this family also presented with similar symptoms, but laboratory tests revealed that it was not due to the novel coronavirus [24].
30th November
At the end of November, WHO reported that two cases that had died of an unknown respiratory infection in April 2012 in Jordan were retrospectively tested for the new coronavirus and found to be positive [25]. These cases were part of a cluster of 11 cases, 8 of whom were healthcare workers who presented with a severe respiratory illness that was unexplained at the time, but was notified to the WHO [25].
11-15th February: family cluster
On 11th February 2013, the UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) confirmed a further case of the novel coronavirus in a 60-year old UK resident [26]. The patient was admitted to hospital on 31st January 2013 with severe lower respiratory illness. Prior to his illness, he had travelled to Pakistan (from 16th December to 20th January) and Saudi Arabia (from 20th – 28th January 2013) [27]. It appears that his illness developed while he was in Saudi Arabia. Laboratory tests confirmed NCoV infection. Interestingly, this patient was also co-infected with H1N1 2009 pandemic influenza [27]. At the time of writing this review (15th February 2013) the patient was being treated in intensive care (ICU).
A few days after the announcement of case 10, the HPA confirmed the diagnosis of two further cases, one on 13th February [28] and one of 15th February [29]. Both of these cases were family members of case 10 and neither had any recent travel history. They appear to have contracted the infection from their relative [30]. Case 11 was admitted to hospital on 9th February after a short history of respiratory symptoms. The patient had pre-existing medical conditions, which may have made him more susceptible to respiratory infections [27]. On 19th February, the HPA reported that this patient succumb to his illness and died [31] Case 12 on the other hand did not have any pre-existing medical conditions and the latest reports indicate that she has recovered. The HPA has also reported that they have identified and followed up over 100 contacts of the cases in this cluster and all have tested negative for novel coronavirus [31].
Source and mode of transmission
The original source of infection and mode of transmission to humans is unclear. At least 2 cases were reported to have visited farms and may have had contact with animals [20,32]. Thus a zoonotic infection is a possibility. Furthermore, the fact that the NCoV is most closely related to bat coronaviruses [3-5] indicates that it might have originated from bats. Studies showing that SARS-CoV was most likely to have derived from bats [33] also supports a zoonotic origin for this new coronavirus. However, it is unknown whether the NCoV was transmitted to humans by a direct interspecies jump or it involved another intermediary animal. In the case of SARS-CoV, civet cats were identified as a likely intermediate host [8,9,33]. Like SARS-CoV, the exact natural reservoir species of the NCoV also remains to be identified.
Most of the laboratory confirmed cases of NCoV do not appear to have had any contact with animals. Could there be human-to-human transmission? The two clusters of cases, one from a family in Saudi Arabia, the other from a healthcare team at a hospital in Jordan and the most recent UK cluster of cases certainly suggests that human-to-human transmission is very likely. In the family cluster, 3 members contracted the infection. The index case is thought to be a 70-year old grandfather admitted to a hospital in Riyadh with severe respiratory illness. His two sons took in turns to stay by him during his illness (Dr Ziad Memish, personal communication). In spite of all supportive care, the patient died of renal failure. Both of his sons subsequently also contracted the infection and one of them died of multi-organ failure some days later. In the Jordanian cluster, 11 cases (7 nurses and 1 doctor) presented with an acute respiratory illness of unknown aetiology in April 2012 [25]. Two of the cases subsequently died. Retrospective testing confirmed both cases to be positive for the NCoV [34]. Investigations of the non-fatal unconfirmed probable cases in this cluster revealed that the illness in these cases was generally mild [24]. Indeed, in one case, the symptoms were mild enough to be managed at home. The cases in both, the Saudi and Jordanian cluster had no reported contact with animals. Similarly, the most recent laboratory confirmed cases from UK (cases 11 and 12), also had no contact with animals or any history of travel to the Middle East. Both appear to have contracted the infection from a family member who had recently returned from Saudi Arabia [30]. Together, these anecdotal observations clearly indicate that person-to-person infection, probably via respiratory mode of transmission, is highly plausible.
Based on the data we have so far, NCoV does not appear to be highly infectious in humans. None of the first 3 confirmed cases (2 Saudis, 1 Qatari) have been associated with transmission of symptomatic disease to close contacts [20,32]. Detailed follow-up of 64 close contacts of the Qatari patient, which included healthcare professionals, family members and friends, only 13 individuals developed respiratory symptoms, but none of these cases were positive for NCoV [32]. This would suggest that human-to-human transmission is limited.
Clinical features associated with the novel coronavirus
All of the cases had one thing in common: they suffered from severe respiratory illness which was not due to any of the known viral or bacterial causes. The most common initial symptoms were reported to be fever, cough and shortness of breath. Patients rapidly progressed to severe pneumonia and renal failure. The latter presentation has not been seen in all patients. For examples, none of the cases in the Jordanian cluster had renal failure [24]. The two fatal cases in this cluster, one developed pericarditis and the other had disseminated intravascular coagulation [24]. Coronaviruses predominantly cause mild self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections. The only other human coronavirus that is associated with severe lower respiratory infection is SARS-CoV [35]. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV [36,37], this novel coronavirus does not appear to cause diarrhea. Of 12 laboratory confirmed cases, 6 have died and 1 is currently in ICU. This would imply a relatively high mortality rate. However, caution has to be exercised, since we do not know the true prevalence of infection with NCoV. It is possible that in some cases, the virus is associated with mild respiratory tract infection which goes unseen and only those patients who develop severe disease seek medical attention. It is also worth noting that all of laboratory confirmed cases have been adults.
Diagnosis of the novel coronavirus
The novel coronavirus can be cultured from sputum samples using monkey kidney cells, Vero and LLC-MK2 cells. Viral induced cytopathic changes are seen in these cells within 1–2 weeks of infection [2]. However, these changes are not specific for NCoV and confirmation using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) is required. RT-PCR can also be performed directly on clinical samples such as respiratory swabs. An optimized real-time RT-PCR protocol for the specific detection of NCoV has been developed and is available [1]. Furthermore, an additional confirmatory RT-PCR assay and a serological test using convalescent patient serum has been established [38].
Concluding remarks
The emergence of any novel virus, in particular one that can be transmitted via the respiratory route, has to be taken seriously. A rapid response, a united global front and mobilization of resources and expertise are our best tools in preventing or reducing the devastation that some of these viruses can cause. This is exemplified by the recent events that have led to the recognition and isolation of the novel coronavirus responsible for acute respiratory illness. Within weeks of the first report, a PCR-based diagnostic assay was made available [1], a preliminary case definition [39] and incubation period was issued [40], the virus was fully sequenced [4], the detection of new cases was rapidly communicated to the health authorities and more recently, guidelines for handling and working with this virus have been issued [24]. The novel coronavirus is the 6th member of the human coronaviruses and the third to be isolated in the last ten years. Based on current information, NCoV does not appear to transmit easily or sustainably between people, but it can lead to serious lower respiratory tract infection and renal failure. The mode of transmission has not been conclusively identified, although respiratory route looks most likely. A study which is in press, has shown that a number of different bat species resident in Ghana and parts of Europe are infected with coronaviruses very similar to NCoV, in some cases differing by less than 2% at the genetic level [41]. These findings suggest that NCoV is most likely to have arisen from bat viruses. However, a number of pertinent questions remain unanswered: Does NCoV represent an interspecies jump of a bat coronavirus? How did humans acquired the infection? Was it a direct infection from bats to humans or did it involve an intermediate host such as domestic animals? Are the virus isolates from all infected persons genetically identical? Do NCoV genetic variants exits in the human population, but cause mild or asymptomatic infections? Future studies will no doubt attempt to address these and other related questions. For the time being, surveillance and thorough investigations of cases with unexplained severe respiratory illness, particularly in those residing in or returning from Middle East, is being recommended [24].

Taiwan Intelligence: SARS – A Chinese Bioweapon,"Taiwan’s top national security chief was forced to apologise after suggesting the deadly SARS virus could have been developed in Chinese laboratories as a bio-weapon.
EXCLUSIVE: Coronavirus Bioweapon – How China Stole Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponized It (watch here Visualizing The Secret History Of Coronavirus)

National Security Bureau director Tsai Chao-ming “expresses his sincere apology that his gaffe … has caused misunderstanding and concerns,” the bureau said in a statement.
Tsai stirred up controversy on Monday after telling lawmakers that Taiwan had intelligence linking the SARS virus to research done in Chinese labs.
“The bureau listed it as a biochemical warfare agent. We have certain evidence and we have asked UN experts to look into this and that there are some areas involving China,” Tsai said.
SARS triggered a global health crisis after emerging in China’s southern Guangdong province in November 2002, infecting more than 8,000 people and causing nearly 800 deaths worldwide, including 349 in China and 73 in Taiwan.
The pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the government to disclose the relevant intelligence information and demand an explanation from Beijing.

If the SARS virus were to be “used as a bio-weapon, it would cause irreparable harm to mankind. We urge the international community to intervene and investigate,” said DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang.
Taiwan and the mainland have been governed separately since they split in 1949 at the end of a civil war, but Beijing sees the island as part of its territory awaiting reunification, by force if necessary.
